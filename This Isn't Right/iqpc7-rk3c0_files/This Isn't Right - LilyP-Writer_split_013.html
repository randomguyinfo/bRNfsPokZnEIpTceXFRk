			Title: This Isn't Right...<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>By: LilyPWriteryahoo.com<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: Now most of the plot is mine...I did use the shower one, but
everyone uses that...mothers voice from somewhere in cyberspace, "If
everyone used Viagra, would you?" Well, I don't think it would effect me
as much as it would others. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>I just want to say: Thank you for reading my fic. It means so much to me
that you took out the time to read and to review. I love you all. Please go
to my web site: <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 13: Can You Resist? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>As the school year was coming to an end, most of the 7th years were in high
spirits. The thought of no more O.W.L.s, N.E.W.T.s, homework, or Snape kept
a permanent smile upon the Gryffindors' faces. Some 7th years, like the
Hufflepuffs for example, were crying their eyes out the day before the End
of Term Feast. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny found herself packing very carefully before the feast, making sure
that everything was in its place and everything was in her trunk. She even
was caught, by Dawn, stealing the wash towels from the girls' bathroom that
had the Hogwarts seal on the right-hand bottom corner. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Although Ginny was happy to be finishing school, she knew deep down, under
her happy smile and her mask of joy, that she was going to miss the place.
Quidditch wasn't really her main thing, but she had started back up in
Charms Club, and tiny Professor Flitwick was her favorite teacher. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>What Ginny decided she was really going to miss the most were her friends.
Dawn was going to work for the Ministry, in the Magical Creatures
department. Kiki was going to be a writer at 'Wicked Witch Weekly.' Colin
was going to take pictures for the Daily Prophet, and Kyan was going to
work in Hogsmeade at a Pub. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny knew she would see them all again, but not everyday like she usually
did. Part of her said to thank her lucky stars because she had been around
them so long, but the other part knew she was going to cry. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny attended the feast, sitting with the other 7th and 6th years. Colin
and Dennis were crying, Dawn was giggling with Kiki as Tony, a very cute
7th year, walked by, and Kyan was smiling at Ginny. "What?" she asked. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh, nothing." Kyan turned back to his food, smiling more. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No, tell me!" Ginny prodded him with the end of her fork. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well," Kyan sighed, not wanting to be shish-ka-bobbed on the end of her
fork, said, "I was just remembering the first time I saw you. I used to
have a huge crush on you." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Ginny practically yelled, "But you're--" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I know, but I wasn't always this way," Kyan pointed out. "I have dated
girls before," he added in a whisper. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You," Ginny smiled, "used to have a crush on me?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan laughed, "Yes, you crazed lunatic!" Kyan gave her a gentle push into
the Gryffindor next to her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey," Sara yelled at Ginny, whose head was on her shoulder. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sorry," Kyan and Ginny said as Ginny sat up quickly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Dumbledore stood up and raised his arms in the air, looking around the room
and smiling. "Another year," he said, "done." His eyes swept over the room,
as did the teachers', all looking at their students. "I must say that I
will miss this year just as much as I missed the year before." His eyes
moved toward Harry, then he looked directly at Ginny and said to the room,
"I pray that the relationships we have made over this year will last, for
we must all be united." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The twinkle in Dumbledore's eyes seemed to sparkle at Ginny in a knowing
manner. Ginny's stomach did a flip as she looked over at Harry with a face
of worry and fright. Yet Harry was smiling at her, and he winked before she
turned away quickly. Sara and Beth were looking at her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You're together, aren't you?" Beth snarled at Ginny. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No," Ginny said simply. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, you are! I just know it," Sara barked quietly at her. "Plus," Sara
said with satisfaction, "he is our teacher and if it happens to slip to
Dumbledore that you two are involved before this feast is over, you will be
expelled. No Ministry work for you." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny's face must have given away the truth. She and Harry had been doing
things that no teacher should be doing with a student. Ginny glanced at
Kyan as if to say, 'Help me!' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Beth smiled evilly and said, "I'll just get up and tell Dumbled-" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>At that moment Dumbledore called everyone's attention back to himself, "I
do have bad news. Professor Potter has decided to resign from his current
position. So, he is no longer your teacher." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You were going to what, Beth?" Kiki asked with a gleam in her eyes. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Nothing," Beth grumbled, sitting back in her seat. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Sara shrieked, "We can still tell them, they were involved before
Professor Potter resigned!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No, Sara," Beth warned. Ginny glanced at Kiki who had a satisfied smile on
her face. It was as if Kiki had flipped the switch that made Beth stand up
to Sara, while at the same time cowering in Kiki's shadow. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What do you mean?" bellowed Sara, "I'll do it then!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No, you won't, Sara." Beth gave her a warning glare. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What's going on?" Ginny asked Kiki, who went back to her piece of cake. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Everyone's eyes were either on Kiki, who had a victorious smile on her
face, or Beth, who was looking at the table. Sara's bottom lip was hanging
down and she began to kick Beth under the table. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kiki glanced at Ginny and gave a face that said, 'Tell you later.' That
face didn't help. Ginny wanted to know now. She let out a giant sigh and
looked up at Harry, who was staring at her. He winked and Ginny began to
blush. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The twinkling in his eyes was a sort of gleam of amusement. Ginny's stomach
flipped, it was this Harry that she liked the most, not the gloom and doom
Boy-Who-Lived. This Harry, the new-and-improved Harry, the one who killed
Voldemort last year: he was her favorite. He was cool, calm, and collected;
not shy, jumpy, and crazed. Harry had changed, most definitely, for the
better.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>As Ginny and company made their way to the Common Room, bellies full and a
sadness about them, Dawn remembered Kiki's tie over Beth and asked her
about it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well," Kiki said with a smile, making sure only her friends could hear
her, "I'll tell you." Kiki grinned and pulled them into an empty classroom,
lighting her wand so they could see her face. "A few weeks ago, I was doing
homework in the Library." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Homework?" Kyan asked with an eyebrow lifted. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ok, I was reading up on Greg Flamox, that sexy wizard in April's issue of
Teen Witch." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"OH!" The girls squealed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Anyway!" Colin yelped. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well," Kiki said after a giggle, "I was in the library and Beth came in
and rushed up to me saying, 'Kiki,'" she adopted this mock pitiful voice,
"'you've got to help me! I'll do anything!' And I said, 'Why should I help
you?' and she goes on and on about how she would do anything to return the
favor, all I need to do is ask. Well, turns out that she peed her pants and
needed me to sneak her to the Common Room before anyone could notice." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Everyone began to laugh and joke about Beth and how funny this whole
predicament was when Ginny paused and began to sniffle. "Wh-whats wrong,
Gin?" Dawn managed to ask between giggles. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"This is the last time we are going to laugh in the Charms classroom,"
Ginny rubbed her face as she felt the burning sensation of tears in her
eyes. Her friends slapped her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You freak," they called as they pushed her out of the old classroom and up
to the Common Room, making fun of her the entire way. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The next morning was bright and sunny. A cold breeze seemed to wave good-
bye to everyone. Ginny and her roommates were doing last minute packing and
it seemed to take longer with the occasional tear coming out, the
reminiscing, and the old memories coming back to say ado. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny grabbed one end of her trunk and heaved it out of her dorm and in the
hall outside the door. She pushed it to the stairs and let it clank and
clunk all the way down to the Common Room, (it sounded like an elephant was
running to make it to the train on time). <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny walked down after it and smiled at everyone who was watching. "Going
out with a bang, eh, Weasley?" A very cute Gryffindor 6th year said. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You got it, Matthews," Ginny grinned and put a spell on the trunk to
levitate it out of the Common Room to follow Kyan and Dawn's trunks. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Walking down the seven flights of stairs seemed to take longer than usual
as Ginny paused to remember significant moments that happened in certain
spots. She paused at every floor and even stopped at most picture frames to
say good-bye to their occupants. She even said good-bye to the Bloody
Baron, Peeves, and of course she had to say 'so long' to Nearly-Headless
Nick. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>In the Entrance Hall, her teachers stood lined up saying their good-byes to
the 7th years. Ginny received a hug around the middle from Professor
Flitwick. Snape didn't pay much attention to her, though she knew she would
see him at Order meetings soon. Sprout told her that it had been a
pleasure, McGonagall winked at her, and Ginny was pleased to get a large
hug and a kiss upon the forehead from Headmaster Dumbledore. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>As Ginny ascended onto the grounds she began to feel a weight lift from her
shoulders, a pressure that she never realized was there. Ginny rode in the
horseless carriages across the grounds until she reached Hogsmeade. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Its over," Ginny whispered as she watched her luggage being put in one of
the compartments. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Kyan pushed her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Its over," Ginny said louder to him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What do you mean? Our lives are just beginning!" Colin piped up from
behind her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned and looked at her friends faces. "Well, this is one part of my
life that is over! Done with, finite!" Suddenly all her friends ducked, and
so did some people around her as if avoiding a flying object. "I don't have
my wand out guys, you're not going to lose your heads." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A few people laughed, some mumbling about how things will never change.
Ginny's friends looked a little past her and said, "We'll save a seat for
you." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny raised and eyebrow turned to where they were looking. Harry was
leaning up against a stack of trunks that had not been put in the luggage
cart yet. He was smiling and walked over to her. "Miss Weasley," he said,
"Good morning." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"It is a lovely day, Professor," she smiled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, Ginny, it seems the one time I don't need to hear that, you finally
learn it." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh," Ginny pointed to him playfully, "that's right, I heard you were
fired." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No, no, no, I quit," Harry corrected her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Fired, quit, whatever," Ginny grinned. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry glared lightly and smiled at her, "This means that I am no longer
your teacher. I may not your mentor, but I am your elder, and I demand
respect." He gave her a cocky grin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny blushed and poked him. "Like you'll get it," she joked. "Anyway,
what's your point?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"That means we can't get in trouble--" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Why would we get in trouble?" Ginny shrugged and glanced around, teasing
him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, if we ever decided to get together." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What are you implying?" Ginny asked. She suddenly realized that the space
between them seemed to run out. Harry placed at hand on her arm, then her
pulled her into a lose hug. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well," he said, "I sure know we never did anything at the Masquerade Ball,
Christmas, inside my office, or anywhere else." He winked at her. "So I was
wondering, since we have never done anything together that implies
anything, would you like to go out on a date or something with me?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny was well aware of the fact that the students from the platform were
all watching their teacher and fellow student in a very cozy looking hug,
and the ones not on the platform were watching from their compartment
windows. She could just make out the outline of Sara and Beth a few feet
away from her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well," Ginny paused, "I'm not sure." She looked sideways at him with a
grin on her face. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny, I really like you," Harry said, "I mean, I have for a while. Do you
think that maybe we can get together?" Harry smiled and added, "Of course,
how could you resist me?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny playfully pushed him. He laughed and added, "...because I know I can't
resist you." Harry's eyes began to adopt a gleam of passion. Ginny knew
what was going to happen. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ok, I guess that we can meet up sometime, for coffee or something. But,"
she added, "don't get your hopes up." With that, she leaned in and kissed
him right there, in front of everyone. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>He was right: she couldn't resist him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: This is the last Chapter, I'm almost in tears right now, this is my
first every story to complete and even my very first acceptable story
thanks to everyone who said it was good, it makes me want to cry with joy.
