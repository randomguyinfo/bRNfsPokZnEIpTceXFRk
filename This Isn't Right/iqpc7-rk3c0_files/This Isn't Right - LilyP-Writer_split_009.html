			Title: This Isn't Right...
by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: I didn't ask, I didn't care, I wore a mask, for the fair. So
now I write about Harry Potter, and friends who play fight a lot-ter. (Ok,
I couldn't find a word to rhyme with Potter:) )<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Go Ahead! Sue me! I want to see you try!!!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 9: Its Mutiny!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny walked into the Defense Against the Dark Arts room like she always
did, surrounded by her friends. She took her usual seat in the center and
pulled out her work packet they had started and previous lesson.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan was laughing with Colin who was sitting behind him when Ginny poked
him hard in the arm. "Ow! What was that for?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned to face him, "Sara and Beth are giving me a dirty look." Kyan
looked over at them and noticed they were in deep conversation. "Well, they
were."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Calm down, Ginny." Kyan patted her and Harry entered the room.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Good afternoon class." He put his book down on his desk and walked in
front to sit on the edge like he always did.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Good afternoon Professor Potter," the class chorused. Harry smiled and
began his lesson.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny wasn't paying much attention, she found she worked better without
looking at him because he seemed to make her forget the lesson and daydream
about his lips or his wit or his...<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Magical Creatures," Harry said, with a swish of his wand the chalk picked
itself up and wrote the 2 words on the black board.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled and dipped her quill in her ink bottle and began to fill in
the blanks as Harry proceeded. Kyan giggled a little under his breathe and
Harry smiled at him. Kyan nudged Ginny and she looked up as Harry said, "As
I was saying, Magical Creatures are very unpredictable if they are not
trained." Ginny giggled too.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"If Mister Jeffory and Miss Weasley will please refrain from their
giggling," Harry said with a smirk on his face, "I would like to continue
my review lesson."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled. "Yes, Harry," she said automatically.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Excuse me?" Harry said, walking over to her. "I believe, Miss Weasley, you
are getting to the point were I think the word 'Professor' is not present
in your vocabulary."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled, "Well," she smiled, "Professor," she gave a fake cough that
sounded a lot like 'Harry,' then continued as if she did have that little
spasm, "Potter, I think it is in there, just not in the most used section."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry gave an evil grin, "Have it your way Ginny. How many of you think I
should just give Miss Weasley detention already?" The first hands to shoot
up in the air was her 4 best friends, which she slapped most of them. Then
more people began to.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny noticed Beth try to put up her hand but Sara stopped her and glared
at Ginny. "Well, it looks like most of the class want Ginny in detention."
Harry said turning back to his desk, he grabbed and piece of parchment and
scribbled a little on it and brought it back. "Here, Miss Weasley, see you
tomorrow." The bell rang and everyone started packing to leave.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny Weasley has detention with Professor Harry Potter on Friday Night at
8 pm." Ginny read aloud, emphasizing 'Harry'. Harry smiled at her from
behind his desk, she shook her head. "I'm going to owl mum and tell her you
gave me detention."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I'm going to owl your mum too and tell her that you deserve detention."
Harry said with a wicked cocky grin.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Harr-" She stopped and took a deep breath, "Professor Potter," he nodded
happily, "I don't think I deserve this."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry stood up and began walking out his door saying, "See you Friday, Miss
Weasley."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny stormed out of the classroom and went to the common room.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin was developeing film in a closet one floor beneith the boys dorms. He
had always used that spot because no one ever went in there. There was a
problem with that spot, it was right next to the bathrooms so you always
heard toilet flushing, showers, or conversations going on. He had gotten
used to it.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin was hanging up the pictures to dry when he heard someone mention
Ginny's name. He stood still listening to them talk. When he realized who
it was he nearly dropped the pictures. He quickly made sure they were all
right and left in search of Ginny.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>He searched the common room, he ask a 2nd year to check the 7th year girls
dorm for her, and even the Great Hall but found her in the library.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny!" He panted reaching the table when Ginny and Kiki were.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Ginny asked, flipping through a magazine, "I'm doing homework."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin gave a half grin and then remembered why he was looking for her, "I
have some bad news!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny really doubted that it was that bad but she decided to humor him,
"What is it?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sara and Beth are going to try to get you expelled!" Colin said in a rush.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny fell silent, then took a deep breath, "What?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I overheard them talking about you, they called you names and said they
were going to spy on your detention with Professor Potter." Colin looked
around while saying this to check and make sure no one was listening to
him.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well," Kiki said, rather lazily, "All they'll do is catch Ginny cleaning
the shelves or something, right?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny blushed, "Maybe," she paused, "not." Ginny bite her bottom lip
nervously, "I need to go tell Harry!" She jumped up.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"He has a 3rd year class right now." Colin told her. "Tell him at dinner!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"In front of all those teachers?" Kiki asked, board.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Good point," Ginny said, she began to chew on her finger nails, she did
this when she was really nervous. "How about I send him a note?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh yeah, that's great," Kiki said sarcastically, "Dear Harry, we can't
snog during my detention because two whores will be watching us because
they are jealous of me. Love, Ginny." Kiki turned to Ginny and she was
smiling.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"That was cute, Kiki, I think I'll write him a note just like that," she
said sarcastically.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, I think you should get Colin or someone like that to go tell him."
Kiki flipped another page in her magazine.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What do you mean?" Colin asked.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kiki sighed deeply and turned to him, "You go tell Harry what you heard,
don't say anything like you know about his and Ginny relationship, just
tell him, after his 3rd Year class is over with, that you heard two girls
talking about him and Ginny and you thought it wise to tell a teacher about
their plan."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny looked at Kiki as if she could kiss her, instead she hugged her, "You
a genius!" Ginny turned to Colin, "Can you do that?" Ginny gave her best
puppy dog face, "Please Colin."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I don't know, Gin."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"We will make sure to tell Dawn it was all your idea and that you are
Ginny's knight in shinning armor," Kiki said lazily.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Really?" Colin asked, straightening up. Kiki nodded. "Ok, I'll do it!" And
he was off.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: What does Harry do during the detention? Hmm...<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Ok, my sister and her two kids came over which caused me to slow down
with my writing so maybe I won't get chapter 10 out today. And I just found
out that I'm going out of town tomorrow, so nothing till Saturday or
Sunday. I hope you can deal with this for now....<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>If I do get Chapter 10 out, it will be short, like this one(sorry) but I
will make she not to do a cliffhanger, because if someone did that to me, I
would die!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Love, Lily:)
