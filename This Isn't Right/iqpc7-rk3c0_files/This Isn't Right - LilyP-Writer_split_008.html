			Title: This Isn't Right...
By: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: Ok, I didn't ask Jo if I could use her material but, me and Jo
are like this *crosses fingers to represent two very close people* and me
and Warner Bros. are pretty tight too! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Please don't sue me. I can't help you *puts on fake glasses with a huge

runs right* <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 8: Picture This <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Christmas was wonderful! The holly, the ivy, the family, and the friends
made Christmas so wonderful; Ginny didn't want to go back to Hogwarts on
Sunday. Yet, on Saturday, the Weasleys decided on a wonderful snowball
fight to end the holidays. Ginny had talked Hermione into playing so she
wasn't the only girl, but she noted how Ron immediately picked her for his
own team, forcing Ginny to play on the opposite side with Charlie and the
twins. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Fred and George ran for the snow fort they made and called Ginny over to
help them. Ginny noticed that they had their wands. "All right, we'll make
an assembly line. Ginny will make the ammunition, I'll bewitch them and
George will fire them." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Bewitch them?" Ginny asked, confused. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, to follow certain people around and crash into them," George supplied
with an evil grin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny reluctantly agreed, but after making a pile of snow balls so big it
was almost as tall as she was, she decided to go on the road. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny, feeling a little like James Bond, snuck up to the edge of the fort
and saw a mound of snow on the other side. She made a ball and began to run
to the mound of snow, throwing the ball in Bill's direction, who was on
Ron's team. "Ow!" he yelled as the ball of snow hit his chest. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny hid behind the snow bank, feeling her shoes getting wet, and started
making another snow ball. "I can see you Gin!" she heard Ron shout. Ginny
ducked her head and made another ball. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Watch out, Gin!" Fred called out to her. She saw Ron walking her way with
a snowball, Ginny molded the two she just made into one big one, hiding it
behind her back. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey, Gin!" Ron said from the other side of the small hill. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny stood up just as Ron threw it, missing her by nearly a foot. "Hi
Ron!" she said as she threw the snow ball, which was as big as his head, at
his neck. She ran for dear life to the hill on the other side, giggling
like crazy while sloshing through the white snow. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey!" Ron yelled, "Harry, get her!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry ran out from one of the hills and grabbed Ginny around her waist,
tickling her. She collapsed on the mushy ground and tried to crawl away,
but Harry grabbed her and straddled her waist. He began to tickle her like
mad. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh my goodness," she panted in between fits of giggles. "Stop!" she
shrieked. "AHH!" She grabbed his wrists and said while pating, "Give me a
minute." She sighed deeply and nodded, and Harry began to tickle her again
until she cried, "Uncle!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry got off of her with a victorious smile on his face. He clutched her
wrist and said, "I've got a prisoner!" Ron, Bill, and Hermione cheered. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"NO!" Fred and George yelled, "We will avenge you!" Ginny giggled as she
was taken over to the enemy side by Harry Potter, who brought her behind a
particularly big mound of snow and gave her a quick peck on the cheek
before sitting next to Hermione. She was smiling and gave him sideways wink
as he started helping her make snow balls. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny felt like a giddy child again. She made little doodles in the snow,
listening to her brothers yelling war strategies to each other. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny had already put her stuff up in her dorm; she was back in the common
room with her camera. She had taken pictures all during Christmas break and
Colin had offered to develop them for her. She handed him the small camera
so he could make her copies. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hold up," Colin said, "you have one picture left!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled and looked at Dawn, "Dawn, get up!" Ginny grabbed her hand and
pulled her next to Colin, "Pose!" Dawn put an arm around Colin and smiled.
Colin, on the other hand, blushed so bad that he looked like a Weasley.
"Thanks!" Ginny said handing the camera to Colin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"J-just gimme a minute," Colin said and just walked up to the boys' dorm. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin came back a while later and handed her a parchment envelope, which
she put in the inside pocket of her jacket. "Thanks Colin," Ginny said,
turning around. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I put that picture of Ron and the bat in there. I forgot to give it to
Professor Potter...maybe you can give it to him?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny nodded and left the common room. She walked down the hall, looking
through the pictures, laughing and watching things like the Christmas tree
falling on Ron, (thanks to the twins), or herself getting tickled by Harry
in the snow. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny put the pictures back in her pocket. She didn't know where she walked
or how far, but realized that this was the corridor where Harry's office
was. She decided that she would just let him see them. That's it; see them,
that's all, nothing more. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She smoothed her hair out and made sure that she didn't have anything on
her face as she knocked on the door softly with her knuckles. "The door's
open," Harry's voice came from inside. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny opened it and walked in, the only light coming from a big lamp next
to his desk. "So it is," Ginny said, looking at Harry as he was squatting
to get something off the bottom shelf. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny," he said happily, standing up and walking over to her. He closed
the door and she backed up into it. "You came to see me and it hasn't even
been one day." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Don't get too happy, Potter. I just got something for you." Ginny said,
holding back a smile. She knew what was coming. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Something, huh?" Harry smiled and leaned in. He whispered, "Something like
this?" He lightly kissed her and she felt her knees weaken. She felt like
she was going to melt into a puddle on the floor. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>When he left the kiss to look at her face she smiled shyly and said, "You
know, we shouldn't do that." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Do what?" Harry said in mock confusion. "Do this?" He said in the same
voice as before, kissing her again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, that!" she whispered. "Harry I just don't think--" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Excuse me," Harry said, giving her a fake glare. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Professor Potter," she said a little louder, "I just don't..." She sighed,
"This isn't right." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled, "Is it so wrong?" He lightly kissed her cheek, and she felt
the blood rush up to where he just planted that feather-light touch. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I don't kno--" She was cut off by kissing him again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry straightened up and placed one of his hands on her waist and felt
something in her pocket. He abandoned the kiss and said, "What's this?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny pulled out the parchment envelope and handed it to him, "Pictures
from Christmas. That's what I had for you." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry walked over to the desk and sat down, and Ginny joined him to look
over his shoulder. The second he pulled out the pictures there was a knock
at the door. Ginny, in shock of almost being caught, looked down at Harry.
He didn't seem too perturbed about it, however, and said very lazily, "Its
open." Then he returned to the pictures and give a short chuckle at one of
them. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The door opened and who should walk in but Sara Cummings in a mini skirt
and tank top with a blue jean-jacket. 'Isn't she cold?' Ginny thought,
glaring at her and receiving one in return. 'Wait, she is cold blooded so
what would it matter?' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry looked up to see who it was, and then looked back down at the
pictures, obviously thinking they were more interesting. "Is there anything
you need, Miss Cummings?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh," she said, smiling at him even though he wasn't looking, "I just
wanted to give you your Christmas present." She handed him a large black
quill with a silly red bow on it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Why, thank you, Miss Cummings, I'm sorry I don't have anything for you."
Harry placed the quill in one of the cups that he kept on his desk. Ginny
automatically touched the beaded bracelet that Harry gave her for Christmas
and put a smug smile on her face. "Is there anything else, Miss Cummings?"
Harry asked politely when she wouldn't move. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I was just wondering if we could talk?" she said. Harry, still looking
down at the pictures kept chuckling at weird moments as though Sara wasn't
standing there. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"About what, Miss Cummings?" Harry asked after moving the picture he was
just looking at to the back of the stack. "Oh, that one's great!" Harry
said as he pointed to one where Ron's face was covered in the icing from
his mother's Christmas cake, "Can I keep it?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny giggled, "That's blackmail material! Are you kidding? I'm keeping
it." She grinned and put the picture in her pocket. He laughed and turned
back to Sara. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Um, about--school," she pulled from the top of her head. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What about school?" Harry asked, wanting something more specific. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Help with homework," she said, trying to be seductive. Ginny's face glowed
red with anger at her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I have not given any homework for the holidays, Miss Cummings," Harry
pointed out. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I-I know, I mean with other classes. Like, erm, Charms." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"There is a Charms Club that meets every Tuesday." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Herbology." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Madame Sprout is putting scarves on the Grogria Humpras right now, you can
go help her." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Potions!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I barely passed potions myself." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Muggle Studies!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Do you even take Muggle Studies?" Harry asked, glaring at her. "If you're
just planning on wasting my time, I think you should go," he said politely
and she turned around, looking defeated. She walked out of the office,
closing the door behind her. "She is a very annoying student. She isn't
your friend, is she?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Are you kidding?" Ginny said, taking Sara's spot in front of his desk.
"You know who my friends are!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Colin." Harry smiled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, he is one of them." Ginny said, wondering if she was going to have to
stick up for Colin in a minute. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"K-hi-an." Harry said, still flipping through the pictures. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, and Kiki and Dawn." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh, this is my favorite, can I keep it?" It was the picture of Harry
tickling Ginny in the snow. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I wanted to keep it, but go ahead," Ginny smiled. Harry's cocky grin
appeared on his face again as he walked around the desk and handed the
parchment envelope to her. "I need to meet my friends before dinner," she
told him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Now?" Harry asked, backing her up into the door. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes," Ginny said, feeling around for the knob. Harry smiled and leaned in
to kiss her. She moved her hand around faster to find it. 'Eureka!' she
said to herself as she twisted the door knob before he could kiss her, "See
you later!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Bye," Harry said sadly. Ginny shut the door. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>'Why did I do that?' she asked herself, heading back to the common room. 'I
really like him. He makes me feel good...I know why, you dolt. You don't
think he really likes you. You remember what Kiki said about 'Sexual
Tension.' He could just have all that teenage lust built up inside of him;
he really hasn't had a real, true girlfriend, not even Cho. He has only
kissed or been kissed by 3 girls, not including all the times he has kissed
you.' The voice in her head sounded bitter. 'He just wants a snogging
buddy!' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: Class boycott and Ginny ends up in detention?? WHAT? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Thank you all for reading. I want to get at least chapter 9 up today.
Maybe Chapter 10 too?? I'm almost done! YAY!!! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Wait, I'm almost done:( I hate endings because it means its over. DAMN! Oh
well, I just need to start a new one:)
