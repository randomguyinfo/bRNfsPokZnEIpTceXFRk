			Title: This Isn't Right...
by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: I like Harry Potter, so sue me!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 10: Spy Games<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny left dinner on Friday with a comforting nod from her friends. She
noticed that right after she left her seat that Sara and Beth practically
bolted out of the Great Hall.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny gave them a head start before really going to Harry's classroom. She
opened the door and Harry was sitting on his desk looking at a book. "Miss
Weasley," he said not looking at her, "there is chalk on the table, pick it
up and write 'I will show respect to Professor Potter,' on the board until
it is covered completely." Ginny nodded and went to the board, she wanted
to catch Harry's eye but he was concentrating hard on the book.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny had only written it on one forth of the board when Harry stood up and
walked around the classroom. Ginny didn't want to turn around and look at
him so she continued using the chalk to write the inscription on the board,
which was rather humorous if she wasn't in this position. Harry walked up
behind her like he was inspecting her work and whispered, "I know where
they are. Shh..."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry turned around and sat down at his desk and graded his papers. Ginny
wondered why he wasn't exposing them if he knew where they were, but she
forgot when she had finally reached the bottom of the board and wrote the
last word in flourish.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Very good, Miss Weasley. There is an eraser on the table, please erase the
entire board." Ginny looked at the table where the chalk was and now there
was a black chalkboard eraser. She put the chalk, which was one long and
now was much shorter, and picked up the eraser and began to erase all her
markings. She found this much quicker than writing it.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>When she did the last swipe, Harry came over to inspect, "All right, now,"
Harry pointed to a window, "there is a window, clean the eraser." Ginny
sighed and walked over to the window and opened it so she could stick her
upper half out the hole and she began to beat the eraser on the side of the
building. The white smoke got all over the brick and stone of the building
and all over her hands. She began to feel a tickling feeling on her
forehead so she raised her hand to wipe it away and went back into the
classroom.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Here," Harry handed her a tissue, "you have chalk on your face." Ginny
wiped it away and tossed the tissue in the waist paper basket and placed
the erase on the table next to feather duster. "Know, Miss Weasley, if you
wouldn't mind, please dust the shelves."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny gave a large sigh and took the duster to the shelves and moved them
rather sloppily over the books and knickknacks. Ginny sighed when Harry
came over and spotted her work, she know it was horrible and was just
waiting for Harry to tell her to redo it but instead he said, "Very good,
Miss Weasley, now would you please move on to the cabinet?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny glared at him as if saying, 'What?' He winked at her but kept his
steady face. She placed the feather duster on a desk and reached for the
handle of the large cabinet, she noticed that there were screens on the
doors that she couldn't see well through. "Its locked, Professor." Ginny
said after trying the handle for a few seconds.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh here," he held his wand to the door and muttered a spell and it clicked
open. He pulled both doors open flamboyantly and spotted Sara and Beth
clutching a camera and trying to hide behind it, Ginny tried not to giggle.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Miss Cummings, what are you and Miss Green doing in my cabinet?" Harry
asked in mock horror. When they didn't answer he said, "Detention, for both
of you!" They both didn't look as unhappy with it as she thought they
should have.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh," Sara said with a hint of a smile on her face. "Anything you say
Professor, when shall we have our detention with you?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"With me? Oh no, I am sure Professor Snape needs some help in the dungeons,
the 3rd years had a small explosion in his classroom and I'm sure he would
be only too delighted to have you help him clean up the muck."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>'That's more like it,' Ginny thought as their faces fell and the look of
terror was displayed on them. Ginny smiled sweetly at them.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Now, girls, please leave, oh and," he grabbed their camera and pulled out
the film and tore it up, "you can get this back next class." Harry walked
over and put it in his drawer.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>When they left Ginny smiled, "You sly devil."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry couldn't help but smile as he locked the drawer. "I try." Was all he
said as he walked to the door and motioned for Ginny to come his way. "I
know what you mean now. I'm sorry. If I didn't find out from Colin about
them, we could have been in deep trouble."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny nodded and gave him a peck on the cheek. "Good, I don't know, maybe
once in a while we can see each other outside of class, but we have to take
extra precautions." Harry nodded and smiled at her.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Ginny asked, "Why are you looking at me like that?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry grabbed a piece of his robe and lifted it to her face and wiped off
something on her cheek it was the chalk she had missed. "It looked like--
nevermind."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned a light pink, "I would never to anything like that!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled, "Either that or you would never tell me if you did." She
giggled, "Was that a 'never!' giggle or a 'that's right!' giggle?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled her eyes and gave him a small hug, "Bye Harry, I mean,
Professor Potter." She left the room and made her way back to the Common
Room.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny had just finished telling her friends what happened in low voices.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"And Colin came up with that idea?" Dawn asked, impressed.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes," Kiki said, a little annoyed. "He heard them too."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Dawn smiled sweetly at him before laughing, "You had chalk all over you
face the whole time?" Ginny shrugged. "I wish he didn't ruin the film, that
would be some really weird pictures.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny nodded. "I can't believe he made me do all that work!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan laughed, "Aw poor baby's boyfriend make her do detention?" He said in
mock baby voice, the rest laughed.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled her eyes with a smile on her face. "Well, boyfriend or not, I
am going to stay away from him for a while." She wasn't smiling anymore.
"That was too close. He even said it."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin sighed and said, "Well, Ginny, it is probably for the best, maybe you
should really have waited until you graduated." Ginny glared at Colin. "I
mean, if they try to do it again and really catch you, you could get
expelled and the Minister of Magic isn't as nice as Dumbledore, he wouldn't
let you get Auror Training if he found out."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny looked away. Kiki glared at Colin and Dawn just watched Ginny. Kyan
pushed Colin hard and tossed a Sugar Quill at Ginny. "Well," Kyan said,
"atleast the year is almost over. You'll be legal in less than 6 months."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny snorted, "6 months," then began laughing because she was snorting.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>They all joined in and decided to get out of the gloomy mood and start
joking around again.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Wow, this one had more than I thought it did, so I fixed all the forgotten
letters, the wrong spellings and the just plain weird things in it!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: Time passes, but will Ginny? N.E.W.T.S are about to start,
not to mention all her 'Sexual Tension' for Harry and his for her...<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Thank you everyone! Sorry this will be my last chapter for a few days!
I will try hard to get 11 up. I think the last Chapter will be 12 or how
about Lucky #13. I really don't think I will do a sequel because I'm not
sure how I would do that. I only will if I find the inspiration.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Tell me what kind of stories you like and I'll try that for my next fic!!
