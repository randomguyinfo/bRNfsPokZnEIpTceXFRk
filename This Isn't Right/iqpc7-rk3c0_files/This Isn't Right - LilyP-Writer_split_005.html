<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_6">*Chapter 5*: Who Was That Masked Man?</h2>
			Title: This Isn't Right... by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: Alright, I did it, I broke the law! I STOLE HARRY POTTER!
*cries and goes to padded room* <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Please don't sue! I promise that I won't download a million songs! ((Can
you believe that they have to pay a huge fine for downloading MP3s, sure it
was like a billion songs worth zillions of dollars, but gosh!)) <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 5: Who Was That Masked Man? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Halloween morning was beautiful, the sky was a light gray, the promise of
rain was sweet. Ginny got up happier than she had been in weeks. She was
the first one to wake up out of everyone in her dorm, and therefore she
raced to the showers so she could get the good stall. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Breakfast smelled wonderful, as the odor carried up to the 2nd floor. She
jogged down the steps with her friends, and showed her clumsy streak by
falling down the stairs. She tumbled to the bottom, her bum skinned by the
stone steps, on to someone's feet. She pushed her skirt over her legs so as
not to give anyone an early Christmas present. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny heard a familiar laugh from above her and a hand reaching out to help
her up. She looked at the owner of the hand, "Michael," she whispered.
"Thank you," she said letting herself be lifted to her feet, ending up
being very close to him, she took a step back and blushed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I had forgotten how clumsy you were." Michael said, while grinning. "Its
cute." Then he walked away, and Ginny couldn't help but stare as he ran his
finger through his dark, chocolate brown hair. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Snap out of it, Ginny, he is your EX-boyfriend," Kiki said. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I know," Ginny said defensively, but then her tone softened, "but he
called me cute." Ginny blushed again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan rolled his eyes, "Well, you don't look too appealing to me, drooling
like that." Ginny pushed him and walked through the doors to the Great
Hall. It was already decorated with the usual pumpkins and live bats, when
Ginny saw them she began to giggle. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Remember last year, when that bat attacked Ron?" Ginny asked Colin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yeah! I still have the pictures!" Colin laughed loudly with Dawn and Kyan.
Kiki just smiled politely. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You do? Can I have a copy of that?" A voice came from behind Ginny, she
turned around and Harry was smiling at them. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sure," Colin said, trying hard to keep his laughter from taking over his
face again. "I can go get--" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No, no, have your breakfast, just get me one when you can." Harry placed a
hand on Ginny's back and began to walk, "See you later." He turned around
and headed off while Ginny watched his retreating figure. Suddenly Ginny
felt a hand turning her face back to Kyan. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey! You're going to put another mark on my face!" Ginny pushed his hand
off and Dawn laughed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Will you just stop oggling at a different guy every five minutes?" Kyan
steered her to the table for toast and eggs. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No," Ginny said quietly, with a grin on her face. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny walked into the Great Hall at 8:10pm, sure she was ten minutes late,
but she couldn't find her shoe. Ginny and her friends decided to make their
own dresses for the night as well as masks. For her dress, it was cut off
about an inch above the knees and was sleeveless, but over her shoulders
she had a dark red shawl that matched her dress and bird themed mask. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The Great Hall looked just as it did that morning but, like she thought, it
was raining, and it was dark. Thanks to the pumpkins, there was a milky
orange type glow on everything. Ginny walked through the crowds and made it
to the table where her friends said they would meet her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sorry, guys," she said after she made sure that it was Kiki's yellow mask
next to Kyan's navy blue one. "I couldn't find my shoe." Ginny held out her
foot as if to get Kiki's confirmation that it was indeed the matching shoe.
Kiki gave a look of agreement which was Ginny's cue to sit down. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What are we doing tonight?" Kyan asked. Ginny looked around, if she hadn't
seen their costumes she wouldn't have guessed who they were. All you could
see is their lips and chins. Everyone's mask was to cover their foreheads
to their nose. Ginny connected hers to a hat so she could hide her hair. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I don't know, mingle?" Ginny heard Dawn's voice said from behind the cat-
themed mask she was wearing. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sounds good to me," Kiki said, jumping up and following a boy. Dawn
followed suit but it ended up only to be following them to the food. Colin
winked at Kyan and left with a bag under his arm. Ginny smiled. 'Go get
her, Tiger!' Ginny thought wildly.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, I don't know what I am going to do." Kyan said, "But I'll find
something." He jumped up as a guy walked by. Ginny rolled her eyes. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny sat for a while, watching the glow of the pumpkins upon the different
masks as people walked up to each other, and danced, and talked. The music
washing over them, as they gained new best friends, boyfriends,
girlfriends, or even enemies. She began to wonder if the couple 5 feet from
her was a Hufflepuff and Slytherin. She giggled to herself, 'If only they
knew...' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Why is such a pretty mask like yours sitting all alone?" Ginny looked up
at the deep male voice. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Excuse me?" Ginny said with a smile on her lips, looking up at the forest
green mask. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"In other words," He said, with a smile on his own. "Would you like to
dance?" He held out his hand and Ginny took it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I'd love to." She allowed herself to be led out to the dance floor, where
they squeezed in between couples until they found enough room to dance. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You know, Ginny Weasley, I have always wanted to do this with you," the
Mysterious boy said. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"How do you know its me?" Ginny asked, wondering if she had a nametag
branded on her chin or something. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The boy smiled and raised his hand to her neck and twisted a strand of
bright red hair around his finger, "I guess you can said that I caught you
red handed." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled, "So I missed one strand and it gave me away?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The mystery boy smiled and said, "I also heard you talking to your friends
and I recognized your voice." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny frowned slightly, "I don't recognize yours." He grinned dancing a
little closer to her, one of his arms around her waist, the other holding
her hand in his. Ginny tried to look through his mask to his eyes but it
was too dark, and she couldn't see. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You know, Ginny," He said, and she could tell it sounded familiar but she
just couldn't put a finger on it, "I've had a crush on you for a while." He
smiled broadly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Really?" Ginny asked, feeling extremely confidant at the moment. "Well, I
would like to tell you how I feel about you," she said as she let the hand
that resting on his shoulder to creep up the side of his neck. "But, seeing
as I don't know who you really are." She rubbed the side of his cheek with
her palm and reached for the mask. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>His hand shot up and grabbed a hold of her wrist gently but firmly, "No,
no, you can't do that." He placed her hand back on his shoulder. "I like my
little game at the moment." She could tell he was disguising his voice. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny put on a pout and looked the other way. "Cheer up Ginny," his voice
whispered in her ear, "I promise that, even though I don't know if you
liked me or not, that after you get to know my witty and charming side that
you will like me very much." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled and looked back at him, "What makes you so sure that you are
witty and charming?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>He grinned and just said, "I have full confidence in myself." Ginny pressed
her lips together. "I know you want to see who I am," she nodded, "but this
game will be fun." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh sure, fun, when I don't even get to see who you are?" Ginny backed away
a little but he pulled her back into his embrace. "You will, if I want you
to." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny and the masked companion talked and danced for most of the night, he
was indeed witty and charming, yet he seemed more nervous as the night was
near ending. "I have to meet my friends soon," Ginny told him. "Can I see
who you are?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>He bit his bottom lip, as he leaned closer to Ginny. She didn't know why,
but she just felt so confidant around him, like she could do anything and
not feel stupid or embarrassed. He touched her face softly with his hand
and moved it to face him, she still couldn't see his eyes but she felt him
looking at her lips, so she looked at his. They were not smiling, but was
slightly trembling, his breath played on her lips. She opened her mouth and
leaned toward him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>His touch was starting to make her a little dizzy, she smiled slightly as
if drunk off this no-named stranger's fingers playing with her skin, her
feelings, and her emotions. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny," he said lightly on her face. He kissed her cheek and Ginny felt
his mouth float across her face to where her lips rested and he kissed
them, softly letting the feeling pass through the both of them. Ginny
became immediately stiff but softened when she felt a warm, wet object ask
her lips for entry. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny let her lips part to let his this masked person's tongue enter her
mouth, the velvet warmth past through her body and her head felt light
again, as though all thoughts left the world, and the only thing that
mattered was her and this boy, this man. She lifted her hand to his neck
and pulled him in further. He began to smile which caused a problem and he
let go of their embrace. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Thank you, Ginny Weasley." He said and backed away. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Wait!" Ginny yelled to him, trying to follow him, "I still don't know who
you are!" She tried to push though the crowds but she lost him. She sighed
and returned to the table. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny was a little upset when the rest returned, all looking extremely
happy. 'They have no right,' she told herself, 'they have not right at all
to be happy when the love of my life left and I don't even know who he
is.' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p> "Ginny, what's wrong?" Colin asked. Ginny noticed that he was back in his
first costume, she could also see a lip print on his neck and that the
bottom part of his face looked flustered, as though he just washed
something off of it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She told them about the guy she meet but didn't get to know his name or
anything. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan laughed, "Well, 'Who was that Masked Man?' right, Gin?" Ginny frowned
but everyone else laughed. "Oh come on, Gin! Lets go back to the common
room." They all agreed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>When walking up the stairs, Dawn talking to her about her masked man, and
how he was so sweet and kind. Ginny then turned to Colin who was smiling in
a goofy manner and blushing. Ginny nudged him and grinned. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny found it hard to sleep that night, her thoughts still on the man who
kissed her; his soft hands, his sweet words, his taste of chocolate, they
all haunted her dreams. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>At about 1:24am Ginny got up out of bed, snuck down the girls stairs and up
the boy's she entered the 7th year boy's dorm like she always did when she
couldn't sleep and made her way to Kyan's bed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She pulled back the curtain and climbed in next to him, he jerked awake,
"Gin," he rubbed his eyes and gave a sigh of relief when he realized it
wasn't a death threat. "Are you ok?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Can't sleep." She said solemnly. Kyan pulled back the covers and motioned
for her to climb in. She did and wrapped her arms around him, "I just keep
thinking about him." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan nodded, "Just sleep." He patted her softly until both of them were
asleep. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>***Thanks to Kim for Beta-ing this chapter!*** <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: Christmas is Coming, the Goose is getting Fat! *sorry, its a
choir song we did last year:) * <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: I think it is a very special thing if there is enough trust that
they'll sleep with each other, and I think that Ginny and Kyan have that
kind of relationship, cute huh? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Anyway, I just thought to bringing in this Masked Man ((I know, the chapter
title is really corny, but if you ever heard of the melodrama you would
understand its corniness to the extreme!
