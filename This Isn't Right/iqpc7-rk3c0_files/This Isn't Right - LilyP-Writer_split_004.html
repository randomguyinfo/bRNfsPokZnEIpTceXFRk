<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_5">*Chapter 4*: Do I Need to Spell it Out?</h2>
			Title: This Isn't Right...
by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: Ok, I didn't make up Harry Potter, that was Ms. Rowling, I
don't own Harry Potter, thats Warner Brothers, but I did make up the plot!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>I just tell people my name is Lily, I don't tell anyone my real name,
address, city, state, or zip code so you can't find me to make me pay
rights or anything *evil laugh* Muhahaha!!!!!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 4: Do I Need to Spell it Out?<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny woke up the next morning, the smell of the night's rain wafted
through her open window. She started mumbling a bit, "Saturday," That night
she told Kiki and Dawn what happened, Kyan said he would tell Colin.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled out of bed to find her dorm empty, she checked the clock, "Its
10am, you sleepy head!" It yelled to her. Ginny growled and pulled on a
pair of blue jeans and a Weird Sisters T-shirt that Tonks gave her.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny slumped down stairs, her stomach growled, she skipped breakfast. When
she reached the bottom step, Kyan was there and he smiled at her, "Get
this," he said, he looked really amused by something, "Colin spent longer
in the bathroom today than I did."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"EWW! Kyan, I didn't want to hear about that," Ginny got a disgusted look
on her face, "Colin is my friend, I really don't appreciate you telling me
he is 'Polishing his Broomstick' in the bathrooms!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan laughed, "No! Look," Kyan pointed to Colin who just walked up to Dawn.
His hair looked wet, "He asked me how to use gel." Kyan giggled in Ginny's
ear.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Colin," Dawn smiled sweetly, "did you do something to your hair?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin looked confused for a second and then nodded slowly, "Yes."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh." She said then bent over her book. Colin looked up at Ginny and Kyan,
both mouthed, "Tell her she looks nice today."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin shrugged, "What?" He mouthed.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled her eyes and mouthed again, "She looks pretty!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin nodded and mouthed, "I know."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan laughed and mouthed, "Tell her that."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You look pretty." Colin said quickly.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Dawn looked up and smiled, "Thank you Colin." She looked back down at her
book.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin smiled for a minute then looked back at Ginny and Kyan. Kyan mouthed,
"Asked her out."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Colin mouthed, frightened.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny put out two fingers like a little person walking in midair. "Oh!"
Colin said, out loud, Dawn looked up and Colin stuttered for a minute then
said, "Want to go take a walk?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan hit his forehead with a disgusted look on his face and Ginny tossed
her hands up in the air and turned around not wanting to look. 'A walk?'
Ginny asked herself, 'Dawn doesn't like that!'<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sure!" Dawn said, standing up and walking out of the common room with him.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned and looked at Kyan, both started laughing. "I didn't think she
would say yes!" They continued laughing.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny spent the day in the library doing homework with Kiki. Their idea of
doing homework together meant sitting in the library doing magazine quizzes
and checking out the 7th year Hufflepuff boys taking books off the top
shelf.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>They didn't skip lunch this time, but noticed who was skipping this meal.
"Where is Dawn and Colin?" Ginny asked Kyan.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>He smiled evilly, "Maybe they are still out on their walk." They began to
laugh, Kiki just flipping lazily through her magazine.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>However, they did make it for dinner. "Enjoy your walk?" Kyan asked Colin
who was sitting in between him and Ginny.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin didn't answer, he looked to see if Dawn was watching but she was
laughing while looking at Kiki's magazine. "Wait," Ginny said looking at
his green jumper. "Were you wearing that earlier?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin's eyebrows scrunched together and he put on a frown, "I fell in the
mud." He looked utterly unhappy about this and it didn't help that Ginny
and Kyan began laughing uncontrollably.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny and Kyan only shut up when the Headmaster stood up. They glanced over
at Dumbledore, who, by-the-way, still looked old. "Students, what with
recent events last year," Ginny's smile faded away a little, he was talking
about Harry's defeat of Voldermort. She looked over at him, the first time
since yesterday. He was looking at her.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny tore her eyes away and put them back on Dumbledore. Why was Harry
looking at her? 'Maybe he just wants to apologize,' Ginny told herself, 'he
shouldn't, I wanted him to kiss me...maybe he is apologizing because he
didn't want to kiss me and he is saying sorry for getting my hopes up, but
I was the one who didn't let him--' Ginny thoughts were interrupted by the
Headmaster.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Our houses still aren't very united so, we are going to have a Halloween
Masquerade Ball. Everyone will get masks that cover the upper part of their
face. There will be dancing and food and there is only 2 rules: 1)Don't
tell anyone who you are and 2)Be yourself."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny giggled a bit, "So, be yourself, but don't tell anyone?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan smiled, "Exactly!" Ginny giggled.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"So that means no dates?" Kiki asked.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yeah, but," Dawn said, leaning in so only her friends could hear here,
"Lets know who each other is so we don't end up dating each other." They
all nodded, Colin's agreement was a little later than everyone else.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny leaned over and whispered to Colin, "You can always change costumes
halfway through the night." Colin smiled at her.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny and her friends were busy over the next couple of weeks working on
their masks and costumes when not in classes or Quidditch practice, which
wasn't a lot of time for Ginny and Kyan, who were both on the Quidditch
team.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny was happy with all her classes now, she was doing so good in most
that they hardly gave her any homework, although she always ended up with
at least a few inches of homework in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Ginny
felt so uncomfortable around Harry, even more that she usually did.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>During the class, Ginny was always looking down at her hands and when Harry
would call on her she would start out her answer with, "Well, Professor
Potter..." keeping her face down, even if she already knew the answer by
heart she would pretend to refer to her notes or books, not daring to look
at him.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Maybe the sense of distance between him and Ginny made Harry ask almost
every question to Ginny and give her 10 points for every right answer.
Ginny and her friends were positive that she earned about one hundred
points a week for just Harry's class. Of course they do lose about one
hundred points a week from Snape.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny seemed to inherit the Twins sense of humor for things, much to the
dislike of Snape but Fred and George were only too delighted at this
discoverment so they send her numerous bewitched candies and sweets for her
to "leave behind" in the common room and watch first years pick them up.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny found, that all the commotion from when a second year who eat a tail
toffee (a wonder toffee candy that made the consumer sprout a tail for an
hour) was too much for her to try and make her costume. Ginny and her
friends would spend times before dinner and during the weekends to run up
to their room to make their masks. Ginny's was a dark deep red, Kiki's was
bright yellow, and Dawn's was black and gold.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>It was about a week before Halloween, which was on a Saturday, and Ginny
found herself, once again, in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Ginny, like
she always did, was keeping her head down.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ewww!" Sara and Beth would yell from the first row as Harry asked them to
pet one of his magical creatures, Kyan would joke about this in Ginny's
ear, "I'm sure," he would whisper, "that they wouldn't mind touching HIS
magical creature." Ginny giggled.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ew, Kyan!" Dawn giggled from behind them.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Of course," Kyan smiled at Dawn and turned his face back to Ginny, "I'm
sure he wouldn't mind YOU touching HIS magical creature."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny slapped his hand and giggled. Colin poked the back of Kyan's head
with his sugar quill and told him to looked up, Harry was starring at
Ginny. Kyan nudged her in the ribs and motioned to Harry who was walking
their way.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Mr. Jeffory, I have wonderful hearing," Harry's eyes twinkled, "and I
wouldn't mind if Ginny touched MY magical creature." His eyes were
twinkling happily from behind his glasses.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny's head jerked up as if saying, 'How could you talk about something
like that about me in front of the whole class.' But her face split into a
smile when she noticed that he was holding out his magical creature, the
real one, not the 'magic wand' or 'flying broomstick' as her brothers and
friends would refer to their...yeah.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny picked her hand up and touched it, it was black and all furry with
two scaly ears and it's belly was bald and red. Ginny looked up at Harry
who looked thoroughly amused. "Thank you," she whispered.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Any time, Miss Weasley, any time." He smiled and seemed to be holding back
a laugh.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan rested his chin on the palm of his hand and stared at Ginny, giggles
escaping his lips and Ginny just pushed his arms out from under his face so
that it would fall a few inches. But that was the best payback she could do
at the moment because Harry was playing with his magical creature which
caused more giggles from the 5 friends.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>I revised it!! Yay! Ok, just a few more chapters to revise them I can add
12 and 13!!! WOOT!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: The Masquerade Ball, does Ginny find someone to help her get
over Harry? Does Colin work up the courage to tell Dawn he likes her? Does
Kyan wear a dress? (Ok, the last one isn't really an option, -x- that one
out:) )<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Thank you to Rita3 for the 2nd Review, I will do spell check or
something *I should have done that but I hate the computer not being able
to find "Gryffindor" or "Quidditch" or even "Dumbledore" Can they be so
stupid???*<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Also thank you to Carmine007, I love the idea of Harry teaching Ginny, but
I never found one, so I did it myself. I hope you keep reading!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>If you noticed how I don't leave cliffhangers. I don't like to keep people
in suspense, I nearly wet myself when people do that to me:)<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Review telling me what I need to improve and sorry this chapter is sorter
than the others. I had to come up with a mini plot for Ginny to be
'somewhat alright' with Harry.
