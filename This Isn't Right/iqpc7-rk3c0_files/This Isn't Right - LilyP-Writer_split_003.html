			Title: This Isn't Right... by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: I admit it, I didn't get permission from Warner Brothers or
J.K. Rowling. Cuff me now, Cop-er *holds out wrists* <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>If you want to sue, good luck getting more than 3 Chocolate Brownie
Frappiccinos((I love you Starbucks, I wouldn't be here without you!)) and
about 238 pairs of plastic earrings...'Cause that is about all I have:) <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 3: Maybe I Should... <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A few weeks passed and, thank Merlin, the weather got colder. It still
wasn't cold enough to wear cloaks, but Ginny and her friends could all be
seen with their scarlet and gold Gryffindor scarfs around their necks. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry's classes were very interesting. After Ginny's display of her
Patronus, they did simple reviews of last years jinxes and curses. The next
week they worked on some of the same stuff they did in the DA. It was a lot
of fun for Ginny and Colin. They were in the DA so they got top marks in
everything Harry taught them. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>They were just finishing one of their lessons on a Thursday in early
October. "All right class, very good today, five points to Colin for NOT
shattering my black board this time." Colin began to blush fiercely. The
bell rang and everyone got up to clear their things and get out the door.
"Have a nice day. Oh, Ginny, can you please stay after class for a
minute." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny nodded and her friend made "Owww," sounds and said things like, "Your
in trouble now, Gin!" Harry heard them and just smiled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, Harry?" Ginny said, approaching his desk after her friends left the
room. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled and said, "Excuse me?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled her eyes, "Professor Potter." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You know, if you keep calling me Harry, I will put you in detention,"
Harry put the emphases on 'will.' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled her eyes and heard something behind her. It was Sara and Beth,
they seemed to be cleaning up Beth's falling bag but they didn't seem like
they were in too much of a hurry. Ginny glared as she noticed they were
straining their necks to be able to hear Harry's conversation with their
roommate. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What did you want, Professor?" Ginny teased silently, leaning on the
desk. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry looked up at her and placed a hand on hers. "Have tea with me in my
office tomorrow after your last class." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny straightened up and heard glass breaking. She turned around, Sara
broke a bottle of hot pink ink. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry ignored them and pulled Ginny back to look at him, "I haven't heard
from Ron and Hermione, I want to hear how your family is doing. I've missed
them this summer." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny bit her bottom lip and nodded reluctantly, "Tomorrow, my last class
is History of Magic, I get done at 2:30." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled, "See you at 2:45 then?" He laughed and she nodded. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Bye Harry." He coughed loudly, "Professor Potter," she growled as she
exited the room where Sara and Beth were waiting for her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Are you and him," Sara paused as if to find the words. "Together?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled her eyes and walked down the corridor, "No," she said when
they caught up to her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Did he just ask you out?" Beth asked, she was panting from trying to keep
up with Ginny. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No." Ginny rolled her eyes and jogged up the stairs. "He is just an old
friend of the family who didn't get to see them this summer. He just misses
his best friend, my brother." Ginny started to run up the stairs two at a
time. How she did this, she didn't know, she had very short legs. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>'Thank Goodness,' she said to herself when she reached the common room. She
had lost the two vultures. Ginny collapsed on one of the sofas between Kyan
and Dawn. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You ok? Sorry we didn't wait for you." Dawn said, while putting down her
book. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What did he want?" Kyan asked, nibbling on a sugar quill. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny broke the quill in half and took the piece that wasn't in his mouth
to suck on. "He wanted to ask me to tea tomorrow afternoon." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Did you say yes?" Colin asked, getting out of his stupor. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes," Ginny said stuffing the sugar quill in her mouth more. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Gin!" Colin yelled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"It's not a date or anything. He just wants to talk about Ron and
Hermione." Ginny felt a little upset because she was probably right, all he
would want to talk about is Ron and Hermione. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Did anyone hear him ask you?" Colin's high pitched voice gave a little
squeak. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes," Ginny began to sit up straight. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Who?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny pulled one of her legs onto the couch and she rested her chin on her
knee, "They just walked in." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan, Kiki, Dawn, and Colin all looked up to see who just entered through
the portrait hole. Sara and Beth were talking in low voices and they
spotted Ginny. They raised their hands to cover their mouths and sprinted
across the room and up the stairs to their dorm. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"That didn't look good." Kiki said after a swipe of the emery board on her
nails like she was doing before. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You can say that again." Kyan said quietly, still looking at the stairs. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Dawn heard him and started laughing, "All right, 'that didn't look good.'"
She managed to say through her giggles. Colin, who was sitting on the floor
leaning over the coffee table doing homework, looked up at her and began
laughing, sometimes saying, "Good one," before drowning in laughter again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny looked at Kyan and they rolled their eyes in unison. Kiki was too
busy filing her nails to really pay attention. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny left the History of Magic classroom the next afternoon with her
friends laughing at her. "What?" Ginny rubbed her eyes, 'That darn bell,'
she thought, 'I was having a perfectly good nap.' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kiki, who never really laughed this hard before, pulled out her compact and
handed it to Ginny, pointing to her left cheek, laughing uncontrollably. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny grabbed it and opened the small mirror, listening to her friends
gales of laugher. "What?" She moved the mirror so she could look at her own
left cheek. "Oh My God!" Ginny spotted the reason why her friends were
laughing so hard. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>In History of Magic, Ginny was in such a stupor that she rested her head on
her hand and fell asleep. Her hand left a large red mark on her face.
"Damn!" she yelled, and started rubbing her cheek. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kiki giggled, "Try to see if you can cover up the red with my make-up." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny grabbed the small pad and swiped it in the creamy colored powder.
With one hand she held the mirror up to her face, with the other she spread
the powder over her red hand print. "Its not working!" she cried. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kiki looked down at her watch and started giggling again, "And you only
have five minutes to get to Harry's office for tea." Ginny growled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Forget it!" she barked, still climbing the stairs, "maybe he won't
notice." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>They all started laughing again. Kyan patted her arm, "Right, maybe he
won't notice that you have a Grand Canyon sized hand print on her face!"
Ginny slapped his arm and walked down the corridor, leaving her friends
laughing hard, walking up the stairs to the common room. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny reached Harry's office and she lifted her hand to knock softly on his
door. "Its open," his voice rang from inside. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smoothed out her hair and silently prayed that her hand print went
away. Ginny slowly turned the cool metal of his doorknob. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny," he smiled from behind his desk. She closed the door and he stood
up, "What happened?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>He came from behind his desk. Ginny noticed that most of his office was
still in boxes. "What?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Your face," he pointed to her left cheek. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny blushed as he walked over to her. "Oh, I just fell asleep in History
of Magic." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry laughed and raised his hand to touch her cheek. Ginny felt the all-
too-familiar feeling of her pulse momentarily stopping. "It looks like
someone slapped you." Harry rubbed her cheek with his large, warm hands. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled and closed her eyes, just taking in the feeling. She opened
her eyes again and Harry was staring at her. His green eyes were twinkling
and looked very energetic. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny brought her hand to her stomach as his fingers started rubbing her
cheek, placing runaway hairs behind her ear, and letting his fingertips run
over the edges of her ears and jaw bone. Ginny bit her bottom lip. Her
breathing became shallow and she had to start breathing through her mouth
so not to pass out. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry's fingers began to trace the features on her face. Ginny closed her
eyes and let Harry touch her freckles. She began feeling very light, like
she was being lifted up off the ground, but her feet were planted firmly on
the floor. Harry's fingertips were tracing her lips and Ginny parted them
slightly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry let his hand drop from her face to her shoulder and down her arm as
he brought her into an embrace. His cheek rested on the side of her face.
She closed her eyes and hung her arms limply on his. He slowly backed away.
Ginny had half a mind to pull him back, but her mind and body weren't
really speaking at the moment. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry's eyes were glued on her shoulder and Ginny could feel his warm
breath tickling her neck. He looked back at Ginny, his eyes tracing down to
her lips. She noticed this and her jaw dropped a little in shock. Harry
leaned in a little further, their noses just barely touching which caused
an electrical shock to flow through Ginny's body. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny wanted to close the space between them. They were so close at the
moment that their breath was mingling in each other mouths. Ginny's hands
wouldn't leave her stomach, she couldn't move, glued to the spot in a daze.
Harry began to come closer, he was about to kiss her... <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Maybe," Ginny said turning her face and backing away, "I should..." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry looked at her and backed away slowly. "I should go." Ginny said more
confidently, her eyes were burning and it felt like she had just been
outside in a bad fog. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny didn't wait for an answer. She walked two feet towards the door. Her
legs were shaking and her head felt very light. She grabbed the doorknob
and slowly opened it she stepped out without looking at Harry. She didn't
know what just happened. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny ran down the hall until she was a corridor over and she sunk down to
the floor between two knights so she could think. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny Weasley, what were you thinking?" She said to herself. She pulled
her knees up and hugged them and rested her head on them. She sat there
thinking to herself. "Next time," she told herself sarcastically, "I'll let
my conscience be my guide." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What the Hell, Ginny Weasley?" Ginny looked up to the owner of the voice. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey Kyan." Ginny rested her head on his shoulder as he sat down next to
her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I was sure that tea with Harry would take much more time than this, did
something happen?" Kyan looked into Ginny's eyes and could tell something
did. "What?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny explained to him all what happened. Her eyes were getting watery. "I
was just saying how my subconscience told me to stop. It was a joke, you
know: 'let your conscience be your guide'." Kyan smiled at her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" She whispered, "You're just upset because I got closer to kissing a
boy than you did!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p> <p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan smiled. "Oh, I don't know about that." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Kyan!" Ginny giggled. "You fag!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan shrugged, "What can I say?" Kyan paused, "Yes." They giggled all the
way back to the Common Room. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: Dumbledore makes an announcement, what could it be??? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Yes, if you didn't catch that, Kyan is gay. Just to let you know,
Ginny and Kiki are the only ones who know he is gay, and he is not very
feminine so nobody really expects it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>PLEASE SEND ME A SUB PLOT!!! I don't know if a 4 paragraph chapter would be
very appealing, send me a sub plot and I'll have a longer chapter... <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Wow...this is my 3rd chapter in one day...Maybe its cause I'm just so
board, I'm off school for a week, and just listening to the radio isn't
cutting it.
Clay helped me with this one too! Look forward to the next few chapters to
be revised, I have 4 very good Betas helping me out with this one!
