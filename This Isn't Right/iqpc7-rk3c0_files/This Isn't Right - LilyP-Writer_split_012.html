			Title: This Isn't Right... by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: Ms. Rowling is the nicest, sweetest, smartest, funniest,
bestest(ok, not a word), etc., woman. I want to be just like her!!! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Hope you like-- <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 12: That Masked Man! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>After the N.E.W.T.s were over, the 7th years didn't have any more classes.
The seventeen year-olds were running around the school in high spirits. The
exams were over; no more school! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny found herself out on the grounds, thoroughly enjoying the feeling of
freedom. She owled Hermione a few weeks before school ended to see if she
would have a flat to live in when she left Hogwarts, (the answer was yes). <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny would be attending Auror Training next fall with Harry, Ron, and
Hermione. All but Harry took the year off to raise money for Auror Training
because it was expensive and didn't pay anything. Ginny knew Harry had a
lot of money and he could have started last year, but he didn't want to go
without Ron and Hermione. The twins offered to pay for all of Ginny's
expenses, which she happily agreed to. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>At the moment, Ginny was sitting under a large tree by the lake. She was
reading a horror novel that she didn't seem to be able to finish over the
past few months. She hadn't gotten too far because she kept getting
distracted by a group of boys in a large circle about 5 yards away. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>They were kicking around a ball that looked like a beanbag. The game's
winner seemed to be decided by who could find the weirdest way to hit the
ball to the other side. The person currently in the lead was a light-haired
boy from Ravenclaw. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan and Colin joined in the game just as Kiki and Dawn sat with her, also
watching the sport. She noticed that if a boy missed it and the weird ball
fell, the others would make fun of him and tease him, always checking to
see if the girls were laughing too, (which they were). <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny began giggling as Colin started to be picked on. Dawn glared at her,
"He's our friend. Stop laughing!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned to Kiki, who was smiling with a mad gleam in her eyes as she
said, "Dawn, do you like him?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Of course I like him, he's my friend," Dawn said, turning back to the boys
to see them ask Colin to keep the score. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No, like a BOY-friend, Dawn." Ginny pushed her lightly on her arm. Dawn
turned light pink and pretended to ignore her. "Do you like him like that,
Dawn?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Dawn looked up at her and smiled slowly. "I've fancied him ever since I
found out that he was taking Muggle Studies so I wouldn't be alone, even
though he's muggle-born," she said slowly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny and Kiki began to laugh uncontrollably. Dawn started blushing and
trying to quiet them with 'shush' noises. "No, it's just that he took that
class because he had a crush on you," Ginny coughed out. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Had?" Dawn asked with a pout on her lips. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Still does," Kiki rolled her eyes. She went back to her bored look and
lazily flipping pages in her magazine. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Dawn smiled and began to giggle; "I think I'll go help him with the score
table." Ginny giggled too. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You go do that," Kiki said, bored once again. Ginny just watched the game,
but she decided that playing would be more interesting. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey, guys," Ginny stood up and walked over to the game after a Hufflepuff
lost, "Can I play?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Are you kidding?" a voice came from behind her, "You can't play, its the
annual 7th year boy tournament!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, you're not a 7th year boy!" Ginny retorted to Harry. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I'm not playing, I'm watching." Harry smiled and walked over to her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"So I can't play because I am a girl?" Ginny placed her hands on her hips. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry gave his signature cocky grin and nodded, "Yep, that sounds about
right." Ginny rolled her eyes and took a seat on one of the blankets set
out for the audience. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The game continued. It was interesting at times, the way they could keep
the ball going for longer than 2 minutes. Harry was sitting down next to
Ginny, her cloak thrown over her lower half of her body, keeping her warm
in the cool breeze. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny began getting bored as the guys started making less extravagant
moves. Ginny turned her face to Harry and she rolled her eyes at him. He
smiled and slipped his hand slowly under her cloak to where her hand was
resting and he rubbed the top of it. Slowly, Ginny turned her hand over and
Harry traced circles on the palm of her hand, sending excited chills all
over her body. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny forgot about the game and found herself staring at Harry's arm that
was half-hidden with her cloak. Harry shifted over until he was so close to
her that only a teacup could fit between them. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny parted her fingers to let Harry's tangle in with hers. It felt right.
Well, every time she held a boy's hand she always felt like it was somewhat
right, but this! This seemed like the lost puzzle piece; it just fit. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled shyly and looked over at her. Se blushed furiously and turned
to look so it seemed like she was concentrated on the game. Michael had
just lost, and when he spotted Ginny he walked over. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Lost?" Ginny asked as he sat down next to her. Harry's hand stiffened, but
she didn't look over at him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yeah. I guess I'm just not cut out for this." The golden glow of evening
cast weird shadows across his face. "Ginny," he looked down nervously then
back up. "I heard that you're going to start Auror Training in a few
months?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, with my brother, Ron." Ginny smiled and gave Harry a soft squeeze. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Right," Michael said softly. "I was just wondering because I'm going to
work at the Ministry in about a month or two, if you would like to get
together some time." Harry's hand left Ginny's and she suddenly felt
incomplete. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh," she looked sideways at Harry, whose whole face was turned away from
her. "I don't think that's a good idea." Ginny turned back to Michael. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny," he said softly, holding her hand and bringing it to him, "I was
just immature before. I've changed! I'm not the same boy who called it off
because of a stupid Quidditch match." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny mumbled, "That I won." He laughed and Ginny took her hand out of his,
"But it's not that." She looked again at Harry and he seemed to have turned
his head to listen. "It's just that I don't think it's fair to go out with
you when I have a--" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Boyfriend?" Michael asked, a little disappointed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, sort of. I plan to, you know, bring up a relationship next time we--
" Ginny broke off and smiled shyly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh," Michael said, getting up, "I understand. Maybe we can talk at the
Ministry or something." Ginny nodded and waved to him as he walked off. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry turned back to Ginny with a slight trace of a smile on his face, "So,
is Michael disappointed?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Maybe a little." Ginny said, taking the smile off her face. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Poor guy." Harry said, looking at her from the side of his eyes. "But, I
guess that other chap is pretty lucky." Harry turned to look at her before
turning back to the game, not really paying attention. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yeah, I guess he is," she smiled and looked over at the game again, "Maybe
someday you can meet him." Ginny gave him a sly grin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh, I don't already know him?" Harry asked in mock wonder. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I'm not sure," Ginny smiled, "I'll ask him next time we--" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled and turned to face her, "Next time you--what?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned to face him slowly and said in a very low, raspy voice,
"That's for me to know and you to find out." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry laughed and said so only Ginny could hear, "Maybe I should become a
detective and find out." Harry slipped his hand under Ginny's cloak and
instead of her hand, he found her thigh and decided that it was just as
good, (if not better). <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny's breath caught up in her chest as Harry's light touches on her leg
left white-hot traces of where his fingers were. Ginny placed her hand on
his and he smiled. "Should I get my magnifying glass and we go get some
clues on what you will do with this...masked man?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled, "Are you trying to get me alone?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry looked away, "Well, I'm just curious about what you do with this guy.
Ron's not here, so I have to protect you." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh, I think he's safe." Ginny smiled as Harry's hand found her leg again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh, is he safe? Safer than this?" Harry's hand sailed across her leg until
it reached her inner thigh; he could feel the skin tighten under his touch
and Ginny smiled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Just about," she said with a smile on her face. He grinned at her and
leaned in. "Harry," she pushed him away a little, "We are in public." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry backed away slowly and said, "You want to find somewhere to go?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned back to the game, which was down to three people. "I don't
think so...," Ginny paused, "Professor." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: The last one! BooHoo...
