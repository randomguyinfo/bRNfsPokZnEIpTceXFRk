<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_7">*Chapter 6*: The Invitation</h2>
			Title: This Isn't Right... by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: *announcer voice* Harry Potter belongs to Joanne Kathleen
Rowling and the movies are all thanks to Warner Brothers. ARRRRRRE YOOOOOU
READDDDDDDY TOOOOOO RUMMMMBBBBBLLLLLEEEE?!?!?!?!?!?! *ends and walks away* <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>*grabs a gold pocket watch and swings it around* You're getting sleepy.
You're not going to sue me. You're going to read my story and say I'm

this...*tosses watch and runs for life* <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 6: The Invitation <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>November was coming to an end and Ginny had not found her Masked Man. She
gave Kyan a list of some of the features she remembered, but they weren't
very helpful, because it had been so dark in the ballroom that she didn't
get a good look to begin with. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny had become depressed, but she always found a smile for Harry. He had
spoken to her on Halloween like nothing had happened in his office. She
blamed not finding time to talk to him on her tremendous workload, which
included homework and Quidditch. The first Quidditch Match was against
Hufflepuff and like Ginny predicted in Divination homework, the Gryffindors
won. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>It was the first day of December and Ginny hadn't spotted anyone who was
acting differently toward her. 'It's been a month, give up on him,' Ginny
told herself. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She was sitting at the Gryffindor table, depressed again. "Here, Gin," Kyan
passed her a double chocolate muffin, "get chocolate-happy." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You mean get a sugar high for Transfiguration?" Ginny said, taking a bite
out of it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, McGonagall won't be to happy if you're depressed," Colin supplied
sealing up a large parchment envelope. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, McGonagall won't be to happy if I'm bouncing off the walls, either,"
Ginny said as she took another bite. She didn't really care what McGonagall
thought. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Mail!" Dawn said, giggling. The owls swooped in over the students' heads
to find their owners. Ginny didn't even look up; she just grabbed and piece
of bacon and waited. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Parker!" She cried happily as a large tawny owl landed next to her plate.
She gave him a slice of bacon and untied the letter from his leg. She
opened it up, read it quickly, and sighed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Kiki asked, "Is it from your mum?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yeah, listen to this: <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Dear Ginny, <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"For Christmas you will come home. Sorry, I know you wanted to stay but we
want you at home for the holidays, because we are having everyone over. By
everyone, I mean you must invite Harry also. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Be good! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Love, <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Mum and Dad." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"So, you can't stay over Christmas?" Kiki said in a disappointed tone. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I can't either," Kyan and Dawn said in unison. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin frowned. "I'm not staying either, then," he replied as he grabbed a
quill, jotting a quick note on the envelope he had just sealed. Then he
tied it to his owl, saying, "Give this to Mum." The owl flew off in a mess
of feathers and spilled breakfast.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I guess I have to owl dad and tell him that I'll be home for Christmas as
well," Kiki said in an unhappy manner. She was a little downcast, and Ginny
didn't blame her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey," Dawn said, "we have a Hogsmeade weekend coming up. We can go
Christmas shopping then." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Secret Santa this year?" Colin asked. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Always!" Kiki replied, "I can't afford 4 gifts!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny nodded in agreement. "We'll draw names at lunch?" They all nodded and
headed toward the greenhouses. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Alright, students," Harry said from his desk, "this has been a wonderful
first term, and I don't think we've had anyone fail this course!" Harry
glanced around at them all before continuing his little speech. "Since you
are such a wonderful class," Harry's eyes lingered on Ginny for a moment as
he winked at her, "You may pack up early." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan nudged her as he began putting away his things. "What?" she asked. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I saw that," Kyan winked. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Shut up!" she said, playfully pushing his chest. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No horseplay in my classroom, Miss Weasley," Harry said while smiling at
her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned around and smiled back at him, "It will never happen again
Harry--oops, I mean Professor Potter." Ginny gave a mischievous grin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Don't make me give you detention on Christmas holiday," he smiled at her
with amusement in his voice. The bell rang as he shouted to everyone else,
"Have a good break!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Speaking of Christmas break," Ginny said after most of the class had left,
"how would you like to have a real Weasley Christmas at the Burrow?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled and nodded, "That would be lovely. I'm glad you asked me." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny grinned and turned around to grab her bag while saying, "Don't get
your hopes up. Mum made me." She walked away with a smile on her face.
"Good Bye, Harry," she said, then closed the door. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Saturday was so beautiful. The sky was almost completely full of white
clouds, the ground was covered with fresh white snow, and the Hogwarts
students had a full day to spend on Christmas shopping. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The first thing Ginny did when she reached Hogsmeade, after saying goodbye
to her friends, was go to Fred and George's new shop. It was the location
that they would be running while Lee was taking care of the one in Diagon
Alley. Ginny walked slowly, so as not to slip in the snow and get her jeans
all wet. It was very cold outside, and even though she had a long sleeve
shirt and a jumper on, she still held her cloak around her tightly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She reached a large purple and lime-green shop, and as she entered, a small
bell made an incredibly rude noise. It looked positively wonderful. There
were large colorful signs listing the categories of sweets or jokes that
sat behind them, and kids were running around trying to decide which things
to spend their money on first. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny reached the counter just and Fred and George popped up. "Hey Baby
sister!" George called out, coming around the wooden barrier and giving her
a big hug. He kissed her on the forehead as Fred followed suit. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What are you doing here? Planning to buy a present for one of your
schoolmates at our lovely shop?" Fred asked politely. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Are you kidding? I'd lose my all friends that way!" Fred and George
laughed at this as she continued, "I just came to see you." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Fred put his hand to his heart and replied, "Thank you." Ginny smiled as he
said, "That means so much to us." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>George, who was mirroring Fred, then began pushing her towards the door.
"Now get out! It's bad for business!" Ginny gave a muffled 'humph!' as she
was shoved into the cold, and went to find something to buy for Kiki. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>As Ginny passed the shops she spotted a vintage Jewelry boutique, and it
looked very old and inexpensive. Which is exactly what she needed, because
with having to buy 10 presents this year, she could only afford to spend a
small amount on each person. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The shop was covered in old, dark wood and gave the smell of dust. There
were glass containers filled with the more expensive jewelry, and cardboard
boxes on the opposite side of the shop that were labeled, "5 for 1
Galleon." Ginny smiled and walked over to the box, and saw that it was
filled with tiny plastic bags that separated the different items. Ginny
began to shuffle through the box looking for something her loved ones would
enjoy. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>First she found a pair of cat-eye earrings. 'Hermione,' she thought as she
watched the yellow jewel practically winking at her. She placed them on the
table next to her and then began to dig again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next she found a pendent with the initials MOM on it. She was sure it stood
for 'Ministry Of Magic,' but her mother would never know. Ginny placed it
by the cat eye earrings and started to filter through it once more. A
moment later she found 2 pairs of cufflinks. Thinking they would be perfect
for her father and Bill, she placed them beside the two other items. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>At the bottom of the box she found a string of pearls. It wasn't long
enough to be a necklace, but it looked like it could fit around one of
Kiki's wrists. Ginny held it with the others and went up to the counter to
pay her single Galleon. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rushed out of the shop, putting the paper bag containing her new
purchases in the inside pocket of her cloak. 'Charlie, Fred, George, Ron,
and Harry to go,' she told herself, marking them on her mental list. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>'They all love Quidditch. Maybe I should find something in there.' She
walked in the Quidditch shop, and saw a Chudly Cannons sweater on a
display. She decided that Ron would wet himself if he saw it, so she hung
it over her arm and kept looking. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>There was nothing for Charlie, the twins, or Harry in there so she
continued to shop. At another store she found fireproof gloves for Charlie,
but she hadn't seen anything for the twins or Harry yet. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Walking down the street she almost passed the Three Broomsticks, but she
decided that a little break was in order. But after her 3rd Butterbeer, she
knew that she really needed to get back to work. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Leaving the shop she saw Zonkos and she bought Fred and George the latest
trick: inflatable gum balls. Ginny couldn't find anything for Harry. She
almost gave up on buying anything at all when she remembered something she
already had: a photo of her and Sirius during Christmas in 4th year. And on
the plus side, she looked really good in it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny ran to a muggle-like shop to buy a dark silver frame and then headed
back up to Hogwarts to put away the gifts. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Its not Christmas yet," moaned Ginny as Kiki and Dawn dragged her out of
bed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"But we're all leaving for home today, and we have to spend at least part
of this Christmas together," Dawn protested. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny rolled her eyes and pulled out the present she got for Kiki after she
dressed in her muggle clothes. "All right, all right, let's go." They went
down stairs and Colin and Kyan were already waiting. They were looking
quite festive while singing Christmas carols and hanging up mistletoe. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Merry Christmas," they all yelled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Merry Christmas," Ginny yawned. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Here!" Kyan exclaimed as he handed Dawn a present. She opened it to find
drawing materials and a pad of paper. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Dawn hugged him and handed Colin a present, "Merry Christmas, Colin." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin stared at the present for a minute and opened it with a huge smile on
his face to find a roll of film and 2 bottles of potion that could be used
to make the photos move. "Th-thank you-u," he stuttered as Kyan winked at
Ginny. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin then handed Ginny her gift. She smiled and opened it. "Colin!" she
said, "Thank you!" He had gotten her a camera, and although it wasn't as
good as his, she was happy to receive it. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny handed her present to Kiki, "A pearl bracelet!" Kiki squealed after
opening it, "It matches my earrings and necklace perfectly! Thanks, Ginny!"
She hugged her as the redhead smiled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kiki handed Kyan his present and after he opened it he grinned. "Ha ha ha,"
he said sarcastically. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Kiki asked innocently. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan pulled out a pair of leather pants. The receipt came fluttering out
from under them. "I figured," Kiki said with a small smile on her lips, "If
you were just kidding about the whole 'leather pants are cool' thing, you
could return them for a nice pair of blue jeans or something." Kyan laughed
along with the rest of them, folding the pants nicely. Ginny had a lurking
feeling that Kyan just might keep the pants.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin set up his camera on the table and grabbed everyone in for a group
hug. He waved his wand so that the camera would take the picture as Dawn
told him, "We're all getting copies!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"All right." He replied dreamily. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>***Thanks to Ashley for Beta-ing this!!!!!!!!***<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: Christmas at the Burrow :) There's more, but if I tell you,
you will know what happens in the next chapter and that would ruin my whole
game! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Well, I enjoy this way too much. I am happy about the reviews I have
gotten. I hope to get more, but I am not going to be one of those people
who are all, "I am not going to post if I don't get more than 10 reviews"
because that is just stupid. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Well, I hope you keep reading because in the next chapter something big
happens!!!! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Thank you Kori Bischoff, I agree, they should have, but then my plot
wouldn't be the same. Them kissing, like the masked man said, would ruin my
game! Keep reading, I promise that you will be happy you do! :)
