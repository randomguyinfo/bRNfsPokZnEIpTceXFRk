			Title: This Isn't Right...<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p> <p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: Well, most of the fic is done, and you have read 10 of these if
you don't know it by now, then you may sue me:)<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Enjoy!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 11: N.E.W.T.s<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The months passed, and so did Ginny and her friends. The N.E.W.T.s were
coming soon and Ginny didn't want to take any chances. Since the Quidditch
season ended, (Gryffindor won the cup), Ginny could be found spending her
free time in the Library.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Two hours before school started and during breakfast she would be reading
her textbooks cover to cover. During passing periods she would walk down
the hall with her head buried in one of her old tests. During lunch and
dinner she was in the library reading huge reference books, and class time
was spent writing down extensive notes on what the professor said word for
word.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny's studying problem began to show. Since she studied most of the
night, she didn't wash her hair, but only wet it in a four-minute shower.
She had bags under her eyes, and she began drinking excessive amounts of
coffee.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>People began to notice. Not her friends, though, because most of them,
excluding Kiki and Kyan, where becoming just as bad. Colin began
hyperventilating when the topic of exams was brought up. Dawn had stopped
talking all together and even stopped giggling randomly. Kiki seemed
somewhat normal; she studied but got bored quickly, so she turned to her
magazines for comfort. Kyan was too busy with Charms Club ever since Ginny
stopped going last year, so he was only seen in classes.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>During one of the last Defense Against the Dark Arts lessons they had,
Harry had asked Ginny to stay after class. Ginny agreed, but after all the
students left the room and it was just her and Harry, she yelled, "I have
to go study! There isn't any time!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>rabbed her arm and looked at her with concerned eyes. "Ginny look at
yourself. Have you taken a proper shower today? Or this week?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny glared at him for bringing up something personal, "Harry, is this
really important? I have to study for Transfiguration--"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny," he said softly and loosened his grip on her arm while stroking her
palm with his fingers, "I care about you, I haven't seen you in months, and
you have been consumed by studying. Take a break!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny pulled her hand away and snapped at him, "If you care for me so much,
you would understand my need to pass with full marks. I want to become an
Auror, too. Sure, you can get by with being the famous Harry Potter, the
Boy Who Lived, but I have to get by with being Ginny Weasley. Little,
untalented, pathetic Virginia Molly Weasley."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry's eyes began to come back into focus and he reached out for her but
before she could get away. He pulled her into a hug; a tight, never-want-to-
let-go type of embrace. "Ginny, you know you are wonderful, talented,
beautiful. But, just for one day, take a break. Maybe during the Hogsmeade
trip, or take a long, hot bath, or do whatever you girls like to do."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She giggled in his ear. "Thank you Harry," she hugged back.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry leaned over and kissed her cheek. He took and deep breath and then
coughed, pushing her away, "Just wash you hair, it reeks!" Ginny shoved him
and started laughing.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The exams were in a week and Ginny found herself only properly washing her
hair once every seven days. She would tell herself that there wasn't enough
time, if she wanted get top marks in potions at least.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan was quizzing Ginny on the properties of Humpherian Concoction. She had
gotten 34 out of 35 correct, and she only got that one wrong because Kyan
mispronounced the word "Micrionic" and said it as "Mycrionic." (They are
two completely different magical herbs).<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan tossed her fact cards on the table and said, "Ginny, you need to take
a break!"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You sound like Harry," Ginny grumbled, trying to reorganize the thrown
cards.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Is that what he talked to you about? Calming down about the exams?" Kyan
pulled out a Sugar Quill and shared it with her.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny, who was about to bite Kyan's head off because it was none of his
bloody damn business, softened. Sugar Quills were their candy, the candy
they used while talking to each other about something important. Kyan had
shared one with her when Ginny told him about her crush on Harry, when she
confessed to him about Tom, when he told her that he was gay, when he tried
out for the Quidditch team...everything big deserved at least one lick of a
Sugar Quill.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny blurted out many reasons why she wanted to study, but Kyan just
nodded her on. "What?" Ginny said after what seemed like the hundredth
excuse, "Isn't that good enough?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh they're all good, but I know you Miss Ginny Weasley. Studying gets your
mind off things, well, people at least."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What does that mean?" Ginny asked, giving him a look that said, 'What the
bloody hell are you talking about?'<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, I know that all that sexual tension you're feeling right now is
forgotten when you study the different colors of the kneezles; I know they
don't really turn you on."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny couldn't help but smile, "How do you know that Kneezles don't turn me
on! Maybe I think they're sexy."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan laughed and they felt like they weren't talking about anything serious
anymore. It was just another joking term, which made Ginny lighten her load
a bit.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I just have one favor to ask you," Kyan said, very serious after his fit
of laugher.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What?" Ginny said, turning her face to mirror his.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Smell your hair," he said simply.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny lifted a frizzy, wire-like strand and lifted it to her nose and
breathed in. She coughed, "EHHHH! I'm going to wash my hair now!" She
jumped up and ran to the bathroom leaving Kyan laughing into his Sugar
Quill.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny did begin to bathe regularly and was pleased to have 8 really good
showers before testing began. She noticed on testing day that she was not
the only one who had refrained from showering. Michael Corner didn't look
too good; neither did Greg the Hufflepuff, Tony the Slytherin, Mary the
Ravenclaw, or Fae the Head Girl.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny had just finished the Care of Magical Creatures exam, (the practical
one was in the afternoon after lunch). She discussed the different problems
with Colin. Dawn, still being silent, ate one bite of her grilled cheese
then stuck her nose in a dusty volume about caring for hippogriffs.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>After the practical exam and a hearty wink from her examiner, which was a
telltale sign that she did very well, she got her copy of her written test
and took it to look up the answers to see how she did.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan helped her by stating, "Even though you forgot about the 4 horns in
this question, you got bonus points by saying you can only find them in oak
trees in this question!" Ginny stopped crying when he said that.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The next test was Transfiguration, which Ginny did wonderful on. She
successfully turned her table into a big potbelly pig; she even added a bow
for extra effect. Charms was the day after that, and she did splendidly.
When she got her antique doll to dance and sing 'Happy Birthday' to the
examiner, the old lady clapped loudly. After that was Potions, which she
blew through faster than any of the others, (much to her astonishment).<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Divination was not hard. She just said, "I see a long journey in you
future, a muggle one, it looks like.... a...a boat, a large boat. You shall
be leaving on--the 25 of this month." She only read the cruise line ticket
that was sticking out of his shirt pocket, but he seemed impressed.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Defense Against the Dark Arts was her last test; she finished the first
part easily. The practical exam started and the waiting room was filled
with students, practicing the pronunciations under their breath. "Jones,
Helen," they called and she left with the same bored and lazy look on her
face.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny sat there and watched the students leaving. As the groups of five
disappeared through the door she felt more weight on her shoulders. This
class was the basis of what she was going to do in her life; if she doesn't
do well on it she--<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Vicks, Greg," was the last one in his group to go. Ginny looked around the
room; she was going to be the last one in the next group. She was the only
Gryffindor left, so she kept busy by talking to herself about what to do.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Weasley, Virginia." Ginny jumped up. Her stomach seemed to have left her
and her feet didn't feel like moving, but a Hufflepuff gave her a
comforting push. She tried to thank him but her voice seemed to have gone.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>As she passed through the entrance hall she spotted tiny Professor Flitwick
at the door, pointing people to free examiners. When she reached him he
jumped and squeaked, "Miss Weasley! I have wonderful news," he motioned for
her to bend down so he could whisper it to her. She bent so she was only 2
or 3 inches taller than he was and he continued, "Miss Weasley, you
received top marks in my exam. Not only top marks, but the highest in the
school! Better than the Head Girl!" Ginny smiled. This seemed to make her
feel better about the Defense Against the Dark Arts test she was to take in
2 minutes. "I am sending a letter about your amazing charm work to the
Ministry. You are trying to get into Auror Training, correct?"<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes, sir," Ginny found her voice.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, I will send them an owl as soon as I get back to my office. Mr.
Frankford seems to be ready."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny nodded and thanked him before walking over to Mr. Frankford, a very
old and battered looking man with a pair of very old fashioned spectacles.
He smiled as she walked over. She noticed someone walk up behind his chair
a few yards away. It was Harry. He was apparently going to watch her test.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled slightly. It didn't help her nerves, however. She noticed that
he was smiling at her, not as a teacher but as something else. That smile!
It was the one he used when he was the Masked Man who kissed her. She
suddenly felt the shadow of the kiss on her lips, wishing that she could
just walk past her examiner and snog Harry right there in front of
everyone, but the table stopped her.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny shook hands with Mr. Frankford. "Hello, I'm Virginia Weasley."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hello, Miss Weasley," the old man croaked. He seemed to know her or
something about her from the way he looked at her. "Are you ready to
perform the examination?" He ran through a few hexes, curses, and counter-
curses, and then said, "I have heard a little about you from one of your
Professors. He tells me you can do an amazing Bat-Bogey Hex and a pretty
impressive Patronus. So, how about it? For extra points?" Ginny smiled and
looked up at Harry, who winked at her.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She performed the hex on a cotton dummy, and it worked wonderfully. The
Patronus barked loudly to the entire Great Hall before running to Harry and
then wafting away. "Very good, Miss Weasley," Mr. Frankford croaked as he
shook her hand, "Very good, indeed."<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny received another wink from Harry before she left the Great Hall and
returned to the Common Room for a well-deserved shower and Sugar Quill with
Kyan.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>/center<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: Tests and Classes are over, so is Harry still Ginny's
teacher? Sure Ch. 11 mentioned Sexual Tension, but nothing comes of it.
Ginny still thinks that Harry is her teacher...but is he??
