her last year at Hogwarts. She was listing her top 10 reasons why this year
was going to be the best year. "Number 4: We all have our Apparating
License, even though we can't do it on school grounds." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny suddenly felt the trilling sensation of falling as her foot slipped
on the wet stones, but fortunately, her fall was broken by the steps
rushing up to smack her bum. "Oww..." She opened her eyes and saw all her
friends laughing. She laughed too, and allowed herself to be helped up by
Helen 'Kiki' Jones, who was a beautiful, slender, but shallow blond who
happened to be Ginny's best friend. "Hey," Ginny would respond, when people
asked how they could be friends, "opposites attract." On her other side,
Dawn Davies helped her up. Dawn was a smart girl who would laugh at
anything. It was not uncommon for someone to say, "Dawn, it looks like it's
going to rain," and she would laugh her head off. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny glared at the two boys in her group, Colin Creevey and Kyan Jeffory,
"Some gentlemen you two are." Ginny then dusted off her back side and
continued to walk. She stole a glance at Kyan and glared at him. He
laughed. Kyan was the complete opposite of Colin, who looked as though he
just got out of bed and was ready to face the world. Kyan, on the other
hand, looked as though he spent more than 10 minutes in the bathroom before
he was ready to get his school bag out of his trunk.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Alright, two more. Number 2: We are considered adults even though some of
us don't act like it." She took this moment to start walking backwards
through the Great Hall between the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw tables while
glaring at the two boys. "Ok, finally the Number One reason that it is
great to be 17 years old and in our 7th year at Hogwarts," she gave a
dramatic pause and continued, "No-" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>She had bumped into someone, whose arms where clutching hers so she didn't
fall. She turned around, "Harry!" His green eyes were twinkling at her from
behind his glasses. It was so ironic, she was going to say Harry. The
Number One reason that it is great that they are 17 and in their last year
at Hogwarts is no Harry, no butterflies, no resurfaced feelings, no knight
in shining armor, none of that. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey, Ginny, its good to see you," He leaned down and wrapped his arms
around her, pinning her upper arms to her side. She felt warmth rush over
her and the familiar feeling of butterflies and not being able to form a
simple sentence around him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Harry, w-what are you doing here?" 'Good,' she thought, 'I managed a
complete sentence with only one stutter.' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry let go and squeezed her arm, which made her melt. "You'll find out
soon." He gave a cocky grin and winked at her, then turned back to the Head
table and started to talk to the Headmaster. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny was staring after him with the dazed eyes she usually had when
looking at him. She blushed slightly when she realized that he had just
gave her a hugged and winked. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny? Hello?" Dawn began to wave her arm frantically in front of Ginny's
face between giggles. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sorry," Ginny turned and sat down, "what did you say?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Number 1? No-what?" Colin asked in his high pitched tenor voice.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"No Harry." Ginny sighed and looked back up to the table where Harry was
now talking to Hagrid. Harry sat on the edge of his seat as if he really
didn't belong in it and was waiting for the owner to come back and claim
it. "Guess it changed to my top Nine reasons." Ginny rested her chin on the
palm of her hand. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Gin, you so pathetic." Kiki said while examining her red finger nails. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Thank you, Kiki, for being so sensitive," Ginny said sarcastically. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Shut up," Kyan said, "Dumbledore is trying to talk." The five friends shut
up immediately and looked up at the white haired headmaster who was looking
quite old at the moment. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Welcome newcomers and welcome back to those who have been here before."
Dumbledore motioned to McGonagall to bring forth the Sorting Hat. Ginny
listened quietly to the Sorting Hat's annual song and gave little bouts of
laughter directed toward the First years. She cheered along with the rest
of her table as the small children became Gryffindors and ignored the yells
and cheering from the Slytherin table when they acquired any new residents.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, now that our new students have found their new houses, let me
welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, whom I am sure most
of you know, what being Harry Potter and all." There were a lot of cheers
at this moment. Ginny looked up at Harry who was sitting between Hagrid and
Professor Flitwick. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Her eyes looked the size of Quaffles she was so shocked, she didn't even
start cheering until halfway into it. Harry looked through the crowd at
her. She felt the breath get caught up in her throat. Ginny gave a weak
smile and Harry winked at her. 'Two,' she thought lamely, 'two winks.' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Their eye contact broken, when Harry turned to Hagrid who began to shake
Harry's hand with tears in his eyes. Ginny thought that if Hagrid didn't
stop giving his congratulations soon, Harry might have tears in his own
eyes. Ginny tore her eyes away from him just as Flitwick praised him too. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You know, Ginny," Kyan said, as the cheering died down and the food
appeared, "its not right for you to have a crush on a teacher." Ginny
picked up and dinner roll and threw it at Kyan. He laughed heartedly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny found that she couldn't eat more than a few spoonfuls of soup and a
swig of pumpkin juice. She kept looking over at Harry who was in deep
conversation which Flitwick. Every now and then he would look up at Ginny
and smile, making her blush and feel the butterflies again. 'Stop looking
if you don't want him to catch you,' she kept telling herself. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>After dessert, which she found she couldn't eat much of either, Dumbledore
made his usual announcements. Which included: no magic in the corridors and
the Forbidden Forest is just that, forbidden. Ginny got up and began to
walk out of the Great Hall with her friends. They were talking animatedly
and Ginny stayed quiet. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny!" Harry grabbed her arm and she turned around. So did her friends.
"Ginny, isn't this great?" He looked like a little kid in a candy store who
just got the key to the back room. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled. "Yes, but," Ginny paused. 'Something witty, Ginny, say
something witty,' she yelled at herself. "I won't have to call you
'Professor Potter,' now will I?" 'Ah,' she inwardly shrugged, 'it will
do.' <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Of course you will!" Harry said, as though it was the most obvious thing
in the world. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What if I don't, Harry," she emphasized his name.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>He smiled and leaned in with that cocky grin of his and his eyes twinkled
again. He looked as though he was about to burst out laughing. The mirth
ringing in his low tone as he said "You'll get detention." Then he walked
off. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny smiled and fell back into Colin and Kyan's arms. She struggled to
stand up but she could still feel his warm dinnermint-y breath on her
face. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Was he just flirting with Ginny?" Dawn asked Kiki. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kiki rolled her eyes, "With him, who knows." Kiki turned to Ginny, "Of
course you know him better than we do, was he flirting?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny shrugged and was all pink and flustered. "I don't know. But, Oh
Merlin, I hope so." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Colin slapped her hand. It was joke they shared for a long time. Anyone in
the group who had a bad idea or a bad thought got a slap on the hand.
"What?" Ginny asked turning to him. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny, he is a teacher. You know how many wizard and muggle laws that you
would break if you and he got involved?" With that, Ginny received three
more slaps from Dawn, Kiki, and Kyan. Everyone began to laugh. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Colin," Ginny said suppressing a giggle, "just because I want him and I to
be involved doesn't mean we are going to be. I mean, to him, I am just
Ron's little sister. Also, think about it; Harry graduated last year with
my big brother, Harry practically lived with my family every summer since I
was 11, plus he doesn't know many people still at Hogwarts except me, so he
feels closer to me than usual, he was probably just joking." Ginny said the
last part with a little disappointment. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Gin, remind me again why you had gotten over your crush on him back in 4th
year." Kiki said with a rather bored tone. But Ginny knew better. Kiki was
trying to get Ginny to remember those emotions she used to get over him, so
that she could get over him again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"It was," Ginny said, as she stopped as a large group of Ravenclaws passed
in front of them, "when I had a boyfriend, Michael--" She trailed off
because he just passed by in the group. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Oh..." Kiki looked at Kyan to get him to help her change the subject. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, that settles it then?" Kyan said and Ginny took her eyes off of her
ex, who ignored her, so she could look at Kyan. "We get you a boyfriend."
He said like it was as plain as day. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"A boyfriend?" Ginny bit her bottom lip. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Its not impossible," Kyan pointed out, "I mean, let your hair down." He
pulled the ribbon out of her bun and it fell to her mid back with thick
curls. "Loosen your tie and unbutton one or two at the top." As he said it,
he began to do as such. "Make your skirt a little shorter." He grabbed the
waist and picked it up a little which made Ginny squirm. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Hey, hey, hey!" She poked him, "Watch your hands." She glared at him and
accidentally let a giggle out. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Look," Kyan told the others, who lined up in front of Ginny, "I call it
'Hopeless Case,' but, it will do," he said like an artist. The others
clapped politely or snapped their fingers like people do after someone
reads a poem. Ginny kicked Kyan's backside as he took a bow. "Hey!" He
rubbed his bum and added, "You do look good." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Don't try to butter me up, Jeffory." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Kyan rolled his eyes, "Hysteria," he said and the portrait opened. "Good
night, ladies," he said as he walked up the stairs with Colin. Ginny, Dawn,
and Kiki walked up their own staircase. They were giggling about something
when they entered their dorm. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Will you please shut it," one of their roommates called, "we are trying to
get some sleep before classes tomorrow." Ginny suppressed her giggles and
tip toed around the room grabbing her pjs and pushing her friends. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>As she descended into bed, she remembered that Harry was going to be her
teacher. She just prayed that she didn't have him until Thursday, Friday,
or never.<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Beta-ed by Clay, thank you Clay!<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>I revised this chapter!!!
