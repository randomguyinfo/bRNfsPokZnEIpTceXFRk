<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_8">*Chapter 7*: A Surprise</h2>
			Title: This Isn't Right... by: LilyP_Writer@yahoo.com <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Disclaimer: I'm sorry I have to do this, because I am running out of jokes
for the disclaimer...I just looked at that word, isn't that a weird word?
Think about it, break up the syllables. (Harry Potter doesn't belong to
me!) <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Feel free to sue me, I read somewhere that all you need to sue someone is
you have to ask for ATLEAST $20, that's right, twenty dollars!!! Cool!!
Right??? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>WARNING! WARNING!: The following scenario happens in 1 in every 5 Harry
Potter fanfics, I'm sure with just that being said you can guess what it is
already. I'm sorry I had to be the one in those 5 but subplots are so hard
to come by these days... <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Chapter 7: A Surprise! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny hugged all of her friends good-bye, wishing them a happy Christmas as
they left on the train. She watched the scarlet steam engine ride off
towards the horizon with all of its grace and beauty. She only wished that
someday, when she was older, she could come back and ride it again. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned around and saw Harry smiling at her from a few feet behind.
"Ready to Apparate?" she asked him, dragging her duffel bag over to his
feet. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Yes," Harry smiled, "Ready when you are." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny hoisted her deep red bag over her shoulder and nodded. He did the
same and disappeared with an audible crack. Ginny closed her eyes and felt
the familiar spinning sensation that felt like she was caught up in a
tornado. Her body was being pulled up and then sucked down, and when she
opened her eyes after hearing a pop she saw that she had appeared at the
Burrow, (namely her room). <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny plopped down on her bed and sighed. She was so tired. She thought a
little nap couldn't hurt, but then she realized something--silence. No one
was in the bathroom. Ginny jumped up and ran to the small room that was
across the hall. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>'A warm shower, that's what I need,' Ginny thought as she turned one of the
rusting knobs until it reached P for 'Pleasantly Hot.' Ginny tossed her
muggle clothes into the laundry chute and entered the stall, just letting
the warm water cascade over her body. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Slowly and gently washing her hair, she could feel the soft soap suds
between her fingers and follicles. She rinsed it out and felt it wash down
her back. She grabbed the shower puff and put her body wash on, rubbing her
hands in it to get the soap to foam. Suddenly the whole bathroom smelled of
soft, ocean air. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>After her lovely shower, she departed (may want to use the words vacate or
got out of) from the tub only to realize she had forgotten to bring her
clothes. Ginny wrapped her hair in a towel and then grabbed a very fluffy,
pink one to wrap around her body. But she soon found out that it was really
small; shorter than most of her shorts and skirts. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny slowly opened the door, peaking outside to check if the coast was
clear. A cool bust of air hit her wet body as she slowly walked away from
the door and started to make her way to her room-- <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Ginny?" Harry yelled. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny spun around to see Harry standing not ten feet away, with an
embarrassed, yet amused, smirk on his face. "Yes?" she said as though he
were talking to her at the dinner table. She was trying her best to ignore
her red face. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Your mum said that its almost lunchtime."
Harry walked past her and said, "Lookin' good, Weasley." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Why Professor Potter, are you goin' gimme points for that?" she said in an
imitation of Sara and Beth's voices. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry laughed and continued walking down the hall. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>The week passed with everyone getting more and more into the Christmas
spirit. Ginny found herself on the sofa in front of the living room fire,
sipping hot cocoa and reading a good book for most of the break. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>It was usually loud with all her family there. Bill was getting ready for
his wedding with Fleur, and Charlie went to see all the Quidditch games
possible with Fred and George. Ron was looking for an apartment to move
into this summer with Harry, who apparently was only planning on teaching
one year at Hogwarts before starting his Auror training. Hermione was out,
already working for the Daily Prophet and also planning to do Auror
training in the fall. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny found herself, once again, on the last page of a horror novel. Sure
it was Christmas, but a nice scare would put her into the right Yuletide
spirit! As she read down to the middle of the page, she heard something
behind her. Ginny pulled the book closer to her face, holding onto the text
for dear life. The last sentence was coming up--the conclusion where they
would take the mask off to see who commited all those murders and stalked
all those people-- "Boo!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned around and clutched her heart. "Don't scare me like that!" Her
voice was shaking and her heart was going so fast that she thought it might
break out of her chest. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Sorry, it just seemed like the perfect opportunity." Harry smiled. Ginny
could have sworn that her heart went just a little faster. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny swung her legs off the sofa and marched toward the stairs. "Ginny,"
Harry said. She could tell he had a smile on his face. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny slowly turned to Harry, who was standing in front of the huge, overly
decorated Christmas tree. Form the position they were standing in, it
looked like the big, old, golden star that resided on top of the tree was
now on Harry's head, much like a hat. "Yes," she said while holding back a
laugh. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What are you doing?" He took a small step forward. Now it looked like a
single point was sticking from the top of his head and several others were
sticking out from the sides. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I'm going to grab another book, I finished this one." Ginny forced back a
grin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Well, sorry, but I have to stop you," Harry grinned and walked closer,
leaving less that 5 feet between them. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What do you mean?" Ginny asked, preparing to take a step back. Harry
pointed up to something above her head. Ginny stared at him for a moment
before looking up. There it was, the bane in her existence...mistletoe. She
glared at it as if it was insulting her freckles or something, the little
green leaves attached to the round, red berries. 'Is that even REAL
mistletoe?' she asked herself, not really looking for an answer. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You know, Gin, its tradition." Harry took a step forward, smiling. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"But--" Ginny tried to protest. What would happen if her and Harry, student
and teacher, started kissing, and the mistletoe decided to wander off to
some other unlucky people, and her brothers popped in? Or worse, her
parents? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"I don't want to get bad luck for such a trivial Christmas tradition,
Ginny." Harry was so close he could have hugged her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You're my teacher," she whispered. She didn't look at him, but in the
opposite direction of the greenery above her, to her toes in the soft, shag
yarn of the rug. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Just at school," he put a hand on her elbow in a comforting manner, "At
school I'm your professor. Here, at the Burrow, we are just Ginny and Harry
joining in on the Christmas spirit." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny suddenly wasn't feeling very Christmas-y. Harry smiled at her; he
knew she really wanted to kiss him, but the haunting feeling of being
caught frightened and excited her all at the same time. And not to mention
that he was considered her elder, her mentor, her role model at school.
'Well, we will be working on a new lesson today,' she said, smiling to
herself. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry grinned and began to lean in, his breath once again on her face, warm
and low. He brought a hand up to her cheek and pulled her gently toward his
own and let his lips lightly touch hers. He pushed a little harder, making
it a real kiss and not just two pairs of lips touching sort- of-thing. He
was about to make the kiss a little French when she pushed him away. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"YOU!" Ginny pointed at him, "It was you! Wasn't it?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry smiled. "Aw, you remembered my kiss, Gin," Harry said, showing her
his sweet, cocky grin. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Do you know how many people could have caught us?" She wasn't shouting
loud enough for the whole house to hear, but she still had the angry tone. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Nobody could have recognized me. You were less that 2 feet away from me
the whole night and you didn't realize it was me," Harry pointed out. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny turned away for a minute, "Why didn't you tell me who you were?"
Ginny looked at him, her soft brown eyes looking betrayed. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"Like you said, we could have gotten caught. I was calling you Ginny the
whole night. If I kissed you and said 'I'm Harry, you know, your
Professor,' someone would have put two and two together." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny shrugged in agreement, not looking at him, but keeping her face to
the side. She suddenly smiled and slowly turned back to him, "You said you
had a crush on me," she said slyly. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry blushed, "S-so I did." He looked away for a second and then laughed.
"Does this mean you're not mad at me?" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Ginny walked back over to him, in the same place she was when they kissed.
"I wasn't mad at you, just hurt." She backed up but Harry's arms pulled her
back, and instead of kissing her, he hugged her. Ginny felt that she would
float away if it weren't for his arms anchoring her. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Reality hit again, and she pushed him away. "Harry, we can't start
anything!" <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"What do you mean?" This time Harry looked hurt. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>"You're my teacher, how would we hide it? I am not having 100 detentions on
my record, I'd never get to be an Auror." Ginny walked up the stairs. "Just
give me a while." <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Harry walked to the foot of the stairs and rested a hand on the banister.
"Ginny?" he called. She turned around and smiled to him, then continued on
her way. <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>~~~ <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>***Thanks to Ashley for beta-ing this chapter as well(!!!!!!***<p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Next Chapter: Christmas is not quite over, back at school and what happens
when Ginny stops by Harry's office just as someone else wants too?? <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Thank you to everyone!! For all your reviews! Thank you to: <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>midnight fenix- Thank you so much! That really means a lot to me! Good Luck
on yours! Can't wait to read it! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Just a Girl , Jade Stellar , Hallie- Thank you! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Josh Potter- Thank you! I will work harder on my details, I hope this one
is a good start in the adding details, sorry this one is so short! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Mysty , Lillianne - I hope you like this half of Christmas. I'm so happy
you like the friends. I really had fun developing their characters before I
started writing, I think I wouldn't mind using them again in another fic:) <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Carmine007- OMG! *takes box of wheat thins* I feel so honors to receive
this from Carmine007, I LOVE YOU TOO!! Thank you so much, you make me feel
like a million dollars!!! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>rad- Thank you so much, I hope you enjoyed it. I admit it isn't not as big
as I said it was, because someone already guessed it...But, I hope it was
still a shock! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>everpresent: Thank you for giving me just what I needed. I just want to
explain that I know she is different in the 5 book, she has a boyfriend.
This happened to me: I had a huge crush on Guy A, I got a boyfriend Guy B,
I was able to talk to Guy A because Guy B made me confident, Guy B and I
broke up, then, all of a sudden, I found that I still had a crush on Guy A,
and I could barely form two words around him. Thank you so much, I'll try
to make it more clear in the following chapters on how her character is.
Oh, thank you about the Colin mistake, I'll fix it right away! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>Grip of Chaos- Your so sweet *Puts watch safely in pocket* Thank you! <p class="calibre5"> </p><p class="calibre3"> </p>A/N: Ok, I realized that the fic is almost done, since I am shooting out 3
chapters a day, I wouldn't be surprised if I finish it this week. Now,
after this, school starts again, and I have play rehearsal after school so
I won't be able to write much more, but I will.
