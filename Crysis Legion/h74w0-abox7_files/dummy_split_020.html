<p class="calibre16">I follow Barclay into a service elevator. We go down.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Your friend,” he remarks, “is full of shit.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I haven’t said a word all day. Right now it seems especially important to nod.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“He says he ‘escaped in the chaos.’ From Tara Strickland. I know Strickland, she was a decorated Navy SEAL before she went off the rails. You don’t just ‘escape’ from that woman. I figure she cut him loose.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The cage jerks to a halt. The doors creak open.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“The question is, why?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I follow Barclay into an observation gallery; it’s obviously been a dingy sub-basement hole for decades, but I’m guessing the shattered windowpanes are a recent development. We stand on a carpet of broken glass and look down on one of the loading platforms. Civilians crowd nervously beside a chain of subway cars. A dozen marines stand by just in case, but this crowd looks about as violent as a yard full of field mice.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Of course, that could all change in a split second if Squiddie crashed the party. I’ve seen little old ladies throw babies to the wolves when their lives were threatened.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Look at these people,” Barclay says, and I’m not even sure he’s talking to me. “I grew up in this town. Any one of them <a class="calibre21"></a>down there could be family. And if it boils down here like it did at Ling Shan …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He shakes his head, pushes through a slatted door at the far end of the gallery. We pass into some kind of control room from the last century. A pendant light hangs from the center of the ceiling, a rusted metal cone with a bare bulb shining from its center. A bank of ancient CRTs glows on one wall, serving up securicam images from around the station. Two grunts sit at an antique command console stretching the length of the room, all buttons and manual switches and actual hardwired <em class="calibre7">lightbulbs</em> embedded in painted schematics of the New York subway system. One of them slaps the board: “Goddamn it, <em class="calibre7">nothing</em> works in this place.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can sympathize. I thought this place was supposed to be brand new—it’s only been, what, eight years since Black Tuesday? And only five since they finished rebuilding the station. But the tech down here is one step away from smoke signals and tin-can telephones. Obviously the reconstruction wasn’t the grand and glorious megaproject they led us to believe; looks to me like they just rebuilt from the ground up. These sublevels have to be left over from the original.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“—was at Ling Shan, you know,” Barclay’s saying. “I saw Strickland—Tara’s father—I saw him die. When Tara heard she just … cracked. Drink, drugs, a string of—unwise command decisions. Dishonorable discharge. And now she’s queen bee at CELL, probably getting five times her old salary. Her father must be turning in his—”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">Boom</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Dust drizzles from the ceiling. The overlight swings back and forth on its wire; the room fills with stretching swooping shadows.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">“Shit …,”</em> someone breathes. Something with claws and cannons lurches across one of the CRTs.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“They’re breaching the main hall, sir.”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Barclay clicks into overdrive: “Martinez, get down on the platforms and tell Dickerson to roll the first train out. Our clock just stopped.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He turns to me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Stations, son. Main hall. Get up there and buy these people some time.”</p>
<p class="calibre27">I get. Squiddie’s running rampant by the time I get back upstairs. Grunts and Heavies stomp across the floor, shattering marble and mowing down Barclay’s men like wheat. Stalkers scramble along the walls and ceiling, gigantic steel roaches, leaping on the unfit and tearing them limb from limb. There are sandbag barricades everywhere—<em class="calibre7">sandbags</em>, Roger, can you fucking believe it?—and the guys who take cover behind them do seem to be a bit better at staying alive but it’s not because a few burlap sacks full of dirt can stop a Ceph shell worth shit. It’s just that the Ceph haven’t noticed them yet.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Doesn’t take long for that to change, though.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Word from behind: The last of the wounded are out of the mezzanine. We fall back, regroup at the choke points on the stairs, hold fast a bit longer as the trains start to pull out of the tunnels below us. I’m asking myself, Barclay knows about the underground hives, right? He knows which lines are still intact and which ones have been ripped in half, these trains aren’t going to barrel off into midair and plunge down into one of those brand-spanking-new rifts that are all the rage these days? And I tell myself not to be an asshole, of <em class="calibre7">course</em> they know, just do your fucking job and stop second-guessing the chain of command. But then I keep not running out of ammo, I keep picking up new clips and new scopes and preowned BFGs that hardly even got fired before the Ceph turned their owners into bloody blobs, and maybe I <em class="calibre7">should</em> be wondering about whatever tactical <a class="calibre21"></a>genius decided the best resupply strategy was to hope that those few miserable assholes still standing after five minutes have lots of bodies to scavenge.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We fall back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We fall back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We fall back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Most of us have been left behind, by now: on the stairs, in the hall, in pieces. But they bought us the time we needed; we few survivors are at the north end of the loading platform now and there’s not a civilian in sight. Squiddie’s pressing hard on our ass but down there at the end of the platform there’s one last train waiting, already half full, our names on the empty seats. Barclay’s back at my side, fighting with the rest of us, and he’s even more exhausted but he’s not scared anymore. He even sends me a smile, not much, just a half-second curl at the corner of his mouth that says <em class="calibre7">We did it, son, we saved the civvies</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I smile back, although of course he can’t see it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then the ceiling crashes in.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe it’s Ceph artillery. Maybe the place has just taken as much abuse as it can, and something gave way. But suddenly there’s rock and rebar and concrete everywhere, and anyone who still needs to, you know, <em class="calibre7">breathe</em> is coughing up dust and grit out of their lungs, and the viz is down to about three meters of pea soup. Barclay’s shouting “Move out, <em class="calibre7">move out you assholes</em>, don’t wait for us!” and I’m guessing that’s the first order in a long time that anyone on that train actually <em class="calibre7">wants</em> to obey and there it goes, our lifeline, our ticket home, our reprieve for the days or hours or ten fucking minutes until the <em class="calibre7">next</em> assault drops us right back into another no-win scenario.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And behind us, out of the murk, I hear things scuttling and clattering and climbing over all the bodies we left behind.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<p class="calibre16"><a class="calibre21"></a>I don’t know how many of us are left. Eight or nine, maybe. Barclay, me, a handful of grunts I’ve never been formally introduced to. One of them remembers that there’s a couple of jeeps parked upstairs in the main hall, if the Ceph haven’t smashed them to shit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">All we have to do is waltz back up there and get them.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Sounds like a piss-poor idea to me. I’d rather take my chances in the subway tunnel. It’s a safe retreat—or at least if it isn’t, the higher-ups have their heads up their asses and we’ve just fed a thousand civilians to Squiddie—and we’d only be fighting rearguard, not wading back into a Ceph stronghold. But Barclay’s leading this charge, and he’s leading it back upstairs. Maybe he knows something I don’t. Hope so. He doesn’t strike me as an idiot. It’d be a drag to be disillusioned after knowing the man for all of an hour.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We lose another one going back up the stairs: Private First Class Andrea Gamji, her midsection shredded by enemy fire. I’m the last thing she ever sees; one second she’s staring up into this goddamn faceplate and the next she’s just <em class="calibre7">gone</em>, nothing at all left behind these dull frosted things she used to look out from. I rob her body and try to think of her as one of the lucky ones, keep my head down and dodge the incoming.</p>
<p class="calibre20">For about thirty seconds it goes better than I’d hoped. The hall isn’t swarming; the handful of Ceph in evidence seem to be mopping up, not digging in. Now that the backbones have buggered off, they aren’t all that interested in the territory.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They don’t seem to be expecting us. We take out two stalkers, three grunts, and a Heavy without losing a man. We don’t get cocky, though; the losses from Round One are scattered everywhere. Some of them are still moving.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Sure enough there’s a Bulldog parked just outside, visible through one of the holes blasted in the wall. Barclay details a couple of bodies to start it up and back it in, a couple more to check <a class="calibre21"></a>out the wounded, and radios for chopper evac. The rest of us exchange gunfire with the Ceph, and I can’t stop thinking about how <em class="calibre7">thin</em> their ranks are up here. These fuckers swarmed our position like fire ants not thirty minutes ago. Where are they now?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Easy answer: They’ve backed off to a safe distance to give their heavy guns a free hand to mop us up.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It comes through one of those three-story windows in the south wall, you know the ones where the glass sits behind a grid of iron bars. It tears through that mesh like it was tissue paper, jumps into the hall in a blizzard of glass, crashes down like some kind of red-eyed three-legged cyclops scanning for prey. Even inside the suit, my eardrums bleed from the sound.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I think: <em class="calibre7">You again</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Through the ringing in my ears I can hear the Bulldog cough, start up, choke. I hear faint tinny curses from We Who Are About to Die. I give silent thanks once again to PFC Andrea Gamji, who bequeathed unto me the only weapon I know of that can take this fucker down.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I am Golem Boy, zombie, giant killer. I bring up the JAW and I pray to Allah that I can only die once.</p>
<p class="calibre27">There are details you know already: the body count. The men Barclay got out, the men he had to leave behind. You know that his call for chopper evac was turned down flat—too much traffic in Midtown during rush hour, I guess—or if you don’t know you fucking well should.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There are details you don’t need to know, details you don’t have any <em class="calibre7">right</em> to know. I’m not going to tell you what a certain squad member told me before I put a bullet in his brain. I’m not going to tell you what his squadmate told me afterward. Pray to whatever imaginary friends you worship that you never have to find out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I will tell you it wasn’t the pinger that nearly did us in. It wasn’t <a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">just</em> the pinger. It was also the Ceph dropship that kept shooting at us through the roof; fucker zipped around like a moth on uppers, it was almost impossible to hit. But the N2 isn’t exactly dog food, either, you know. I dip, I weave. I jump wreckage and piled corpses with a single bound. Somewhere in that shitstorm the pinger goes down in a gout of red fire and I don’t even get to do a victory lap because that alien motherfucker up above the skylight is still raining glass and hollow-points down on the zone.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t take it out, not directly. I wing it, though, knock it off-kilter, send it skidding sideways into the MetLife Building; and MetLife finishes the job. The ship goes up like the Pickering reactor, it’s a beautiful sight, Roger, a glorious sight, but even that doesn’t last because now the whole damn skyscraper’s leaning over in the wake of the blowout, leaning down over the station, and it’s really damn lucky that Barclay’s Banditos finally got that truck running because we barely make the running jump onto the tailboards, barely grab the last bus out of town before MetLife just <em class="calibre7">tips over</em> onto Central and buries it in glass and steel and concrete. Down for the count, for the second time in eight years.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So now we’re flooring it down East 43rd and Central’s just a pile of dust and debris in the rearview. I can hear Barclay down in the cab talking to Dispatch; the local airspace is too hot for traffic but they can probably set a VTOL or two down in Times Square so that’s where we’re headed. But I barely hear that over the other voice in my head, this giddy hysterical voice saying <em class="calibre7">We made it out we made it out we made it out</em>. I don’t know how many times <em class="calibre7">that</em> cycles before <em class="calibre7">another</em> little voice cuts it off with: <em class="calibre7">Whaddya mean, WE?</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">And that’s the first time I notice. Barclay. The driver. Me. We’re the only ones on board.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Nobody else made it.</p>
<p class="calibre33"><img alt="" src="images/00004.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<p class="calibre16"><a class="calibre21"></a>They give us twenty minutes to get to evac before the VTOLs withdraw. We pick up a few stragglers on the way—a couple of battered jeeps with even more battered-looking grunts inside, the remains of an airborne battalion on West 43rd, pinned down by angry Ceph and feeling very damn lucky we happened by to lend a hand. By the time we run into the wreckage piled across West 43rd it’s just this side of midnight, and raining. We ditch the vehicles and crawl through the wall of debris on foot.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’ve never been to Times Square before. Supposed to be the heart of the City That Never Sleeps, right?</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not sleeping now.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The traditional line of cabs is still there, although by now most of them are smoldering shells. Half the surrounding buildings have been skinned in patches, five stories of façade ripped off halfway up one tower, a big smoking hole punched into the top of another. An abandoned NYPD van has taken out the front of the Hard Rock Café, a fire engine’s plowed into a USAF recruiting office (not that there’d’ve been anyone lining up to enlist anyway). I have to laugh; even this deep in Armageddon the billboards and marquees are still lit up, scrolling down, ticking along: <span><span class="calibre9">DOUBLE TEAM YOUR TASTE BUDS. BROOKLYN BRIDGE: MILITARY TRAFFIC ONLY. THIS APOCALYPSE BROUGHT TO YOU BY NIKE</span></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The only other sources of light are the lines of halogen floods glaring down from the big prefab barricades that wall the square off from the rest of Manhattan. The cookie-cutters have been especially busy here: Every side street’s been sealed off, every avenue blocked by ten-meter walls of interlocked blast-hardened concrete, flat and featureless except for an occasional reinforced hatch to let in the refugees. The barriers even extend <em class="calibre7">inside</em> the perimeter, an extra layer of protection between the square at large and the actual evac site at the north end. Like the fortified keep inside a castle, or a cross section of a giant two-chambered fish heart scaled at ten thousand to one.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>We make our way through the ventricle: sandbag revetments, blast shields, pillboxes installed along strategic lines of sight. Voices and VTOL sounds drift over the top of the inner wall. Barclay leads me through into the keep and I’m pleased to see that as his official escort, I’m exempt from being threatened by my own side. Over on the other side the VTOL is spinning up, its belly full of civilians pathetically happy at the prospect of dying somewhere else. The ones left behind jostle and cry and push against a line of marines ringing the load zone. The civilians beg to be taken away; the soldiers make promises and deliver warnings and hope like hell the refugees don’t realize how easy it is for a mob to swarm a single-file perimeter.</p>
<p class="calibre20">That’s about the time the Ceph breach from 42nd and Broadway.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Nothing’s linear after that. Everything happens at once: I’m back outside the keep, forming up ranks with a bunch of Echo-Fivers who must’ve drawn short straws. We man our pillboxes and bring our guns to bear and light up everything down the avenue that walks or squirms. The floodlights at our backs pin the slugs in bright white circles while the Ceph shoot out their reflectors one by one. At least I don’t have to scavenge the bodies of dead comrades for ammo; there are caches stashed everywhere and it’s even raining down from on high, clips and belts and RPGs delivered by human chains over the top of the inner wall. And all the while the VTOLs come and go, drop down empty at our backs and lift off wallowing and straining against the weight of too much loaded meat. Most of the time those cattle cars disappear over the skyline; sometimes they just crash into it, spewing smoke and fire and burning bodies. Barclay’s shouting simultaneous orders in ten different directions. Somehow he manages to keep the fog of war from closing in completely.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Some panicked teenager shouts into his mike with a voice that cracks midsentence, then goes dark: heavy assault units crawling <a class="calibre21"></a>up Broadway. The perimeter is long since breached but so far the walls themselves are holding. That’s something. Not enough, not for long: One Ceph gunship comes down over the keep and it’s a slaughterhouse back there.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A Pinger steps in from stage left and rattles the rooftops. The lights go out. I mean <em class="calibre7">everything:</em> The floodlights on the barricade. The ABC news ticker down the street. The Hard Rock Café. Nike. BMG, Viacom, Planet Hollywood: all dark, all dark.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Madison Avenue has fallen.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We fall back, too. Barclay’s orders.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The ground’s shaking under my feet when I hit the northern hatch. I risk a look over my shoulder but the pinger’s still advancing, not crouched down the way it does when it shits out one of those sonic blasts. I get back through the barrier in time to see a VTOL stagger up into the sky. I look around, do a double take: The place looks downright empty.</p>
<p class="calibre20">No civilians. No lights. The ground shakes again. Someone comms down from the battlements: For some reason the Ceph are pulling out. So are we. The latest incoming VTOL radios in for an update, and Barclay himself lays it down: “Cyclops Four, you’ll be the last—going to be cramped but we’ll get everyone out this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can hear our getaway softly slashing air in the distance; it drifts into view over the ramparts as I watch. But the tremors haven’t stopped. In fact, they’re getting worse.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay notices: “Cyclops Four, be advised we have unstable—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I guess he hasn’t been here before.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The ground bucks underneath us; the asphalt splits down Seventh like someone unzipping a duffel bag. A few of the guys yell <em class="calibre7">incoming!</em> and look around for airborne bogeys but they’re looking in exactly the wrong direction. The spire ruptures the center of the compound and punches into the air like a giant fist; electric auroras writhe along its sides. Humvees, blacktop, shattered sewer <a class="calibre21"></a>pipes—that whole thin crust of shit we call <em class="calibre7">civilization</em>—tumble and bounce down its flanks. A jeep flips over and nearly squashes a medic. Cyclops Four rears back, slews to starboard, skids back out of sight like a toy thrown by some spoiled and angry child.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I wait for the impact. It doesn’t come. The spire grinds to a halt, steaming.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Cyclops Four, this is Barclay, can you still land? We are evac-ready, repeat we—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Colonel Barclay, I really must advise you against that.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Nobody speaks for a moment. The spire towers over us like a great twisted backbone: dull orange embers glow in twisted bands along its length. Volcanic DNA.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Who the hell are you?” Barclay says at last.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Jack Hargreave. Colonel, there isn’t—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“This is a military channel.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“—really time for introductions. You and all your men—”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">“Get off this channel, Hargreave.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">“I would love to comply, Colonel, believe me. I have my own problems at the moment and I have no time for this bullshit, but I <em class="calibre7">promise</em> that if you let that chopper continue its approach you will be killing everyone aboard. Not to mention whatever remnants of your command remain on the ground. That thing has <em class="calibre7">reflexes</em>. You must deal with it first.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay has delivered no commands to Cyclops Four but I can’t help noticing that the sound of those engines seems to have faded a bit into the distance; someone up there is taking Hargreave seriously even if Barclay doesn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But Barclay does, eventually. He stands there with his hands wrapped around the grip of his Majestic and you just <em class="calibre7">know</em> he wishes it was Hargreave’s neck. But when he goes back on the air, it’s only to say “Cyclops Four. Back off. Return to operational height.”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Barclay waits until the sound of the rotors fades away, never taking his eyes off the spire smoldering in our midst. He tweaks his mike. He speaks with slow, deliberate calm.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“So what, exactly, does our resident self-appointed expert suggest?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“The spires are essentially an area-denial bioweapon,” Hargreave tells him. “Their current iteration seems designed to render a given area safe for alien habitation.” (A twitch at the edge of Barclay’s mouth: point to Nathan Gould.) “They have a baseline activation cycle for routine operations, but they accelerate that process in response to incursions of—well, of pests. Once the spire is up and running, it perceives the approach of any incompatible biosignature as an increased threat, and will discharge preemptively—at the cost of overall coverage, but even premature, er, ejaculation would be more than enough to infect all of your men.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Recommendations.” Barclay’s voice would freeze beer in the keg.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You must neutralize the spire, of course.” Hargreave pauses like a stand-up comic timing a punch line. “Fortunately, I’ve provided you with the means to do just that.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Suddenly everyone’s looking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre27">I’ve been here before. Last time it didn’t end so well.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave is all about climbing the spire and getting in from the top. Fuck that: <em class="calibre7">I’m</em> all about not getting shot out of that thing like a spitball if Hargreave’s hack goes south again, and that means having an escape hatch right down here at ground level. What’s really odd is that I <em class="calibre7">find</em> one. I circle the base of the thing, climb across torn-up pavement and plumbing, and of course there’s nothing familiar about it at all. It’s <em class="calibre7">alien</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>And yet not, somehow …</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s a segment just a little off-kilter from the others, a slipped disk, a fused vertebra: whatever you want to call it. Most people wouldn’t even notice it; someone with an eagle eye might see a slight flaw in mass-production, a cosmetic glitch. I look at it and a familiar voice whispers, <em class="calibre7">Access panel</em>. I wait a bit but it doesn’t tell me anything else: not <em class="calibre7">combination lock</em> or <em class="calibre7">key code</em> or <em class="calibre7">press and turn</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So I blast it open with a sticky grenade.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A stiff breeze tugs at me from the hole: pressure gradient, just like before. I bet these things are pneumatic, I bet they suck in a huge long breath to build up the pressure for the Great Spore Pukefest. Which means we’ve got time as long as it’s still inhaling.</p>
<p class="calibre20">When it stops, boys, head for the hills.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Inside it’s the same layout: the silo, the curved panels, the seething currents of spore. The same virtual vulture sitting on my shoulder, reminding me how little time I have, how vital it is that I <em class="calibre7">compromise the settings for spore dispersal</em>, how it’s <em class="calibre7">so much more likely to work this time</em>. I wonder about the hole I’ve just blown in the side of this thing—an open door between the spore in here and all that unprotected meat outside—but the pressure differential should keep everything contained. Assuming it lasts.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Besides, it’s not as though the whole area <em class="calibre7">won’t</em> be rotten with spore if I just stand back and do nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So: the same smash and grab, the same blood-chilling cries from an alien machine in pain. The same dark blizzard of uncontained spore swirling around me, cutting my viz to zero, clinging to the surface of the Nanosuit like a billion antique keys in search of microscopic keyholes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The same static discharge. The same tactical countdown:</p>

The air <em class="calibre7">hums</em> around me; it’s coming from the suit, it’s the sound of a cascade, of a million tiny voices learning a new song and teaching a billion others, of a billion teaching a trillion. It’s the sound of mimetic fission.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s the sound of a process that sucks power like New York on New Year’s. It’s the sound of an alarm going off in my head, red icons blooming across my sightscape, energy levels dropping like bricks off a cliff.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’ve got to get out of here.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I duck down and fall through the hatch; hungry spores swarm after me like a comet’s tail, like a cloud of hungry mites. I try to stand; it’s <em class="calibre7">hard</em>, it’s almost impossible, it’s like being human again. I stagger against my own weight. Voices spill into my head: groundhogs and chopper jockeys talking over each other. Hargreave. Barclay. My name, over and over. <em class="calibre7">Alcatraz. No</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I fall onto broken pavement, stare up at the sky. Cyclops Four is up there, fully loaded, dwindling.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something else leans in, much closer. Its eyespots glow like suns. It picks me up as if I weigh nothing at all.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not alone. The compound’s swarming with Ceph.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The spire detonates.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The cloud erupting from the top of that thing doesn’t look like anything I’ve ever seen. It glistens, it <em class="calibre7">sparkles:</em> It’s just nanites talking to each other, spreading the gospel according to Hargreave <a class="calibre21"></a>all along the visible spectrum, but I don’t find that out until later. Right now it just looks as though an evil cancerous monstrosity has vomited a whole galaxy of stars into the sky, and it’s so beautiful I forget for a moment that I’m about to die.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And I think, in that same moment, the Ceph realize they <em class="calibre7">are</em> about to.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The grunt drops me without a second glance and leaps away at top speed; a white tendril swirls down like God’s finger, touches it in flight. The grunt <em class="calibre7">melts</em>, just liquefies in its armor. Its exoskeleton face-plants in a pile of joints and plating, bleeding clear viscous fluid from its seams.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Down the street a stalker scrabbles at the barricade, collapses in a puddle. Half a block farther on a pinger staggers, takes a wobbly step toward me, crouches for attack; but the blast never comes. It doesn’t give up; it draws itself back up to full height and continues its advance, slowly, deliberately, taking care with every step. There’s a kind of desperate dignity to the way it moves; for a second or so I almost feel sorry for it. A shell slams into its side and detonates, knocking it over. Whoops and cheers on comm; I raise my eyes to Heaven and see Cyclops Four coming in for another pass. Her port turbine gouts flames. She slews, wobbles to a stop ten meters ahead, hangs just a couple of meters above the ground and doesn’t dare to settle.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can’t stand. I don’t have the strength. So I crawl, drag myself along the ground like a paraplegic toward that lowering tailgate, toward the shouting voices and waving arms. Something grabs me, hoists me off the ground as the ground begins to fall away. BUD’s charge alert downgrades to yellow; I feel my systems starting to firm up. Cyclops tilts into the sky. Someone passes me a cargo strap: I grab hold and look down across a battlefield of empty machinery, robot bodies dropped and discarded as if the things inside have just been raptured up to Heaven. They haven’t, though; I can see what’s left of them dribbling through <a class="calibre21"></a>the cracks in all those suits of armor, congealing in sticky puddles on the road.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">Explosive catalytic autolysis</em> I think, and somehow I know what that means.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’ve seen bioweapons in my time. I was there when Egypt laid that pimped-out necrotizing fasciitis down on the Syrians, back at the start of the Water Wars: You could see it eat the meat right off the bones in realtime, like it was some kind of Discovery Channel time-lapse. Those poor bastards died in minutes; the wounds actually <em class="calibre7">steamed</em> because the Strepto’s metabolic rate had been cranked so high. They had to retcon a whole new suite of bacterial enzymes just to handle the heat.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Next to this, that was <em class="calibre7">nothing</em>. I’ve never seen <em class="calibre7">anything</em> kill this fast.</p>
<p class="calibre20">If this is what Hargreave’s capable of when his hands are tied, I say let him off the leash and get the hell out of the way.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Colonel Sherman Barclay in <em class="calibre7">two</em> words: Tired.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Scared.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not of death—you don’t wear that many scars without making some kind of peace with mortality—but of failure. Scared because he’s presiding over the end of the world, and whole platoons are looking to him, and what if he isn’t up for it? We’re living through the mother of all doomsday scenarios, you don’t expect to win; but there are so many different ways to lose. Here at the end of his career Sherman Barclay has finally seen it all, and accepted that for him there is nothing left to see; and what he’s been fearing even since the End Days began—what he’s been fearing even more than Squiddie—is a bad death.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But you know what <em class="calibre7">really</em> got him scared, Roger? You know what he <em class="calibre7">really</em> fears, now that he’s just seen a whole platoon of Ceph turn into beef consommé before his eyes? I see it the moment <a class="calibre21"></a>they haul me into the VTOL: I see it in the look on his face as we dust off.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hope.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Because wouldn’t you know it, Gould was right. Barclay knows that now; he doesn’t have to weigh the odds of a wild-ass theory against a cost of human lives anymore, he’s seen the N2 in action. This suit is a certified Ceph-killer, this suit could be the goddamn Black Death of Cephdom if we knew how to fine-tune the damn thing. This suit could turn the whole war around.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What do you do when you’ve finally resigned yourself to your own inevitable extermination, and someone offers you a way out? Any hope in a place like this almost <em class="calibre7">has</em> to be false; all it can do is shake your determination, tempt you with thoughts of <em class="calibre7">after this is over</em> when you should just be thinking about getting the job done <em class="calibre7">now</em>. Hope is distraction, hope is fear undercutting resolve, because hope gives you back that most terrible of battlefield commodities: something to lose.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Colonel Sherman Barclay is trying to decide whether he dares to hope.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Times Square dwindles behind us, a new wave of Ceph moving in to take possession. The Rapture doesn’t seem to be taking them; I guess Hargreave’s turncoat spore is all used up. Too bad he couldn’t have programmed it with a longer life span. Too bad he couldn’t have programmed them to <em class="calibre7">replicate</em>, like any self-respecting doomsday bug. We could’ve just sat back and watched smallpox take out the Europeans for a change.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But no. We now return you to your apocalypse, already in progress.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m not quite as dead as I thought; Hargreave’s hack didn’t actually need <em class="calibre7">that</em> much power but it needed it all at once, and there’s a limit to how many joules-per-second the N2 can give up. It didn’t faint on me because it was losing blood; it fainted because it stood up too fast. Now that it isn’t being suckled by a <a class="calibre21"></a>billion microscopic mouths, its charge level’s almost back in the green.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I could still use a top-up, though, and there’s a couple of outlets right here by the tailgate. I jack in and let the suit feed while Barclay goes forward. Two dozen haggard faces follow him up the aisle. A few others look back at me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A couple of them even smile.</p>
<p class="calibre20">By the time I reach the cockpit myself, Barclay’s deep in argument with a familiar face on the far end of a video link.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“We <em class="calibre7">tried</em> to evacuate,” Gould yells on the screen, “you think we didn’t try? I told you, they <em class="calibre7">swarmed</em> us! Derailed the whole fucking train not halfway to Harlem! Now will you <em class="calibre7">listen to me</em>? We have to go to the Prism! It’s our only hope. If there are any answers, Hargreave will have them. I worked for that fucker half my life, I know him. He’s on top of this for sure. Someone has to go in there and bring him out.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Colonel Barclay does not like civilians. He sure as shit doesn’t like this one, and if anything he likes Hargreave even less. But there it is again, whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hope.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So he clenches his jaw, and takes a deep breath, and nods. He tells the pilot to change course for Prism.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The pilot laughs aloud. “Not a chance, sir. We took a lot of damage back there, I got multiple ruptures to the fuel lines, the pods, too—we’re bleeding fuel like a stuck pig.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“How close can you get us?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">A couple of seconds, a quick backbrain calculation. “South end of the island. Maybe.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Do it.” Barclay turns to me as we bank to port. “Look at them,” he says.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I do: burns, bullet wounds, thousand-yard stares. Half these people should be in therapeutic coma. The rest should be dead.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You’re it,” Barclay says.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>And you know something, Roger? It’s just as well.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m sick of wading through infernos wearing this superskin while other soldiers, <em class="calibre7">better</em> soldiers probably, burn like moths on all sides. I’m alone in here no matter how many people they send along for the ride.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“We can meet you on the other side,” Barclay continues. “Cover your exit. We’ve got good men and women on that train, they’re shepherding the civilians to safety. I’ll send a squad to meet you and Hargreave at the Queensboro Bridge.” His shoulders rise, fall; I can’t hear the sigh over the sound of the engine. “I’ll send Gould along, too. I suppose the man might have some—helpful insights.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something beeps and flashes red on the dash. “That’s it,” the pilot says. “We don’t drop him here, we don’t get home. I’ll go low as I can, but we’re down to fumes.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Back down to the tail. Barclay’s ahead of me, slaps a button: the tailgate folds down like a drawbridge in front of me. Streamers of fire dance in and out of view to my left, blown back from the burning engine.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Good luck, marine. Watch your ass.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The East River rolls by a few meters below—black and oily in visible, a deep peaceful blue on thermal—and for a second I think it’s taking heavy fire. But no: Those are only raindrops.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The VTOL’s already banking back to shore by the time I jump.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I hit the surface straight vertical, perfect entry. The river closes over my head with barely a splash. Dead of night, pitch-black water, viz so low I can’t even see my own hand unless I push it right up against the helmet, and you know what?—</p>
<p class="calibre20">It doesn’t bother me a bit. No sign of the fear that’s plagued me ever since I was eight years old. Not a <em class="calibre7">twinge</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe I’m just getting used to it. Or maybe it’s a fringe benefit, courtesy of SECOND and the N2.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>For a second that almost scares me more than water used to. Because I’ve been inside this beast for, what—twelve hours, now? Fifteen? And if it’s already got its tentacles buried so deep that it can edit out my <em class="calibre7">phobias</em>, what the hell will it have done after a day or two? After a week? I mean, what <em class="calibre7">are</em> we, what makes us unique, if not for our own personal fears and quirks? What if some mission algorithm decides that my personality’s an operational liability? How many more of these background edits does it take before I don’t wake up tomorrow, before something <em class="calibre7">else</em> wakes up that just happens to have my memories?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m not used to being such an existentialist wanker, you know. But all of this passes through my mind in the two seconds between the time I hit the water and the time I stop sinking. I hang there in that muddy black current for just a moment. Physics weighs buoyancy and momentum and gravity, and as I start to rise the dread just—drains out of me, somehow. The thoughts remain, that scary conclusion is still front and center, but it’s colorless. I can look at the prospect of being edited out of my own head and it really should scare the shit out of me, but it doesn’t anymore. I’m not even scared by the obvious reason <em class="calibre7">why</em> it doesn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Because after all, I’ve got a mission to complete. And by the time I break the surface—ten, twelve seconds after splashdown—that’s really all I’m focused on.</p>
