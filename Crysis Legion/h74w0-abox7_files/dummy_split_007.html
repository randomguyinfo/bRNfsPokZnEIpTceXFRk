</div><div class="calibre19"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">Laurence Barnes, I think. Prophet.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Alcatraz, then. Whatever. It doesn’t matter. Of <em class="calibre7">course</em> I know the stats: I’m dead, not senile. Name, rank, serial number. Doesn’t mean shit. That’s not who I am anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m the guy being debriefed by a low-level functionary because his bosses are too chickenshit to risk being in the same room, that’s who. You expect me to think you <em class="calibre7">volunteered</em> for this gig? You think the higher-ups <em class="calibre7">wanted</em> to bring you into the loop, you think they wouldn’t be in here themselves if they weren’t afraid I might go off the reservation again given half a chance?</p>
<p class="calibre20">You’re lying.</p>
<p class="calibre20">No, that’s an empirical fact. Your skin conductivity just went up 13 percent. Your eye saccades increased by 24. And you don’t want to get into your vocal stress harmonics. You may think you sound pretty solid, but believe me: In the upper registers you’re squealing like a little girl.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can tell stuff like that now. It’s not the augments—it’s not <em class="calibre7">just</em> the augments. I’m not reading numbers off a tactical overlay or anything, it’s more—integrated. I just <em class="calibre7">know</em> this shit. I know a lot of things I’m not supposed to.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But you’ve got nothing to worry about. Really. If I had any <a class="calibre21"></a>interest in killing you, you’d have been dead before you got through the door. You must realize that.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Doesn’t help much, does it?</p>
<p class="calibre27">How do you want to do this?</p>
<p class="calibre20">From the top, then: They put us out to sea the moment the media blackout came down. I mean the <em class="calibre7">moment</em>—Chino was watching <em class="calibre7">Body-Swap Boxing</em> when the Emergency Broadcast Signal cut in. One minute after that MacroNet starts talking about some kind of massive explosion in New York, and literally three minutes after <em class="calibre7">that</em> we’re hauling ass down to the water. There’s a Swordfish surfacing off the dock, hasn’t even finished blowing its tanks before we’re piling inside. Haven’t even checked our gear. We are <em class="calibre7">mobilized</em>, man, we’re moving just this side of outright panic and we don’t even know why. They barely get the hatch closed before we’re back underwater.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We strap in. You can hear the screws turning through the hull. The Swordfish is basically a troop carrier with a big drive and a few missile tubes thrown in so it won’t feel like such a pussy around the hunter-seekers, but even a Sword has the usual stealth options so you can get in and out without a fuss. They’re not engaged. Wherever we’re going, apparently we can’t even afford a lousy 6 percent cloaking deficit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Then it’s a classic case of hurry up and wait. For <em class="calibre7">eighteen hours</em>. Nobody tells us shit, and the shit they do tell us keeps changing. First we’re going to be docking with one of those big inflatable jellyfish down in the mesopelagic, keep us safely off the game board until we’re needed. I’m thinking that’s okay, at least there’s decent headroom in those things, at least they’re big enough to let you get away from the—but no, now suddenly we’re heading back inshore. And then we’re circling off Christ-knows-where for fuck-knows-how-long. Some of the guys try to catch a few winks <a class="calibre21"></a>but the CO handed out the usual stims at the six-hour mark so everyone’s boosted on GABA and tricyclics and that supernephrin stuff that makes your joints ache for two fucking weeks post-engagement. I keep a forty of tequila in my kit—you know, strictly for medicinal purposes—and I crack it to take the edge off. Offer it around but nobody else wants any. They say it makes a bad mix with all the neurotropes. Pussies.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Anyway, we’re strapped in, we’re wired, we’re climbing the walls. And suddenly the whine of the screws picks up, the night-lights kick in, and the whole compartment turns bloody red, like one of those Asian necro parlors where they use longwave to make the corpses look prettier. It doesn’t take an AI to figure out we’re deploying to New York but the CO won’t even give up that much. Says we’ll get briefed on-site. So we’re sitting there in our camo, cheek-to-jowl, and everybody’s making up these fairy tales to fill in the gaps. Syntheviral attack, moho nukes tunneling up under Broadway, some kind of coup at CENT-COM. Leavenworth—you know Leavenworth? No, of course you don’t—Leavenworth weighs in with his usual crazy-ass theories, says he heard some Venter Biomorphs went all Skynet and turned on their masters, and he won’t listen to half the squad pointing out that the Venter labs are way the hell over in California and if we’re really heading into the replicant wars don’t you think they might, you know, <em class="calibre7">airlift</em> us instead of taking a submarine through the Northwest fucking Passage?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t think Leavenworth believed that shit half the time himself. I think he just liked yanking our chains. I’m really going to miss him, if I ever get that part of my brain back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Every now and then you can hear chatter drifting back through the forward hatch; turns out there’s at least six other boats deployed, under orders of some Colonel Barclay I’ve never heard of. And yeah, big surprise, we’re all headed up the East River for Upper Manhattan. Except suddenly <em class="calibre7">we</em> aren’t. Suddenly we’re <a class="calibre21"></a>detached from the main group and diverting to Battery Park. Secret rendezvous, CO tells us. Maybe a rescue mission. I don’t know if he’s giving it up or making it up.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So everybody’s making these wild-ass guesses and Chino even starts a <em class="calibre7">pool</em> for chrissake, right there in the sub, and I’m sitting there and all I can think about is—</p>
<p class="calibre20">You know I was afraid of water, right?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I mean, of course I didn’t <em class="calibre7">tell</em> anybody—I worked through it like you’re supposed to, even came in third in the open-water trials last year. It’s not a problem. But I almost drowned back when I was eight. Kinda stuck with me. You <em class="calibre7">must</em> have known. There were all these tests. You must have sniffed it out during the psych workup.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Thought so.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So everybody’s jammed in there with their theories and Chino’s got his pool going, and it’s been eighteen hours now and I’ve been white-knuckling the bench for at least ten of ’em. Parchman figures I’m hungover but all I can think about is: a measly seven centimeters of biosteel between me and the whole Atlantic Ocean and I don’t care how strong they say it is, a bunch of threads squeezed out of some gengineered spider’s ass is not gonna keep an ocean out forever.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Probably the last time I was right about anything in this whole shitstorm.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Finally some voice comes over the comm, tells us it’s time to saddle up. And that’s when we hear a <em class="calibre7">ping</em>—not sonar, not <em class="calibre7">our</em> sonar anyway, just a single, solid beat resonating throughout the hull. Everybody falls silent for just a second, and Behrendt looks around and says, “Anybody hear that?”—</p>
<p class="calibre20">And something kicks us hard in the side.</p>
<p class="calibre20">No alarms, nothing coming over the comm link, just one <em class="calibre7">ping</em> and a giant <em class="calibre7">boom</em> and the whole boat’s rolling to port. We don’t even have time to scream; there’s one microscopic <em class="calibre7">whatthefuck</em>
<a class="calibre21"></a>moment and the hull opens up like some giant took a can opener to us. The far side of the compartment just <em class="calibre7">crumples:</em> snaps Behrendt’s back like a toothpick, turns her into a rag doll right before my eyes, and then a crossbeam or bracket or some fucking thing tears free of the forward bulkhead and squashes Beaudry like a bug.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We’re going down, now—the deck’s at some crazy-ass angle, there’s water flooding in from the bow, the whole damn hull’s groaning like a humpback whale. <em class="calibre7">Now</em> the alarms kick in. Or maybe it’s just everybody screaming. There’s blood everywhere and you’d think it would blend in with the night-vision redlight but it doesn’t, it jumps right out at you, it’s solid shiny black. By now the water’s not even <em class="calibre7">gushing</em> in, it’s <em class="calibre7">rising</em>—like a tide, like a liquid floor sliding up to crush us all against the ceiling. Except the ceiling’s a wall, and the rear bulkhead is the roof, and—</p>
<p class="calibre20">And—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Look, you—you <em class="calibre7">know</em> this shit. The sub went down. Period. Why do you need the details? You’re not making a fucking documentary.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I know, it’s just that—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fine.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So it’s every man for himself. I barely even have a chance to take a breath before the ocean closes over my head and I’m diving down, pushing buddies and body parts out of the way, and I’m fucking <em class="calibre7">scared</em>, man, I can’t see anything except bloody backlight and blue sparks as the electronics short out. The sub’s still groaning around me, it’s crumpling into a paper ball and at least the screams stop underwater but you can hear metal grinding on metal as though it were right inside your fucking head. We get through the forward hatch, it’s still black and blue and red everywhere except there’s this jagged tear off to the side, this blue-black crevice seething with bubbles. I push through. I look up and there’s pale dim light, and I look down and there’s this <a class="calibre21"></a>great dark wall of metal sliding past, gashed to shit and bleeding rivers of air. Somewhere down there the bow’s already hit bottom because there’s a big honking cloud of black mud boiling up from below, engulfing the hull like something live. Like something <em class="calibre7">starving</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And all that matters, in that moment, is that I get to the surface.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s no <em class="calibre7">Semper</em>-fucking-<em class="calibre7">fi</em> down there in the deeps, let me tell you. Maybe if I’d had my rebreather on. Maybe if I’d had more than one lousy lungful of air to get me thirty meters to the surface. Maybe if I wasn’t fighting off flashbacks from fifteen years ago. But no: I don’t try to free the trapped or assist the wounded or carry the unconscious to safety on my back. I don’t even think about it. There are things in my way: Some are sharp and hard and some are soft and gooshy and I don’t fucking <em class="calibre7">care</em>, man, I bull through them all without prejudice or favoritism. I’m an eight-year-old kid again, and I’m <em class="calibre7">dying</em>, and I know what that feels like. Not again. God, not again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So I’m fighting my way to the surface. Didn’t even have the presence of mind to grab a pair of fins, you know, I’m just kicking at the ocean with these stupid little ape feet and all I know is it’s dark in one direction and a little less dark in the other and my chest is so tight it feels like it’s going to burst, like somehow I’ve got a whole roomful of air jammed in there ready to explode. And it almost does, I almost suffer a fucking embolism before I remember that that last gulp of air I took, it was under <em class="calibre7">pressure:</em> the closer I get to the surface the more it expands, the harder it pushes to get out. So I open my mouth. I open my mouth and I vomit all that precious air into the sea and I follow the bubbles as fast as I can, I pray to God the air doesn’t bleed out of me faster than it swells up inside. I’m kicking and clawing at the water and suddenly the light overhead has <em class="calibre7">texture</em> somehow, that dull greenish glow resolves into distinct shafts of light and they’re <a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">dancing</em>, I swear to God they’re dancing. Suddenly there’s a roof over my head, like a writhing mirror, like mercury, and I break through and I feel like I could swallow the whole fucking sky and I’m so glad to be alive, man, you have no idea. I couldn’t care less about Behrendt or Chino or even poor old conspiracy-crackpot Leavenworth. I’m so glad to be alive I don’t even notice the hellscape I’ve dragged myself into—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh, that.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Yeah, I <em class="calibre7">am</em> a bit more eloquent than I used to be. Sometimes. <em class="calibre7">Writhing mirrors</em> and <em class="calibre7">dancing lights</em>. Never used to talk like that before. Now I just, you know. Switch back and forth. Don’t even notice it half the time.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But you know that story, don’t you? Improved vocabulary’s just a side effect. Just another reminder that I’m never alone in here.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What I am, and what I was, and whatever this damn armor thinks it is.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Heh.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We are legion.</p>

<p class="calibre16">I’m born again into dead of night. About a dozen others are on the surface ahead of me, looking around while I’m still frenching the atmosphere. A few more pop up like Whac-A-Moles as I get my bearings. There’s oil everywhere, streams and patches of it mottling the surface.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oil on the water, but it’s the sky that’s on fire.</p>
<p class="calibre20">New York stretches around us like a big dark tumor. Most of the skyline’s blacked out; ten dark buildings for every one or two that still have power. You can still make stuff out, though; a smudge of moonlight through the clouds, and the overcast flickers with something like orange heat lightning. If that’s reflected firelight, whole city blocks must be on fire in there. I can actually see an apartment building burning in the distance; it looks insignificant <a class="calibre21"></a>from out here, like a matchbox crawling with orange fireflies. Closer to the waterfront a whole office tower has just given up and slumped into the next building over. Black oily smoke crawls into the sky from a hundred spots we can’t begin to make out from the waterline but there’s no missing the great dark blanket they feed into, hanging over the skyline: It’s so heavy I wonder why it doesn’t crash down and flatten everything that’s still standing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Holy fuck,” someone says. “What happened here?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Leavenworth. You made it out, man. You made it out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I turn, tracking his voice, but the thing that bobs into view is not Leavenworth, not military, not alive. It barely even looks <em class="calibre7">human</em> anymore; it looks back at me with clumps of pulpy gray tumors where its eyes should be. A network of, of—veins, or tendons, or <em class="calibre7">something</em> like that runs down its cheek and roots in the shoulder, like, like—</p>
<p class="calibre20">You know those big industrial meat grinders in the supermarkets? You feed all the leftover chunks and waste cuts and bits of bone into that hopper at the top and there’s this kind of grille at the bottom where the hamburger oozes out like a twisted cable of limp red worms?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And I see now that the whole harbor’s dotted with these rotted floating things, that half the people I took for brothers-in-arms are dead civilians turned monstrous. So now I’m barely keeping my lunch down and I’m wondering if <em class="calibre7">everyone</em> was right, if it was a syntheviral <em class="calibre7">and</em> a nuclear strike <em class="calibre7">and</em> a coup d’état—hell, why not throw in Leavenworth’s rogue biomorphs while you’re at it? Maybe someone’s launched the mother of all out-and-out assaults, maybe it’s all of those things at once.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Man, what I wouldn’t give now, if that’s all it had been.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And just then someone cries out and I turn to <em class="calibre7">that</em> sound expecting more death and corruption but instead I see a big patch <a class="calibre21"></a>of bubbles boiling on the surface. At first I think it’s the dying breath of the Swordfish, belched up from the bottom of the Hudson; but the water keeps churning and I actually feel a flash of hope that one of the other subs has come to the rescue, that the cavalry’s breaching at our backs. I can see something dark and metallic just under the surface, red light rising from below, although some part of me says in a very small voice it doesn’t look like any conning tower <em class="calibre7">I’ve</em> ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then it rises above the waterline, and it <em class="calibre7">keeps on rising</em> until there’s no water holding it up anymore and it’s <em class="calibre7">still</em> rising, big as a fucking house, it’s got its own personal storm front underneath where the water’s streaming back off its sides. I can’t make out jack shit except for two glowing orange hoops the size of merry-go-rounds and a black shape between them. But it’s pretty obvious that whatever this is, it’s not from anywhere around here.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And even <em class="calibre7">that</em> doesn’t get as much time to sink in as I’d like, because in the next second it clicks on its high beams and starts shooting.</p>
<p class="calibre20">My reflexes kick in. All it takes is the sight of that little line of splashes stitching across the water toward me. You can hear them below the surface, too, rapid-fire <em class="calibre7">thwip-thwip-thwips</em> getting louder, fading away, coming back the moment you break the surface to grab a breath and a gamble. You can’t get a bearing, of course. No time for that. You breach and breathe and catch the quickest glimpse of those lethal little tracers streaking down from somewhere overhead. Maybe you hear someone scream as they lose their own particular throw of the dice but then you’re back under again, hoping you don’t roll snake-eyes before you make shore—because, sure, you’ll be exposed on land but at least you’ve got solid ground under you, right? At least you can <em class="calibre7">run</em> for cover instead of floundering like wounded bait waiting for the sharks.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>You let your brain stem take over, let your muscles decide for themselves when to zig and when to zag. Don’t think about what it <em class="calibre7">is</em>, that’s too big and there’s no time; think about what it’s <em class="calibre7">doing</em>. It’s using <em class="calibre7">ballistics</em>. Not phasers, not death rays. No infallible super-targeting computers, or you’d be dead already. It’s shooting <em class="calibre7">projectiles</em>. It’s spitting out lines of <em class="calibre7">bullets</em>, like it ordered its ammo from Ordnance “R” Us. Conventional weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Of course, conventional weapons do just fine when your target is unarmed hamburger flailing around in open water. I hear the screams between the bullets and the bubbles. I can hear that airborne motherfucker mowing us down like dogs. But I keep rolling the dice, man, I keep breathing and diving and zigging and zagging, and they don’t get me. I make it all the way to the shore. I nearly kill myself on the debris slope, I’m stroking so hard I don’t see the rocks coming and a piece of half-buried driftwood just under the surface nearly takes out my eye but suddenly my feet are on the bottom, the rocks are slimy but they’re <em class="calibre7">solid</em>, and I’m scrambling uphill and I run smack into a sheer concrete seawall. In one split second I realize there’s no <em class="calibre7">way</em> I can scale it without grapplers or gecko gloves, and in the next I’m slipping on the slime and I go over backward as a line of divots explodes across the concrete right about where my head used to be.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m back in the water and those lights in the sky, those glowing eyes are sweeping off across the water in search of other targets. Someone’s yelling off to my left and it’s <em class="calibre7">Leavenworth</em>, man, you just can’t keep him down, we’ve obviously found us a niche where being a paranoid conspiracy freak actually pays off. And Leavenworth is waving and gesturing, something’s blown a hole in the seawall just a few meters along and he’s already diving into that breach and I’m right there behind him. We crawl through a little canyon of smashed concrete and tangled rebar that tries to gut you like a fish every time you move. There’s this stink in the air, not just the oil and the bodies and the shit in the harbor, <a class="calibre21"></a>something else, something—acrid. That’s the word. Like ammonia.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We come out in the middle of something that used to be a road, hunker down under a slab of upended asphalt like kids camping in a lean-to. But the Eyes in the Sky are swinging around for another pass, and they’ve got a clear shot at us from their current angle of approach. Leavenworth breaks cover and starts running for the only other piece of cover in sight, old wreck of a building past fifty meters of parking lot. I’m right behind him, got my eyes on the ground but it doesn’t help, I still see Leavenworth blow apart like a water balloon right in front of me. The ballistics are a fucking <em class="calibre7">hailstorm</em> now and we’ve just been massacred and suddenly there’s this stupid giddy voice in my head that won’t shut up, keeps saying <em class="calibre7">Well at least Leavenworth died happy—vindicated at last, blown up by space aliens …</em> and—</p>
<p class="calibre20">—And then there’s this, this kind of a <em class="calibre7">thump</em>, a <em class="calibre7">tugging</em> sensation, and I’m not running anywhere anymore. I can’t feel my legs. I’m facedown in gravel and there’s blood everywhere, it’s got to be mine because I can <em class="calibre7">feel</em> myself bleeding out, but—</p>
<p class="calibre20">But it doesn’t hurt. I don’t know if it’s shock or a severed spinal cord or if the pain just hasn’t crawled upstream yet but that’s it, man, I’m dying, I <em class="calibre7">know</em> I’m dying. And it doesn’t hurt at all.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can still move my arms, though. And someone’s still screaming somewhere so I’m not completely alone, not yet, not yet. I heave over onto my back—vision’s shaky now, eyes swarming with floaters and there’s a red mist over everything, but if this is <em class="calibre7">it</em> then I want to at least go out looking my enemy in the eye, you know? And there it is, big as death, Armageddon in an airfoil and I still can’t see anything but a black shape behind blinding light but in my mind’s eye it’s got a hundred muzzles twitching and tracking, locking on, the fucker’s looking right at me and in the next instant a sonic boom goes off in my head.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>And the Eyes <em class="calibre7">stagger</em> in midair, like something just kicked them in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre20">For a second I think <em class="calibre7">That’s the weirdest recoil I’ve ever seen</em>, but then I realize it’s the <em class="calibre7">gunship</em> that’s been hit. And whatever that ship uses for a pilot has just realized the same thing, it’s forgotten all about me and it’s spinning in midair, looking for whatever arrogant motherfucker had the audacity to fight back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And there it is, pinned in the spotlight like a rock star.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s some kind of battlefield robot. It’s a cyclops with no face, no <em class="calibre7">room</em> for a face because that big bloody eye wraps halfway around its head. It’s like someone flayed one of those big Greek statues down to the muscles—because that’s all you can see, man, these bunched cords of muscle, gunmetal gray, almost oily in the searchlight, wrapped around a gleaming skeleton that pokes through here and there. You can see a spine. Something like a skull. There are knuckles and elbows and kneecaps and they gleam like chrome but you just know they have to be a thousand times stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I swear in that moment it’s ten meters tall. It comes striding across the wreckage like a great fucking golem, holding a cannon in one hand like it weighs a hundred grams, like it weighs nothing at all. The muscles flex and slide across one another with every step; they seem almost organic, but I’ve never seen anything live move quite like that.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It looks like it can take down that ship with a single shot.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It doesn’t, though. The gunship gets its licks in, fires back, hits the golem dead in the chest and not a word of a lie I swear that fucker <em class="calibre7">stays standing</em>. He staggers, rocks back on his heels, almost goes over. But he doesn’t. He keeps his footing, and he brings up that cannon again—I can see now it’s some kind of tricked-out miligun, way too big for mere mortals. He must’ve swiped it off a Taranis or something but he’s throwing it around like it’s a <a class="calibre21"></a>paperweight and the sound it makes, that beautiful sound, gotta be three thousand rounds a minute and the ammo belt’s flapping and slithering through that gun like .30-caliber tickertape.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m laughing like the Joker, I’m cheering him on so hard I almost forget I’m dying. He’s my guardian angel, he’s Gabriel blowing his horn against the heavens and that hellship is dipping and weaving and looking for an opening but it’s on fire now, it’s shitting smoke and listing to starboard and it can’t even seem to get a target lock anymore, all that devastating firepower just spraying in these wild arcs through the whole 360, hitting nothing but sea and sky.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Doesn’t blow up a moment too soon, though, because two seconds after it goes down my savior’s cannon is spinning on empty.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m kind of laughed out by now. Actually, I’m having a hard time even breathing. Blood pools at the back of my throat. I can barely cough it back up. But Gabriel hears me, even over the roaring of the flames. He sees me, and he comes to me through the smoke and the wreckage with that miligun still spinning in his hand, nothing to chew on anymore but sheer inertia. He seems to notice that after a second, throws the gun away without a second glance, kneels down at my side and stares at me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I stare back. Dark coppery visor, shiny and opaque; stubby metal snout underneath, some kind of integrated gasmask-respirator thingy. More of that corded gray muscle-armor across the cheeks, held anchored by metal strips running along the edge of the jaw; they meet up like mandibles where the mouth should be.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s like being face-to-face with a praying mantis.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He doesn’t say a damn thing for the longest time. <em class="calibre7">I</em> try to<em class="calibre7">—thank you</em>, or <em class="calibre7">nice shooting</em>, or even <em class="calibre7">what the fuck</em>—but those parts don’t seem to work anymore. Finally I hear an electrical hum and a voice comes out.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“Let me guess. You’re my ride out of here.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Golem. Angel. Cyclops. Robot. Still not sure <em class="calibre7">what</em> he is. It’s surreal. I think maybe I’m hallucinating. I think I’m having a near-death experience.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Looking back, that’s exactly what it was.</p>
<p class="calibre27">He saves me. I don’t know how long it takes. I’m not there for most of it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I remember movement; I remember being lifted up to Heaven, slung over my hero’s shoulder like a sack of potatoes. I remember the feel of great bundled cables ratcheting back and forth, biting into my gut. I remember it <em class="calibre7">hurting</em>, at long last. I’m in agony now, I’m flayed nerves and broken bones and guts fed through a wood chipper. I faint from the pain, and the pain shocks me back awake, and then I faint again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But I’m almost relieved, you know? Almost happy. I’m not dead yet, not yet. I’m still in the world. I can still <em class="calibre7">hurt</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Still can’t scream, though. Can’t make a sound.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I hear <em class="calibre7">him</em> talking. Through the helmet. A voice, filtered through some kind of vocoder; there’s an electronic buzz to it, a machine quality, but it sounds like there’s a real man inside trying to get out. He raises his voice. He rants. He falls silent now and then, like he’s listening. I listen, too, but I never hear anyone answer.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“This is what it was for, then. This is your Master Plan. You always have one, don’t you?</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Yeah, right. Not the clay’s place to question the potter. Except <em class="calibre7">your</em> feet are made out of the stuff just as much as mine, aren’t they? <em class="calibre7">Aren’t they?</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">“You’re not above it, you fucker. You’re no higher than I am. You may be <em class="calibre7">in</em> me, but you’re not above me.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“Goddamn you. You monster, you parasite. Goddamn you.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know if he’s swearing or praying.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Something’s screaming the next time I come to. It’s still not me; I try, believe me. I can barely manage a gurgle. But <em class="calibre7">something’s</em> screaming, and that sound bounces off walls and ceilings and hits me from all sides, tinged with metal.</p>
<p class="calibre20">My hope and my salvation. He’s brought me indoors.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I open my eyes, try to focus, can’t. But the flames are still with us; giant flickering shadows writhe on a wall, and the backlight is orange—except just off to my right, where it’s—wrong, somehow. Artificial. I turn my head just far enough to see the golem playing with a tiny blue sun dancing in his hand. <em class="calibre7">Laser</em>, I realize, and pass out again.</p>
<p class="calibre27">“Wake up.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not dead yet. Still not dead.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">“Wake up</em>, soldier. <em class="calibre7">Now.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">Same place, different time. Bright dirty sunlight pools on the floor from barred windows high overhead.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I actually feel a bit better now. The pain’s more—distant. That’s good; it means all those nerves sending back reports from my broken fucked-up body have finally cashed it in. It means that maybe I can die in peace.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Wake <em class="calibre7">the fuck UP</em>!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something big and dark and flaccid hangs in front of me. I force my eyes to squint, force my brain to interpret: a skinned carcass, a flayed—</p>
<p class="calibre20">—golem—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Instant focus.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>My savior’s been gutted like a fish. It hangs deflated from an overhead beam, split down the middle and scooped clean of its insides. All those high-tech gunmetal muscles dangle limp and unmoving; the interior glistens red as raw meat. Are my eyes fucking up again, or is that butchered carcass <em class="calibre7">bleeding</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Down here.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Big black dude. Shaved head, some kind of skintight black body stocking pimped out with white veins. Like a wet suit with a circulatory system. Dirt and blood smeared across his face and for one crazy surreal second I think he has <em class="calibre7">gills</em>, but no; it’s just a bloody gash, still oozing, along the line of his jaw. I concentrate on his shoulder flash until it stops jumping around: <span><span class="calibre9">AIRBORNE</span></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He’s got some kind of hypo in one hand. I can feel the tingle, now; he’s just emptied it into my arm.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Don’t try to talk,” he says. (I almost laugh, but the pain surges back when I try.) “Just let it take hold. You’re gonna make it. You’re gonna make it.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">It sounds like an apology.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He’s not doing so well himself, you know. There’s a trickle of blood threading out of his nose, he’s swaying on his feet, his face is as gray as that wall behind you. One of his eyes is bloodshot, like every capillary ruptured at once. His hands are shaking. His eyes dart around like a bird’s, like there aren’t enough shadows in this place to hold all the monsters he sees—and there are <em class="calibre7">still</em> a lot of shadows here, that dirty daylight doesn’t kill the darkness so much as just … throw it into high contrast. He doesn’t seem to be seriously injured, physically—no bones broken that I can see, no major wounds—but it’s obvious he’s way past your garden-variety thousand-yard stare. I’ve seen some pretty horrific shit over the past couple of hours, and I’m looking my own death in the face, and even so I can tell he’s <em class="calibre7">far</em> farther into hell than I am.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Something lands on the roof; metal clangs against metal. Airborne glances up at the sound and his face lights up. I mean, literally <em class="calibre7">lights up;</em> I could swear that dark skin <em class="calibre7">brightened</em> for just a second, but I blink and it’s gone. I hear scuttling sounds, but it’s dark up there; I can’t see anything but the ghostly dim shapes of rafters.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Don’t worry about that.” He jerks his chin at the ceiling. “That’s the least of your problems.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">More sounds from overhead; a soft gritty patter of displaced dust drizzles down on us. Those rafters look like a rib cage. I flash back to a half-remembered Bible story from the Vision channel, something about gods and whales. I wonder for a moment if some alien monster hasn’t swallowed us whole.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You are so fucked,” Airborne says, and his voice is—empty. Transparent. As if the man has already gone away, and left some kind of autopilot in charge.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“There’s no time,” it says, and I can see I was wrong; the man hasn’t gone away, not yet. He’s still trapped in those eyes, one red, one white, jerking back and forth in panicked little arcs while the chassis short-circuits around them. But whatever’s running the voice is still online, and it’s got priority now. “It’s up to you now, soldier. I can’t do this anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Suddenly those red-and-white eyes lock onto mine. They drill into me like restraining bolts, like spikes through my head. I really don’t like what I see in there and I try to look away, but no dice; I just about pass out from the effort. And he’s starting to <em class="calibre7">glow</em> again, there’s a kind of <em class="calibre7">mesh</em> lighting up his cheeks from inside, like honeycomb. Dude has one of those bioluminescent tattoos, you know, the ones where they inject the glowing bacteria? The more excited you get the more they light up—it’s a blood-flow thing, dissolved oxygen and whatnot—and this dude must be <em class="calibre7">very</em> fucking excited because that honeycomb is just about incan<em class="calibre7">des</em>cent in his face, man, like those old lightbulbs with the filaments.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>But I’m fading again. I can’t hold focus, I can feel myself passing out. I might as well have snowglobes for eyeballs, there’s so many floaters swirling around in there. The whole damn world disappears down a spinning tunnel, into a vortex of static with those wild wild eyes at the center, and that sad dead voice behind them saying <em class="calibre7">This is the best I can do …</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">And something <em class="calibre7">engulfs</em> me from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s like being devoured by an oil slick. Something warm and slippery wraps around my arms and legs and chest and at first it hurts holy <em class="calibre7">fuck</em> it hurts, but then the pain recedes and whatever steps up to take its place is <em class="calibre7">really</em> nice. Way better than morphine; it takes the edge off the pain but it doesn’t make you the least bit stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre20">My head clears. I experience new thoughts, I experience <em class="calibre7">old</em> thoughts in a whole new way. It’s unprecedented. (I can even roll worlds like <em class="calibre7">unprecedented</em> around in my head without feeling like an asshole, although I’m not sure how I feel about that.)</p>
<p class="calibre20">But it’s not just that my brain is firing on all cylinders again; like I said, it feels <em class="calibre7">good</em>. I figure it must be one of those new dopamine analogs you hear about, and then I remember <em class="calibre7">where</em> I heard about it: It was a MacroNet puff piece I caught out the corner of my eye for fifteen seconds <em class="calibre7">two years</em> ago. Either I really am dying and the whole life-before-your-eyes thing is <em class="calibre7">way</em> overrated, or this giant alien slug has just amped up my memory somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre20">My vision fuzzes and clicks into a kind of high-def crystalline focus that doesn’t quite seem real, you know that ultra-high rez you find in raw tactical sims and cheap video games. Alphanumerics start scrolling up across my field of view, boot sequences and tactical overlays, but they’re <em class="calibre7">inside</em> me somehow, you know? It looks subjectively like a head-up display but we’re not talking about your usual HUD: Something’s planting these glyphics <em class="calibre7">directly into my head</em>. More of a, a Brain-Up Display I guess. A BUD.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>I’ve got my legs back, I’m upright, I can move again. I bring up my arm and there it is, the muscle suit, crawling around my forearm like an octopus as I clench my fist, flexing and tightening and accommodating every movement. It <em class="calibre7">flickers</em> as I watch; waves of light and darkness chase each other across my arm like storm clouds on fast-forward. Colors bleed along their edges—deep-sea green, stratospheric cerulean, who knows what the marketing boys are calling those parts of the spectrum these days. Suddenly my arm <em class="calibre7">disappears</em>, turns into liquid glass and just <em class="calibre7">fades</em>. A progress bar grows across my eyeball; a readout underneath tells me that <span><span class="calibre9">CHROMATOPHORE INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE</span></span> is 87 percent complete. When it hits 100 my arm fades back into view—just boring utilitarian gray again, laced through with a faint hexagonal mesh that looks a lot like Airborne’s tattoo (I guess ol’ Airborne doesn’t have a lot of imagination when it comes to accessorizing). Tactical says <span><span class="calibre9">CLOAK OK</span></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I am Gabriel. I am Golem Boy, I am my own hope and my salvation. And even though I must still be a pile of shattered bones and torn-up viscera inside this magic armor, somehow I feel just fucking <em class="calibre7">awesome</em>. Even wild-eyed Officer Airborne kneels before me, hands raised in supplication.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Except that’s not what he’s doing at all, of course. He’s bolting me into this suit of his, tightening the last couple of lug nuts on my sternum. “Feels good, doesn’t it? I bet it does. Gets old fast, though. Believe me.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something’s changed about him. The spasms haven’t stopped, the tremors are as bad as ever, but that demon in his eyes, that panic—it’s gone, somehow. His face is dark; the tattoo’s gone back to sleep. The right eye is completely opaque now—a solid ball of scarlet, you can’t see anything in there anymore—but the left is almost peaceful. He fixes me with this sad, steady stare, and he says, “It’s alive, you know. Obsessed, you might say. It won’t <a class="calibre21"></a>move on until I do, it’s … viral. But it means well. Keep that in mind and you just might pull this off.”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">Pull WHAT off</em>, I try to say.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He answers as if I’ve succeeded. “Find Gould. Nathan Gould. It’s all I can do now, <em class="calibre7">you’re</em> all I can do. I’m sorry, man. I’m so fucking sorry. It’s all on you now.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He can barely stand, he’s shaking so hard. There’s a rattle in his chest I’ve heard too many times before. He staggers, turns, takes in the filth and the dereliction looming on all sides. “Look at this fucking place,” he whispers, and even above the crackling of flames and the groaning of distant wreckage and all the faint faraway screaming, I can hear him perfectly. I swear I can even hear the beating of his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“They used to call me Prophet,” he says. “Remember me.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">And puts a service pistol under his chin and blows his own head off.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div>
