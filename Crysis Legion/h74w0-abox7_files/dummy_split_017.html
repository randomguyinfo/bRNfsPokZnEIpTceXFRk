<p class="calibre16">Not really sure what’s real here, and what’s the spawn of my fevered, fetid, infested imagination. I see Ling Shan, although I’ve never been. I see constellations in an alien junkyard, spinning slowly on the surface of an invisible globe. A voice threads through it all, a voice that talks as though we’re old friends although I can’t quite make out the words. I’ve never heard it before.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><span><span class="calibre9">SYSTEM START</span></span> flickers at the corner of my eye.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><span><span class="calibre9">CN COMBAT SOLUTIONS</span></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><span><span class="calibre9">SYNAPSE CHECKSUM …</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre20">The boot crawl scrolls over my visions, eats them away like acid. By the time it’s gone through its song and dance there’s nothing left to see but two words: <span><span class="calibre9">PHAGE ISOLATED</span></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can make out what the voice is saying, now. It’s telling me to wake up. It sounds worried.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It calls me <em class="calibre7">son</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I open my eyes and look up at the dome of smoke covering Manhattan. There’s something up there that doesn’t belong somehow, bright threads of blue and yellow lacerating the overcast like veins of quartz. It takes me a moment to remember what it is.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh, right. Sunlight. Sky. It jerks for a moment, as if someone just fucked with the vertical hold in my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“Come back, son. Focus.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Tactical returns, slow and halting. Icons flicker on and off and on again, as if not quite sure they’re in the right place. The sky jerks again, but this time I realize it’s not just my eyesight: Something’s—tugging at me. I lift my head.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Those fucking ticks. Those bloodsuckers. One of them has its hooks into the N2. It’s pretty much all the wake-up call I need: I <em class="calibre7">hate</em> those things. I kick the little fucker and am back on my feet in a second, reaching for a gun that isn’t there, looking up and down a street that seems to be hosting a goddamn tick <em class="calibre7">parade</em>. Some of them carry nothing but the swollen bladders on their own backs. One or two are actually dragging body parts, like ants taking crumbs to the nest.</p>
<p class="calibre20">My own personal chaperone is back, trying to take me down by the ankle. My gun lies a dozen meters away: Golem Boy don’t need no goddamn carbine to stomp it like a big ugly zit. None of the others seem to notice. They don’t seem interested in anything that moves under its own steam.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I’m getting a limited feed from your suit, but for now it’ll have to do.” A little window opens up in my visual field and there he is, standard old white dude, maybe midsixties, looks like he was cut-and-pasted out of some black-and-white video from a hundred years ago. “I don’t believe we’ve been introduced. Jack Hargreave, at your service. Nathan Gould might have mentioned my name, although I don’t imagine he had much good to say about me.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Actually, old man, Nathan says you want me dead.</p>
<p class="calibre20">On the other hand, Tara Strickland says you want me alive. It’s <em class="calibre7">Lockhart</em> who wants me dead, and I know for a fact that Lockhart has an absolute fucking <em class="calibre7">hate-on</em> for Jack Hargreave.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I have to ask you to take Nathan’s opinions with a grain of salt. He’s a fine man, I think the world of him personally, wouldn’t have kept him on so long if I didn’t. But he’s also something <a class="calibre21"></a>of a fuckup, pardon my French. All those psychotropics he dropped out on the left coast—they’ve dulled his edge a bit. Not quite the clear thinker he once—well, we could spend hours on the long and sordid relationship between Nathan Gould and Jack Hargreave, but right now there are far more pressing concerns.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You are standing not far from the diseased bureaucratic heart of this city. And while you’d think that airlifting all the politicians out of the place should have had a cleansing effect, sadly, what’s replaced them isn’t a lot better. Go on, see for yourself. Follow the parade.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He does not pat me on the head or offer me a Milk-Bone. Probably only because the N2 doesn’t come with those options.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“By the way,” Hargreave adds after a couple of seconds have passed and I still haven’t saluted. “I’m given to understand someone may have told you you’re dead. I would urge you not to put too much faith in definitions designed primarily to allow the health insurance industry to cut benefits at the first appearance of a hangnail. Life and death are far more malleable than most people imagine, as you are finding out for yourself; and while, yes, you may technically fall into the latter category at the moment, I have access to certain—remedies—denied most policy-holders. Don’t you worry, son. I’ll be right there with you, and if you do this for me—for the <em class="calibre7">planet</em>—we’ll get you patched right up. After all, it’s my technology that’s already made you such an active corpse.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He has a point. This, this high-tech infestation wrapped around me—it’s Hargreave’s property. He built the damn thing, or pirated it at least. He designed the people-friendly interface that papers over all those scary alien guts that I hope to Christ someone understands. And he’ll <em class="calibre7">be right here with me</em>. Of course you will, Jack. You are my Lord and my Shepherd, and you’ve probably been walking with me since the moment I died. A comm link without an off-switch is the least of your divine powers: <a class="calibre21"></a>I bet you’ve built overrides and remotes into every fucking circuit in this thing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Still, that whole not-being-dead thing. That would be really nice.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave wants me to follow the parade? I follow the parade.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m in a shallow depression of cracked asphalt, a street collapsed into some hollow space below, ankle-deep in wastewater from half a dozen broken mains. Hargreave leads me from the valley of the shadow. He leads me through half-assed barricades, past schools of dead yellow cabs and burning police cars. Something bleats from the rooftops; I look up in time to see a blur of pink flannel before the baby bursts like a grapefruit against the pavement. Its mother hits a second later without a sound.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Infected. Infected.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Stay the course, son,” Hargreave says sadly. “There’s nothing you can do for them.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">A woman cries out from a shattered window twelve stories above Liberty Street; a man and his daughter call for help from a balcony over Fulton. Sometimes I see them before they see me; I cloak, and creep past without ever raising their hopes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He tries to distract me with tales of our mutual acquaintance. “Don’t get me wrong about Nathan; his heart is definitely in the right place, he’s the same humanitarian he ever was. He’s just—lost that edge that once made him so brilliant. That ability to make intuitive leaps, <em class="calibre7">counterintuitive</em> leaps, that distinguish the great minds from the merely competent. Case in point: He finds the black box in that second skin of yours and he just assumes it’s some kind of blueprint: the genspecs to fight the spore.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Three stories’ worth of old iron fire escapes lie smashed on the sidewalk; someone’s hung a bedsheet from the railing of the fourth, painted a slapdash <span><span class="calibre9">NEED FOOD &amp; WATER</span></span> for any Meals On Wheels truck that might be cruising past.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Ten years ago Nathan would have seen the truth instantly. <a class="calibre21"></a>The suit doesn’t contain the specs for a weapon. The suit <em class="calibre7">is</em> the weapon. It just needs to be activated.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He takes me through an abandoned field hospital: Quonset huts lined up in an underground parkade, all cots empty, body bags stacked in neat virgin piles. Down in some subterranean food court I pass through an improvised checkpoint blocked out in chain link and razor wire: rows of tables, suitcases and backpacks with their contents turned out and spread under racks of purple UV. Ticks clatter past, draining the dead while Hargreave natters like a Discovery Channel voice-over: “Think of the Argentine Cattle Crisis two years ago, or the British BSE outbreak in the last century. The issue was not slaughtering the animals, the problem was <em class="calibre7">disposal</em>. What do you do with millions of rotting corpses? Here you see the Ceph’s answer. They wipe us out, they break us down, they reduce the environmental impact almost to zero. Exemplary, really.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The ticks have spilled onto Dutch Avenue. I’m starting to see that this isn’t a parade after all. It’s a <em class="calibre7">drainage basin</em>, full of little tick streams that join up to form mighty tick rivers that converge on—</p>
<p class="calibre20">I turn the corner at Spruce.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I have no idea what happened here. I think this used to be City Hall—three stories of arched windows, topped by a domed tower almost as high again—and I think the space in front of it used to be a park. But some giant has jammed a spade into the crust of the planet and just <em class="calibre7">twisted</em>. There’s a rift in front of me, a <em class="calibre7">canyon</em> where the ground has opened up. The road runs off its edge and ends in tatters like a hacked-off limb. An eighteen-wheeler leans over the break, cab dangling in midair; it looks almost curious, craning its neck to see down into the pit. Broken sewer pipes jut from the cliff face. There used to be a subway line down there, too; it’s been chopped in half like a worm by a shovel, the track line pulled into daylight and torn apart, subway cars scattered <a class="calibre21"></a>around the gap like cheap-ass Chinese toys. There are outfalls everywhere, and fires, and down through the mist and the smoke I see the vague shapes of uprooted trees and fractured asphalt.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s something else down there, too, something deeper than the merely human wreckage. I can only catch glimpses through the pieces of rock and road blocking the way, but that segmented bony aesthetic is almost familiar by now. Way down deep, built into bedrock under one of the most densely populated cities in the world: an architecture that couldn’t have been put together by anything we’d think of as <em class="calibre7">hands</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Way off on the far side of City Hall I see a silhouette in the smoke; it looms maybe twice as high as the dome that foregrounds it. Another Ceph spire, and I’m praying to fucking Allah it’s already shot its load.</p>
<p class="calibre20">This is Tick Mecca. This is the point of their pilgrimage, this is where they bring the liquefied dead of Manhattan: a clacking, clicking river flowing down into the center of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You have to go down there, son,” Hargreave says solemnly</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m not your fucking son, Jack.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But I go down anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre27">What happens if I just say no? Good question.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I was keeping an eye out, you know. Ever since the suit mutinied at Trinity. That was a kick in the throat, man—kinda paled next to being dead, but it added insult to injury. Like I’d been on a leash all that time and just hadn’t known it, because SECOND’d never yanked me to heel before.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It never tried to pull that shit again. Of course, I never tried to cross it again. It fed me objectives and I pretty much went along with them. And most of the time, why wouldn’t I? BUD points out the most likely local spots for cached ammo and I’m <em class="calibre7">not</em> going to weapon up? Hargreave offers my life back if I follow <a class="calibre21"></a>the parade and I’m going to go in the opposite direction? Why? Just to prove I can?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Still, what if I <em class="calibre7">tried</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Of course, those were early days, before the N2 really got to know me. We have a much better relationship now. Now it would never lock me down against my will. It just makes sure I’m always willing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You do know how this thing works, right? They’ve told you that much, at least?</p>
<p class="calibre20">We’re not talking about a meatport here, I’m not one of those new cybersoldiers with the spinal jacks. We’re talking about carbon nanotubes and room-temp superconductors. Synthetic myelin. Tendrils finer than human hairs burrowing into me, sniffing their way up and down my backbone, twisting up through that hole where the spine enters the skull.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You don’t wear the N2, you <em class="calibre7">mate</em> with it. You <em class="calibre7">fuse</em>. And it feels pretty good at first, let me tell you. It feels great—and after a while you start wondering <em class="calibre7">why</em> it feels so great. A neuron’s a neuron, right? When you get right down to it, what’s the difference between sending signals to my visual cortex and sending signals to any other part of my brain? BUD shows me unreal images; who’s to say SECOND doesn’t give me unreal thoughts, unreal feelings? A bit of icy calm to help you figure the angles before a big dustup? A bit of extra hate to help you mow the motherfuckers down in the crunch?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Dude. Spare me your pitying looks. You think you’re any better off than me? Did <em class="calibre7">you</em> get any say in how your brain was wired up? You think all that sticky circuitry you call <em class="calibre7">thought</em> just makes itself? Every effect has a cause, man: You can believe in physics or you can believe in free will, but you can’t have it both ways. The only difference between you and me is, I’m part of something bigger now. We’ve got a <em class="calibre7">purpose</em>, Roger, bigger than yours, bigger than your bosses’, so much bigger than you. So you might want <a class="calibre21"></a>to start asking yourself if the people behind those cameras are the sort of folks to whom you really want to pledge your allegiance.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Because there are other sides to be on, you know. And maybe it’s not too late to get on the right one.</p>
<p class="calibre27"><em class="calibre7">You have to go down there, son</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Turns out I’m not the first guy he told that to.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There were these tremors, apparently. A dozen seismographs grumbling about something under City Hall, even before the ground opened up. So just a couple of days ago, Jack Hargreave sent a squad down into the subway. Their signals garbled. Their signals stopped. They haven’t come back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave sends me down the same tunnel: a long dirty intestine lined with train tracks, torqued and twisted and torn open enough to let in occasional shafts of dirty gray light from overhead. I share the passageway with occasional ticks, but they’re headed the other way and they don’t bother me; their bladders are already filled to bursting. I imagine stomping on them and watching them go <em class="calibre7">splat</em>. Once or twice I indulge the fantasy.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fifty meters in, the tunnel opens into a subway station. The walls are cracked and oozing, the overhead pipes burst. Puddles on the floor. Most of the lights have been smashed; a few hang from the wires at one end, sparking and flickering. There’s graffiti all over the walls, <span><span class="calibre9">FUCK YOU</span></span> and <span><span class="calibre9">EAT THE RICH</span></span> and <span><span class="calibre9">THANK YOU LORD</span></span>. Trash bins kicked over. Shotgun blasts and little high-caliber divots scattered like terminal acne over every surface.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Actually, it probably doesn’t look much different than it did <em class="calibre7">before</em> the invasion.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s a blood trail smeared across the tiles, around the corner, into a crumbling backstage service area. I find three bodies at the end of it: CELL, but not the usual mall-cop colors. Better armor, for one thing. Different insignia. More—understated.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“My men,” Hargreave murmurs. “I’d hoped …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He sounds almost choked up. Almost <em class="calibre7">sincere</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I give him a moment, scavenge the remains: frag grenades, laser scope, ammo clips. A scarab with a cracked handguard. One of those nice big L-TAG smart grenade launchers that grunts like me never seem to get their hands on.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Casualties of war, I suppose. We all make sacrifices.” Hargreave has come to terms with his grief. I never knew the traditional <em class="calibre7">minute of silence</em> could be so therapeutic. “I don’t see Reeves here, though. Don’t see the scanning gear, either. See if you can find it; it might give us a little advance warning on what we’re heading into.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I find him through a rusted fire exit, halfway down another tunnel where the loading platform is high and dry and the tracks themselves are knee-deep in the water table. Derelict train cars, knocked off their rails, sit in the water like gondolas in the world’s most butt-ugly Tunnel of Love.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Mitchell Reeves lies dead on the loading platform with two of his homeys, twitching under the ministrations of a pair of ticks. I waste some ammo on a bit of cheap visceral satisfaction, pry Reeves’s field laptop from his cold dead fingers. The tech’s proprietary from boards to buttons, but the I/O’s standard WiFi.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave delivers the eulogy as SECOND builds the connection. “Best I had, aside from Tara Strickland. What a waste.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Reeves stares through me while his machine shakes hands. At least he still has eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">At least the spore left him with that much.</p>
<p class="calibre27">I’m heading for something Hargreave calls “the Hive.” Doesn’t that sound like fun. According to Reeves’s laptop it’s almost dead north. This subway tunnel curves northeast.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Close enough.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The tunnels arched and ancient and lined with patterned tiles that wouldn’t look half bad if someone stripped off about a hundred years of grease and black mold. Some stretches have grimy skylights behind ornate iron grilles, and the dim dirty light that filters down might even be natural. Others are lit by yellow bulbs in cheap tin chandeliers. I slosh past cracks and cave-ins and zigzag chains of derailed cars as Hargreave checks out Reeves’s data. I climb along tracks that used to be flat; now they’ve been wrenched into roller coasters. Sparking fluorescents and brain-dead signal lights flash at random, filling the passages with brightness and shadow and flickering bloody twilight.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I never walk alone. Hargreave whispers in my ear. Ceph infantry stalk along the tunnels and shoot on sight, hooting and chittering and clicking. I must be on the right track; their numbers climb the farther I go. Too many to take on at once; the suit isn’t flooding me with bloodlust so I guess it agrees. We cloak in fits and starts, and try to pass unseen.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It works for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something crashes down into the tunnel just ahead: a steel fist, a battering ram, a subway car punching through from an overhead line like Thor’s Hammer through a leaky condom. I don’t know what sent it down here, I don’t know if it’s accident or assault, I don’t know what set the fucking thing on fire. But there it is, forty meters dead ahead, a few hundred tons of torqued and screaming metal, belching flames and smoke. It spits pieces everywhere: shards of glass, ragged little shurikens of flaming metal, chunks of concrete ricocheting from the shattered wall. One of them must have hit me, because suddenly I can see my shadow dancing in the firelight like a big fucking arrowhead.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And all these armed and armored garden slugs see it, too.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They’re on me from angles I didn’t even know they had: from <a class="calibre21"></a>behind, from around the corner of the burning train, but from above, too, from overhead service catwalks I’ve been too fucking stupid to even notice all this time. They fire through grilles and gratings way too narrow for a clean return shot—and man, even the grunts I <em class="calibre7">can</em> get a bead on are way tougher than they have any right to be. I’m pumping off shots that blow good-sized divots out of reinforced concrete, and these fuckers just <em class="calibre7">take</em> it. Four, five shots to bring them down sometimes—even with all that unprotected meat showing—and I don’t have nearly enough ammo to go around.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s a service closet at my back, heavy door, double-locked, but a few wild shots from the Ceph take care of that before I even get there. I manage to duck back inside an instant before the armor setting bleeds out the cells. It gives me some cover, buys the suit a bit of recharge time. I fire around the corner often enough to keep the Squids from advancing too quickly, but they’re out there and I’m in here and this is not what you’d call a sustainable situation.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I switch to StarlAmp—light flickers in through the doorway but the corners of this little cave are still deep in shadow—and I spare a moment to survey the digs. There’s a pail in here, and a mop. A fuse box on the wall, jammed with breakers and switches and high-voltage cables. There’s a bloated corpse squirming with spore, some poor bastard who found a dark place to die. I flash back to all the other poor bastards before him, the Rapture-heads, the suicidal mothers, the bodies twitching in the street like frog’s legs jumping to an electric current—</p>
<p class="calibre20">And suddenly I see something else in here, too. I see a way out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I duck back around the corner and hand out way more ammo than I should. Ceph scatter before my suppressing fire; I catch at least two of them right in the dorsal tentacles, blow a couple of those waving wormy things right the fuck <em class="calibre7">off</em>, leave them flapping on the ground while their owners dive for cover. Doesn’t even <a class="calibre21"></a>slow them down. Gotta hand it to the slugs; if someone blew off one of <em class="calibre7">my</em> limbs I don’t think I’d be quite so blasé about it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then I think: <em class="calibre7">Predator–prey</em>. And then I think: <em class="calibre7">Nature documentaries</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And suddenly, for just that one brief instant, Ceph battle armor—the sheer idiocy of leaving all that meat exposed to enemy fire—almost makes a kind of sense.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe it’s like those reef fish that have the big fake eyespots down near the tail, to trick predators into going for the wrong end. Maybe those big wavy tentacles are vulnerable by <em class="calibre7">design</em>, maybe they’re not gills or penises but <em class="calibre7">cannon fodder</em>. Maybe the whole <em class="calibre7">point</em> is to look vulnerable, to draw enemy fire to something that can be dropped and discarded the way a lizard sheds its tail, leaves the predator chewing on some scaly scrap while the primary target skitters away unharmed.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Now I’m not saying that kind of Animal Planet shit would necessarily work when you graduate to dustups that use actual honest-to-God technology. Any enemy smart enough to lob a flashbang or build an SMG is gonna figure that trick out pretty quick. But so what? Why go out of your way to shield something that only exists to be blown off in the first place? You don’t need it for anything, so you might as well allocate your resources to something that matters.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Apropos of nothing, of course. Just a friendly pointer in case you ever find yourself face-to-phallus with those slimy little fuckers in the near future.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But it’s just a flash, really, a little chunk of insight crammed into the space of an eyeblink. The brain plays with the theory but the body keeps the plan in motion. My suppressing fire has got the Ceph to back off a bit, given me a few extra seconds to put the pieces into place. I rip open that switch box, I rip out those cables, I loop them up and tie them together. And when I cloak at last, fully charged, and sneak back out into the tunnel, the <a class="calibre21"></a>Ceph don’t even notice—because they still hear me, trapped in that little room. They can still see my shadow moving in there, framed by the flickering blue light of shorted circuits. And by the time they get their nerve back and rush my defenses—by the time they discover that corpse wired up like a marionette, live cables under its arms, dancing a fifty-thousand-volt jig against the wall—I’m already behind enemy lines.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Galvanic reflexes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I bet I’m the only one in my whole fucking squad who would’ve thought of that.</p>
<p class="calibre27">The ghost of Mitchell Reeves leads me on to an impassable cave-in where his living body planted canisters of C-4 before turning back to die a thousand meters farther upstream. I don’t know why he never detonated them: But I do, and when the dust and the wreckage have settled I crawl from the tunnel we made into one we didn’t: a place full of shadows and segmented machines and dim, sickly gray light.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I think it’s a cave at first, carved from the bedrock beneath Manhattan and almost as large. Great curving spinal columns of dark gunmetal arc across the vast space, orange eyespots glimmering from each vertebra. Massive towers of wheels and gears and sawtooth machinery loom ahead. A cave, a subterranean city. But then something rises out of a fissure ahead—a floating cannon, a flying abortion put together from gun belts and engine blocks, all its viscera welded to the outside of its hull. The usual flickering red levitators push it into the sky, and as I watch it rise I see there <em class="calibre7">is</em> a sky up there, grim and gloomy, but that is not the roof of a cave and this is no hollow beneath Manhattan. This is an open pit, and up around its edges I can see the towers of New York.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Then I’m flat on my back, and a horse has just kicked me in the chest.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>A horse, or a high-caliber armor-piercing round. Tactical vectors back and highlights a target halfway up a faraway cliff face, too hidden in the local cover for a make. Not human, though.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Ah,” Hargreave murmurs. “That’s interesting.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">No warnings on tactical.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Stay absolutely still. If its dealings so far have been with ordinary soldiers, it thinks you’re dead. Act like it.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I sacc’ suit diagnostics just to be sure. No redlights.</p>
<p class="calibre20">SECOND keeps a targeting triangle on the sniper as it emerges from cover. A single impossible bound and it’s covered half the distance. Another jump; it’s on the ledge with me, not ten steps away. It steps forward with that strange half-upright-half-panther gait. I swear it’s cocking its headpiece at me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It was mainly grunts in the subway. I wonder how this carbine works point-blank against stalkers.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It actually works pretty well. But I’m guessing this means they know I’m coming.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Jack Hargreave fills my helmet with waypoints and mission objectives. I descend into the pit and he talks about ecology, and insect societies. I look up at a murky yellow sky and he rhapsodizes about evolution and coral reefs. He warns me that I am in a hive, that the level of infestation is high, that I have to be <em class="calibre7">careful</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But all I can see are the thousands of infected rotting on the streets behind me, and I don’t <em class="calibre7">want</em> to be careful. I don’t give a flying fuck about <em class="calibre7">infestation</em>. There can’t ever be <em class="calibre7">enough</em> of these fuckers in my sights, not as long as I’ve got a weapon in my hands and ammo to feed it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And oh, Roger, it’s as though all of fucking Cephdom has gathered here to grant that very wish.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m not crazy enough to take them all on head-to-head; there are stalkers here that jump like fleas and shoot like snipers, Heavies <a class="calibre21"></a>that barely feel a direct hit with a fragmentation grenade. I cloak and cover, I hide, I fight on the run and never in a straight line. But there are times. Times a bogeyman falls injured in front of me and instead of finishing the job with a burst of firepower I lift the fucker over my head and smash it against one of its own machines. There are time when I find cracks in the armor, and pry them open, and rip out that translucent gray Spam by the fistful. There are times I shoot to kill, and times I flip that gun around and use it as a fucking club.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They’re all the same to me, every stalker like every other, each grunt as faceless as the last. I don’t know if they’re clones or assembly-line robots, I don’t know if the suit’s just filtering out their distinguishing traits to keep my conscience dead, and I don’t care. But there’s one Heavy down here who doesn’t line up with the others. It doesn’t go down, it doesn’t give up, it doesn’t stop moving. It lumbers like a fucking cow but somehow it always manages to get out of the way of my grenades, somehow my armor-piercing rounds just never seem to get through.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And I swear, Roger, Ceiling Cat as my witness, this thing has as big a grudge as I do. It sees me airing out its buddies, sees the ranks thinning down, and it doesn’t chitter or burble like the other Ceph: it <em class="calibre7">roars</em>. I can outrun it easily enough—I’m the hare to its tortoise, and yes I am painfully aware of who won <em class="calibre7">that</em> particular contest, thank you very much—but somehow it always manages to get ahead of me after I leave it behind, always manages to rise up between me and my waypoints. It comes after me like a runaway semi, like I’d raped its mother, and it’s smart enough to play to my weaknesses. I could stay ahead of the fucking thing if I didn’t have to deal with some grunt or stalker on the side every time I turned around. But the Heavy keeps coming, runs me down, forces me to drain my suit. Then, once I’m bled down to moving at pathetic baseline human speeds<em class="calibre7">—then</em> those cannon arms shoot out missiles from an endless ammo belt <a class="calibre21"></a>that must reach into another fucking dimension, the damn thing never runs dry. I try to keep to the high ground and some stalker sails higher, raining down plasma and lightning. I take cover behind rockfalls and overturned dumpsters and grunts swarm me like giant lethal gnats.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know how it happens but it catches me in the open. A missile slams into the rock face just a few meters to my left—not a direct hit but close enough, close enough. The blast kicks me into the air like a tumbleweed in a windstorm; half a dozen redlights bloom on BUD. The world spins and then stops with a jolt, way too soon, way too high. I’m back on the ground but not <em class="calibre7">that</em> ground. I’m higher up. I’m on a ledge, an uplifted chunk of asphalt. There’s a car behind me. Yellow cab. More cabs than cockroaches in this burg.</p>
<p class="calibre20">From just out of sight, past the lip of the ledge, the sound of something pounding the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Carbine’s gone. The scarab won’t do shit against this thing. I’ve got grenades but the Heavy just—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh, wait …</p>
<p class="calibre20">The charge level’s barely grazing 50 percent but it’ll have to do. I slap two stickies onto the front of the cab, set the timers so they don’t blow up in my face. Whatever the suit’s got to give, it gives now. Lord: Give me Strength.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I <em class="calibre7">kick</em>. The cab skids off the ledge and sails down in a beautiful arc that ends right on the head of that missile-spitting motherfucker. The sound of massive metal objects smashing together: just beautiful, Roger. Just fucking beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It doesn’t die. But it goes down, pinned under two thousand kilograms of Chevrolet’s finest alloys. I can hear the roars of my vanquished enemy, I can see the car swaying and rocking as the thing underneath struggles to free itself before the timers run down.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Doesn’t take much to set off a sticky. Even a footstep within <a class="calibre21"></a>a couple of meters is enough if you crank the sensitivity. And this bruiser, it’s moving that cab around like a goddamn seesaw. It’s half a second, tops, between the timers zeroing out and the whole damn vehicle going up in a ball of fire, HE, and gasoline. It’s almost too long. The Heavy’s actually tipping the cab up on its side by the time the stickies detonate, actually getting back to its feet when its feet get blown out from under it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But you know what they say. Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades.</p>
<p class="calibre27">After a while they stop coming for me. After a while they get harder to find. But Jacob Hargreave is still there, telling me what I have to do.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A riot of alien machinery sits in the center of the pit like some kind of nerve ganglion, radiating those massive spokes in all directions. The base of a Ceph spire rises from its center: the same spire I saw past City Hall. Most of the spokes look like the backbones of some colossal cyborg; three sprout a pair of leg-like spines from each segment. They look like the bodies of monstrous centipedes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Ah,” Hargreave says. “Yes. Well.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I wait for something a bit more helpful. I wait for more Ceph to come pouring through the walls and tear me apart. All I see are spines, and pipes, and see-through panels here and there—portholes, almost—behind which clouds of spore swirl and seethe like coffee grounds. They’re not going anywhere, though. The flow is random, chaotic, like boiling water trapped in a pot: all wired up and no place to go.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“From the look of this feed, the spore loop’s running near dormant levels,” Hargreave says at last. “We’ll need to fix that. There must be triggers around here, but what they look like is anyone’s guess …”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Turns out those centipede spokes are key. So I follow one of them out of the spear, across the pit, back down to earth where it plunges into some terminal structure of plates and spines and glowing orange slots. I find the interfaces, I go through the motions. The plumbing trembles under my hand; the spore in the nearest porthole begins to surge back up the conduit, toward the machinery at center stage. One down, two to—</p>
<p class="calibre20">What?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Uh, Hargreave must’ve—Yeah, that’s right. Hargreave told me. I mean, how else would I know? It’s not like those controls looked like anything <em class="calibre7">I’d</em> ever seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Damn good question. You should ask him.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh. Right.</p>

<strong class="calibre26">CSIRA Blackbody Council</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre29">Pre-Testimony Interview, Partial Transcript, 27/08/2023</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre29">Subject: Nathan Gould</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31"><em class="calibre7">Excerpt begins:</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">You know how dreams work, right? Our brains are full of static; neurons just fire off at random sometimes, not thoughts or anything, just—background noise. The visual cortex gets its share, but normally you don’t notice ’cause the signals coming in over your optic nerves are so much stronger, they just swamp everything else.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">When you’re asleep, though, there’s nothing coming in through the main cables. Nothing to drown out the static. And the brain—notices. It’s got these pattern-matching circuits and when static’s all they’ve got to work with, they’ll find signal in that noise even if there isn’t any signal to find. They try and shoehorn these random flickers into the experiential database. Same reason we see faces in clouds.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31"><a class="calibre21"></a>That’s what I thought those visions were, when they first started coming over the feeds. Just static. So I laid some dynamic filters over them, just to try and clean up the signal, and wouldn’t you know the residuals weren’t random. There was a whole other AV track embedded in there, and holy shit the things it showed.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Fragments, mainly. A few seconds, maybe the longest was getting up around a minute. Glimpses of the inside of some weird gloomy structure, blue end of the spectrum, like it was deep underwater or way out around Neptune or something. Architecture. Machinery. Some kind of twisted plumbing everywhere, all tangled and messed up. Not human, though. Not even close.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">One fragment looked like a cross between a junkyard and a museum, full of things that had to be vehicles. Another looked like some kind of lab, Ceph running around everywhere, operating various bits of equipment. Not your usual Ceph, though, nothing we’ve seen in Manhattan. Some new geek caste, maybe. I saw a magic mirror once, a swirly portal that looked like some kind of teleportation device. Oh, and I kept seeing constellations: a cluster of blue stars, little sapphire pinpricks connected by a network of dim glowing filaments, rotating in midair. Arranged along the surface of an invisible sphere, you know, like a star globe. Ceph planetarium or something, I thought at first. Saw that track a few times, the suit must’ve had it listed as a favorite. Anyway, you’ve got the files. You must have turned my place inside out by now.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">No comment. Right.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">At first I thought this was all just a contaminant from the suit’s camera feed, right? Quantum echo of old footage, something from archival storage seeping into the signal. You could hardly blame the N2 for springing a leak or two after all the shit it had <a class="calibre21"></a>been through. And it was pretty fucking creepy, I mean finally I’m getting a glimpse of where Prophet’s actually <em class="calibre7">been</em> all those months, and wouldn’t you know he didn’t spend all that time getting pissed in some Taiwanese dive.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">It never occurred to me that Alcatraz would even be aware of it. Even if he called up the cam feed, I’d had to squeeze the signal through a whole shitload of amps and filters to find the embed. Even if he had the wherewithal to do that from his end—which he does not—why would he? I didn’t even mention anything to him at the time. Poor fucker already had his hands full, he didn’t need me freaking him out with the news that his suit was haunted by the previous owner.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">But once I figured out what was going on, I went back and looked at all those other burps and hiccups I’d written off as static the first time around. If there <em class="calibre7">was</em> anything useful in there, I figured I could pass it on. And then I run into that hive sequence, you know, the logs from when Hargreave was leading him around by the nose, and the only way that makes any sense at all is if Alcatraz <em class="calibre7">already knows</em> this shit. I mean, you must’ve seen the feed, right? He plays those Ceph controls like a fucking maestro, things I’d never have even tagged <em class="calibre7">as</em> controls. And sure enough, just before he pulls those moves out of his ass there’s static on the line, and when I squeeze out the signal it’s Prophet doing the same thing. Alcatraz was just going thou and doing likewise, bra.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">So the suit isn’t just leaking these signals into the camera feed. It must be laying those images right across Alky’s visual cortex, poking those voxels the way you’d light up an LED. Far as I can figure the brain feed was the main feed; what I was getting off the camera was just an induction leak or something.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31"><a class="calibre21"></a>Now, I’m not saying Alcatraz is hiding anything, you understand? I know you fuckers, I know that’s the first place you’re gonna go with this, but most of the inputs our brains operate on are subconscious. You’re thinking <em class="calibre7">Oooh, Alcatraz was seeing movies in his brain</em> but for all we know he’s not even aware of the stimulus. It might all operate below the level of conscious perception, he could just get a <em class="calibre7">feeling</em> that this is how you’re supposed to work this or that control. So you might want to go easy on the poor bastard, unless you’ve started beating the shit out of people for having flashes of intuition.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">You want something to blame, blame the N2. But really, it was only doing what it was supposed to. It’s programmed for mission success, right? It’s designed to analyze data from a thousand sources, figure out what’s most mission-relevant, serve up the intel most vital to current objectives. That’s all it was doing. That’s all it’s ever done.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">We just had no idea it was going to be so goddamn <em class="calibre7">good</em> at it.</p></blockquote>
</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">You ever have any direct dealings with Jack Hargreave, Roger?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Well of course you wouldn’t have actually <em class="calibre7">met</em>. I’m asking if you ever got into a conversation with the man: text chat, Third Life, online chess club. That sort of thing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Ah. Then you may not know that he liked to play things <em class="calibre7">really</em> close to the chest.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I was halfway through the sequence before I knew what I was actually doing, and even then it wasn’t because Hargreave let me in on his master plan. I was just kick-starting these damn spokes, one after another, fighting off grunts and stalkers every goddamn step of the way, and I basically put it together myself. We’re priming the pump, right? We’re booting up this spire to shoot <a class="calibre21"></a>a huge wadge of spore all over central Manhattan, which on the face of it doesn’t make a lot of sense if you’re actually fighting for the home team. But I remember what Hargreave said, that one insight Nathan Gould’s synapses were too drug-addled to parse: The suit doesn’t contain the specs for a weapon, the suit <em class="calibre7">is</em> the weapon. And the suit, it’s pirated, right? It’s Cephtech on a leash. And I’m remembering that first stalker, my hand going into whatever goo those fuckers use for blood, and the N2 trying to <em class="calibre7">interface</em> with it …</p>
<p class="calibre20">So finally I figure it out. The suit is a weapon. The suit is a <em class="calibre7">virus</em>—Prophet said as much before he blew his brains out and left me holding the bag. And Jack Hargreave, he’s the tenth-degree goddamn black belt in battlefield judo, he’s the absolute master at using your opponent’s strength against him. So I’m wearing a virus, and all this spore, and the spear over my head—that’s the <em class="calibre7">delivery platform</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Simple, huh?</p>
<p class="calibre20">But you’re not gonna get a tight-ass like Hargreave to just come right out and <em class="calibre7">explain</em> it like that, are you? No sirree. That dude learned decades before you and I were even born that Knowledge Is Power. He’s been keeping his cards facedown for so long that I bet even spilling the time of day would make his shriveled little testicles crawl back up into his body.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Still. I figured it out, in between fighting off aliens and fucking with the plumbing. And now I’m standing there with Ceph bodies bleeding out all around me, spore flowing full-bore from all three substations, and Hargreave says: “Now we need to get you inside the central structure.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not like there’s a door in the base of the spear with a neon sign saying <span><span class="calibre9">THIS WAY TO THE INNER WORKINGS</span></span>. Hargreave suggests that I just blow the shit out of it—“Try to blast loose one of the spoke seals and use the resulting rupture to effect entry” is the way he puts it—and that seems kind of ham-fisted even to me, <a class="calibre21"></a>but I don’t have a better idea. So I line up an overhead joint that’s bleeding steam where spear meets spoke—must have taken a hit during the fighting—and I force-feed it a couple of sticky grenades from the L-TAG, praying to the goddamn Spaghetti Monster I’m not punching through a motherboard.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Boom.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The dust clears instantly, sucked into the hole I’ve just blown. Huh. Negative-pressure differential. This thing <em class="calibre7">breathes</em>. The tracheotomy wound is just big enough to let me squeeze inside, where I find—</p>
<p class="calibre20">—well, <em class="calibre7">tentacles</em> is what they look like.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s a kind of silo. Curved glassy panels on all sides, arteries of orange lava-light running vertically between them. I follow those arteries up along a vertical shaft ribbed with cross-bracing every ten or fifteen meters, like hoops of cartilage around a trachea. High up in that space lightning flickers: some kind of static discharge. Even higher: daylight.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But down here in the basement, spore seethes behind those transparent panels as if it were alive. As if it were really pissed off.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave says I have to get it from <em class="calibre7">in there</em> to <em class="calibre7">out here</em>. No obvious controls, no obvious hatches or access ports. No way through except, well, <em class="calibre7">through</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hey, it worked last time.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So I proceed to shoot the shit out of those panels, and the machinery<em class="calibre7">—screams</em> …</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know how else to describe it. Maybe it’s an alarm, maybe it’s just the equivalent of metal fatigue, some kind of mechanical stress. Or maybe Ceph machinery <em class="calibre7">is</em> alive somehow, maybe I’m <em class="calibre7">hurting</em> it. Anyhow, it works: The air around me is thick with spore, I can barely see my hand in front of my face. Hargreave makes approving noises from the ass end of nowhere.</p>
<p class="calibre20">SECOND writes across my eyeballs—</p>
<div class="calibre28"><span class="calibre4">
<p class="calibre33"><a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">Incoming Protocols Detected</em><br class="calibre8"/><em class="calibre7">Handshaking …</em><br class="calibre8"/><em class="calibre7">Handshaking …</em><br class="calibre8"/><em class="calibre7">Connected</em>.<br class="calibre8"/><em class="calibre7">Compiling Interface</em>.</p><div class="calibre6"> </div>
</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">—and even throws up a little progress bar so I can see Hargreave’s science fair project edging toward the blue ribbon. Little patches of orange light flicker across my forearms—some kind of photic interface—and for a moment there it almost looks as though we’re going to pull it off.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But then I guess the spore remembers: It eats backbones like me for lunch. And if we’re a little too tough to chew, it spits us out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something throws me against the wall. I rattle around on the floor for a moment like a pebble in a pickup; then the spire opens its throat and shoots me halfway to the goddamn jet stream. Suddenly my guts are in my boots; all I see is orange streaks and dark blurs. And then I’m <em class="calibre7">out</em>, the human spitball, shot into the sky like a watermelon seed. I hang there in midair for a moment, a tabletop Manhattan turning on all sides, God’s own middle finger jabbing up at me from a dark gray pit dead below. Then I’m coming back to earth and one hard fucking landing. I land back on the spire ass-first and off-center, like dropping onto a free-fall waterslide. I roll, bounce off into space again, grab some bit of alien corkscrew plumbing my body somehow knew was there even though my brain didn’t see it. I hang on for dear life: bait on a hook, thirty stories up. One precious handhold away from street pizza.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Ah,” Hargreave says with mild disappointment. “More resistance than I expected.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">You’ve got to be fucking kidding.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“An immune reaction, I suppose you could call it. You’d better—uh—</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“Just hang on a sec,” he says, and drops off the channel. He’s probably not even being ironic. Either way, fuck <em class="calibre7">that</em> advice: I haul myself back up onto the rim that bounced my ass off the spire, climb back up the vent as far as the slope will let me, scope out the angles. Just off to the left a twisted strip of some avenue ramps up from the ground like a ski jump, a tangle of I-beams and blacktop pushed into space by the erupting spear. It’s close enough to make a jump, if I can get a running start.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I make it, barely. Lose my footing on the very first step, stumble, keep going three long loping steps down a forty-degree angle and push off into space, flailing like an idiot. But I make the jump and land on solid asphalt, in no more pieces than I was before.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I start down the road to ground level. I’m almost there when static cackles in my ear and Hargreave’s back. There’s nothing fake about his tone this time. I can tell with his first word that he’s stressed; I can tell by the second that he’s scared shitless.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He tells me the Pentagon has decided on drastic measures. He tells me bombers are inbound from McGuire.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He tells me they’re going to put all of Lower Manhattan underwater.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_28"></div>
