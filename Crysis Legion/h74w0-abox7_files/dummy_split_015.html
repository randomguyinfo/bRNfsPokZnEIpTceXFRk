<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre29">Dear Neville,</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">I hope our Lord is keeping you safe in these most trying of times. I have tried to contact you through more conventional means but the network has been down for some time in Manhattan and now my batteries have died. I have resorted to the old-fashioned methods our ancient brethren used, in the days before the technophiles and idolaters seduced us with their global networks and their Internet pornography (although I must admit that I find myself missing the satellite feed and Prayer Line that funds our ministry. Praise the Lord, who turns the Devil’s own tools to such righteous ends!).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">It is day four and our mission here is beginning to make progress, although perhaps more slowly than I would have hoped. New York was full of wickedness even <em class="calibre7">before</em> the End Days began, which is of course why Satan chose it as his first stronghold (though I admit I would have expected him to start with Los Angeles or Fergus). Communists and sodomites are almost as thick upon the ground here as demons, and while recent events have caused many of the locals to repent, others even <a class="calibre21"></a>now resist our attempts to lead them to salvation (none so blind as those who will not see). Those damnable Anglicans, sensing an opportunity to spread their particular brand of liberalism, have also set up shop on the other side of the borough; many survivors encounter them first, and desperate for even the appearance of redemption, are fooled by their use of Christian props. I hear that even the ragheads have regrouped at a mosque over in Hamilton Heights! Fortunately they are wasting their time by launching jihad against Satan’s armies instead of converting souls (they know the easier enemy to beat when they see it, ha ha!), and we have had no direct encounters with them so far.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Our greatest enemy, of course, is Satan himself. You may have heard mention of “the Rapture” on the mainstream feeds; do not be fooled. It is anything but. I have seen these so-called Raptured with my own eyes. They are <em class="calibre7">infested</em>, brother. They seek the light, but it is not the light of our Lord (you may remember that <em class="calibre7">Lucifer</em> means “bringer of light”). Some kind of demonic tumors grow in their eyes, in their mouths, in their open wounds. It steals away their souls. They are <em class="calibre7">already</em> saved, they say. They have <em class="calibre7">already</em> found redemption. And they are gripped by some evil wanderlust that draws them to wherever Satan’s spawn gather in the greatest numbers.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">And there is something else, Neville, something new. You may have heard of the “pingers” and the “stalkers” and the other abominations that walk these streets, preying on sinners and saved alike. I have seen them with my own eyes; they are half flesh and half machine and not remotely human. But just today I saw something that <a class="calibre21"></a>looked and moved like a man, yet was as depraved as any demon. I saw a ghoul, feeding on the flesh of the dead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">It was the color of stone, or clay. For a few moments I thought it might be one of those golems the Jews go on about—they do figure prominently in Revelation, even though they have spurned Christ—but it had metal seams and joints, and a head like a helmet. And its <em class="calibre7">body</em>, Neville, it had such muscles, they shone and rippled and flexed with every movement. I swear, were it not the color of slate it might almost have been you standing there, in the shower at the seminary after practice. But it acted nothing like you, Neville. It was crouched over a pile of corpses and it <em class="calibre7">fed</em> on them through some kind of fang or needle that sprouted from its wrist. I did not get close enough to see the details, but those penetrated bodies—they shriveled up as I watched, Neville. This monster sucked them dry and left nothing but husks of skin draped over bone, like one of the steel vermin that scuttle about these streets draining the dead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">I was transfixed. And before I could recover my wits, this thing turned and looked straight at me. Its face—the air was full of smoke and there was maybe half a city block between us, but I could see that it had red eyes, or maybe just a single great eye. It stood up, still facing me; it must have been nine or ten feet tall. It took a step toward me. I held up my Bible, Neville, I was terrified but I had faith in Our Lord, I held up the Bible to this abomination and it stopped! It just stood there for a moment, watching me, and then—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">And then it <em class="calibre7">laughed</em>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31"><a class="calibre21"></a>It had the strangest laugh, Neville. It didn’t sound anything like a real voice, it sounded like some kind of primitive machine from the last century.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">And it began to move again, toward me.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">I confess my faith failed me then. I turned and fled. I must have run for blocks, and when I finally stopped and looked behind me it was nowhere to be seen.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Perhaps it was a golem after all. Perhaps it was the Beast himself that I saw, feasting on fallen souls. I do not know. But it had the shape of a man and the aspect of the Enemy; and while I’ve seen the Devil’s other soldiers wreak much greater destruction, there was something especially <em class="calibre7">intimate</em> about the evil this thing wrought in the streets of this accursed place. Don’t ask me how I know, but I feel in my soul that this ghoul was the most wicked, the most evil of all the satanic forces I have seen here. I pray I never encounter its like again.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">But enough darkness! There is so much comfort to be had even in the face of these abominations—for they prove, once and for all, that we were right and the atheist liberals were wrong. The Devil’s minions are everywhere, just as the Scriptures foretold. It is truly a joyous time (perhaps not for the abortionists and the unbelievers—who’s laughing <em class="calibre7">now</em>, Dr. Meyers? ha ha!). The coming of our Lord is at hand.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">One of CELL’s Christian soldiers has promised to scan this letter to you as soon as he is able. God bless CELL; they are truly doing the Lord’s work. Perhaps once they <a class="calibre21"></a>vanquish the Devil’s Armies they can do something about the homosexuals, ha ha!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Be well, and rejoice. The Lord is with us always.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Yours in Christ,</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Franklin</p></blockquote>
</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">What? You think this thing powers <em class="calibre7">itself</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre20">You think I can leap between rooftops, roll Bulldogs single-handed, throw CELL drones around like kittens without draining the batteries? Have you even read the damn <em class="calibre7">specs</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Everything about this suit is a trade-off. You can crank the armor so tight you’re pretty much invincible, but only for a few seconds and you cut your speed in half. You can disappear entirely, just fade right out of the visible spectrum, but the lensing field sucks so much juice the capacitors run dry before you’re halfway down the block. And don’t even <em class="calibre7">talk</em> to me about trying to do any of those things at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They don’t mention any of that in the ad copy, of course. To hear the brochure tell it, you just put on the N2 and hit the ground at sixty, invisible and invulnerable, world without end a-fucking-men. But all those bells and whistles take <em class="calibre7">power</em>—and the suit may be a hundred years ahead of its time, but the batteries? Let me tell you, sometimes it feels like this thing’s running on a couple of triple-A’s.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They say it keeps you going under normal conditions for almost a week without a recharge. I don’t have to tell you conditions are anything but <em class="calibre7">normal</em> out there. I tapped into the grid on those rare occasions when I could find a grid to tap into. Even then, it was even money whether I’d be able to suck up a decent charge before the extra load blew the breakers over ten city blocks.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>The suit’s got a NOM option to metabolize carrion on the battlefield. Cellular ATP gives you almost sixty kilojoules per mole, and that’s not even counting bomb-cal content of the raw meat. So, yeah. I used it once or twice, to keep myself going. I fed off the dead like a fucking tick, and I’m not proud of it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Still, you can’t deny it makes sense. The grid may go down, clouds may cut you off from your solar sats—but the one thing you’ll never run out of down here is bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Gould isn’t gone. I’m starting to get the sense that Gould is never gone, not really. He’s like one of those mutant unkillable STDs you pick up out in the Gene Zone: Just when you think you’re finally free of it, your dick starts oozing again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He pops back onto my comm channel as if the dustup at his apartment had never happened, bursting with good news he’s skimmed from forbidden frequencies: some kind of field hospital set up at Trinity. He figures that was where CELL planned to “debrief” Prophet. The good news is that hardware designed to interface with all the suit’s black boxes is pretty much a given.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“The bad news,” he says, “is that we’re going to have to storm the post.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He actually says <em class="calibre7">we</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I’m already halfway there,” he tells me. “The Harley doesn’t give a flying fuck about rocks in the road, I can thread this thing through a gutter pipe if I have to. I’ll wait for you there, but you gotta haul ass.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I went to church religiously until I was fourteen. Never liked it much. Don’t expect to like it much now but I make the trip, find a decent vantage point to scope out the territory: a midrise apartment complex that looks like it’s been derelict since the Double Dip. The top floor gives me a perfect vantage point: Trinity’s steeple reaches up from across Broadway, a great stone dildo with <a class="calibre21"></a>a thousand ribs and projections urging the Incredible Fifty-Foot Woman to let go. The main entrance is a two-story arch, deep in shadow; but I have no trouble making out the two CELL grunts slouching in the shade.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I zoom the view and pan the terrain. Gould guesses the entrance is going to be rotten with motion sensors and smart guns and he’s right about that: I make three autosnipes in addition to the two hamburgers at the front before someone emerges from inside. The hamburgers jump instantly to attention. I prick up my ears, too: It’s—</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Sweet smoking Jesus, that’s Tara Strickland,” Gould says. “Used to be a Navy SEAL, went over to CELL after her father died. Try not to get killed by her. Try not to kill her, either; she’s big fish, she’s the goddamn Rosetta Stone if we can get her to talk.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">She’s talking now, tearing a strip off the grunts for slouching in a war zone. Then she disappears back inside, leaving her minions standing a lot straighter.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Now, <em class="calibre7">those</em> assholes?” Gould says. “You can kill ’em all you want.”</p>
<p class="calibre27">So I do. Three shots total. Then I take out the smart guns. Two other hamburgers come charging out of the shadows and decide, too late, that discretion is sometimes the better part of valor. I take one of them out with a single shot; the other gets to cover behind a Ford pickup whose front bumper is festooned with the smiling face of Osama bin Laden and the words <span><span class="calibre9">I’M STILL FREE: HOW ABOUT YOU?</span></span> He knows he can’t get back to sanctuary without taking a bullet; he knows, as my grenade arcs down on top of him, that he can’t stay where he is. He bolts at the last second for an ad-infested bus stop shelter, manages one panicked yelp before the grenade goes off. He dies by the light of a flaming advertisement <a class="calibre21"></a>for Carmat Artificial Kidneys (<span><span class="calibre9">ISN’T</span></span>
<em class="calibre7">Y<span><span class="calibre9">OUR</span></span></em>
<span><span class="calibre9">LIFE WORTH THE PRICE?</span></span>).</p>
<p class="calibre20">I hit the stairwell and take the stairs ten at a time, make ground level in thirty seconds flat without hearing any rotors overhead, any boots below. I’m not quite sure I believe it; shouldn’t there be an assault helicopter coming over the rooftops by now? Shouldn’t someone be wondering why Asswipe Seven hasn’t called in? I can’t hear anything except this little voice in my head chuckling over the fact that we can’t even stop killing each other when we’re being invaded by space aliens.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s funny, you know, because it’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I peek out, pan on zoom, again on thermal. I pull up my cloak and cross the street; I’m still half expecting a hail of heavenly lead but I don’t run into so much as a stop sign. I reach the bodies I’ve laid out across the asphalt, rob them of firepower and ammo that did them no fucking good whatsoever. I take some comfort in the knowledge that I will put it all to better use. I decloak in the shadows, let the charge build back up, fade again. Push one of those massive doors open just a little—solid bronze, I think, they looked like they were a couple of hundred years old—and sneak into God’s House like a shadow on its stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And still nobody’s drawn any kind of bead on me. There’s nobody even here as far as I can tell. So I stand up and I look around, and—</p>
<p class="calibre20">And holy shit, Roger. It’s <em class="calibre7">beautiful</em>. It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know if I can even describe it. One second you’re in the middle of a post-apocalyptic wasteland and the next you’re on the floor of this great golden cavern, it’s dimly lit but somehow you can see everything even without the augments. You’d swear the ceiling reaches halfway to the stars; it rests on massive arches topped by these glorious stained-glass windows and they aren’t <a class="calibre21"></a>even broken, Roger, I swear not a single one of them is even <em class="calibre7">scratched</em>. The seats, the benches, what do they call those—yeah, the pews. Those have been ripped out. And sure enough a field hospital’s been set up in their place but even that’s gone now, nothing left but a few rows of stripped cots and a pile of empty crates with red crosses on them. The arches tower over everything like redwood trunks from the eighteen hundreds, you know, you see pictures online sometimes. And way off at the front behind the pulpit, about halfway up the wall are rows of life-sized statues in little alcoves, saints or martyrs or something. And towering over <em class="calibre7">that</em> there’s this enormous mother of all stained-glass windows: wide as any church I’ve ever seen, and twice as high, a great arch that’s <em class="calibre7">all one window</em> full of a hundred colors and a thousand facets. Must be five, six stories high and the colors are so rich they almost hurt my eyes, I almost forgot we <em class="calibre7">had</em> colors like that in the world. The light’s almost—I don’t know. Divine.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I feel like an ant in a kaleidoscope. I swear to God, Roger, that church was so much bigger on the inside, we could pack the whole city in there if we tried. And there’s more than enough room, because I’m the only one there. No CELL grunts, no whitecoats running around with beeping boxes, no hard-ass ex-navy bitches waiting to feed me my balls on a platter. I pump up the acoustics, I zoom every shadow, and there’s nothing but this insane, beautiful pocket universe I’ve stumbled into. I just want to stay there and let Armageddon go on without me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">No chance of that, of course. Because here comes Nathan Gould roaring up outside on his motorbike and he comes stomping into the place like a fucking barbarian. I don’t think he even <em class="calibre7">notices</em> the windows. He looks around and sees nothing, kicks one of the cots. “Shit. We’re too late.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">But he gives it the once-over anyway, starts poking around the desks and the tables up front, and the spell’s broken so I figure I <a class="calibre21"></a>might as well join him. After a few minutes he lets loose a whoop and holds up a sheaf of papers like it was the head of a vanquished enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“They’ve relocated!” he says. “Moved across the way to Wall Street, looks like. Closer to the trunk line.” He jerks his chin at that magnificent windowed wall. “Down in the basement, under the stairwell. There’s an access tunnel, goes under the street. I can hack the security codes, but there’s bound to be muscle. What we need—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He looks around, and nods to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“—is a diversion.”</p>

<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Time/Date of Incident: 23/08/2023</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Nature of Incident: Security Breach</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Location: Field Interrogation Facility, Wall Street, Manhattan</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">CELL Personnel Present: C. Abao, S.-H. Chen, H. Kumala, D. Lockhart, M. Parpek, B. Rawles, T. Strickland, L. deWinter</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Others Present: N. Gould, Unknown</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Reporting Participant: deWinter</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Account of Incident:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">I was carrying out duties assigned by CO Lockhart (installing/prepping NODAR interface for debriefing incoming rogue agent) along with Chen, Lieutenant Kumala, Parpek, and Dr. Rawles, when the incident occurred. We were operating in an active combat zone but we were guarded by at least 14 active CELL paramilitary both during initial deployment at Trinity and subsequent relocation. At approximately 1300 I <a class="calibre21"></a>overheard Kumala speaking to Special Adviser Strickland on encrypted channel. SA Strickland reported that the rogue operative had been sighted in the area and would be in custody soon. We therefore booted up NODAR and began ground-truthing sims. (We had to do this three times because of intermittent power failures during the first sequences, before Chen got a generator from the trailers.)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Shortly after this SA Strickland entered the facility via the underground entrance and had words with Lt. Kumala. She seemed to be angrier than usual (I think she was unhappy with the soldiers guarding the facility but I did not hear any details). SA Strickland stayed on-site for perhaps five minutes, during which time she approached me and asked if the equipment was ready. I told her that we would be ready shortly (we were still running the third ground-truthing sequence). This did not seem to be the answer SA Strickland was hoping for. At this point Lt. Kumala approached SA Strickland and reported that there appeared to be “a problem” with the guards stationed at Trinity. SA Strickland then assembled a small force (maybe 3 or 4 soldiers) and left through the Trinity tunnel. Before she left she told Lt. Kumala to reassign snipers to the roof because “Prophet won’t be thinking as two-dimensionally as you lot.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Parpek and I completed the ground-truthing sequences during this time but then Dr. Rawles tripped over the power cord so we had to start again. While we were reinitializing the NODAR the ground began to shake and I heard what sounded like a muffled explosion in the distance. (I believe this was the ammo dump going up in the churchyard.) I noticed Lt. Kumala becoming agitated over at his command post. He then approached the technical team and said <a class="calibre21"></a>something like “He’s here. He’s right outside. Get that f______g machine working already or I’ll feed your nads to Hargreave myself.” Lt. Kumala then took the rest of his forces and left via the main entrance.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">At this point only Abao, Chen, Parpek, Dr. Rawles, and myself were in the room and none of us were armed. We could hear gunfire and shouting from outside. Dr. Rawles suggested that we might be safer if we moved up the tunnel into Trinity but Abao pointed out that the trouble seemed to have started at Trinity so we decided we would be better off where we were. Chen locked the tunnel door.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">The gunfire and the shouting trailed off while we were talking. I heard someone crying, and a single shot, and then two sets of footsteps coming up the tunnel. I heard a voice on the other side of the door but I couldn’t hear the words. Then the door unlocked from the other side and a male civilian weelding [<em class="calibre7">sic</em>] a gun entered from the tunnel (I learned later that this was Nathan Gould, an ex-employee of CryNet). Abao asked the civilian not to shoot and the civilian said he wanted to do a suit scan. Parpek was at the telemetry panel and I saw him mouth the word <em class="calibre7">cloak</em> but then there was a gunshot and Parpek was hit in the chest. At this point a second intruder became visible and I could see he was wearing a CryNet Systems Nanosuit either 2.0 or 2.2, it’s hard to tell without checking the neuropticals. (I learned later that this was “Prophet,” the rogue we were supposed to be debriefing.) He was also holding some kind of pistol, I think maybe an M12, and he had a machine gun strapped to his belt, too, although it was not deployed. Chen promised we would not make any trouble, but Dr. Rawles had been standing behind the door and he came at <a class="calibre21"></a>“Prophet” from behind. (He had a dynaport multitool in his hand, so he may have been trying to short out the Nanosuit through the cervical interface.) “Prophet” pointed the gun in Dr. Rawles’s face and Dr. Rawles backed away. Dr. Gould said something like “I asked you not to shoot the geeks” but “Prophet” had stopped shooting by this point anyway. I thought I saw a tic in the forearm musculature so it could have just been temporary spindle lock.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Gould then directed us at gunpoint to hook the rogue up to the NODAR, which we did. Chen handled biotelemetry and I ran the suit diagnostics. I was parsing the twitch protocols when Chen said “F_____k, he’s <em class="calibre7">dead.”</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Gould threatened Chen and told her not to make threats she couldn’t back up, but Chen explained that the rogue was actually, literally <em class="calibre7">dead</em>. I accessed his vitals myself at that point and confirmed this. The right ventricle and left lung were gone and his right lung was relatively intact but nonfunctional due to pneumothorax. I could see that the right lung might be salvageable (the diaphragm had been perforated but the N2 had infiltrated the injuries with a synthomyosin mesh that was restoring some integrity), but the rest of the thoracic cluster was just gone. The N2 had bypassed the pulmonary system entirely and was infusing O<sub class="calibre46"><span class="calibre4">2</span></sub> directly into the aortic arch. I also noticed that it had extruded synthomyosin around the shrapnel and it had coated all the torn internal surfaces with anafibrin, but none of these were stand-alone modifications. The N2 extended into its wearer at the molecular level and had taken over most of the vital processes, so Chen was medically right. The undamaged tissues left inside the suit did not meet the definition of a complete viable organism <a class="calibre21"></a>as defined by National Health Industry Standards. “Prophet” was legally dead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">I watched for some kind of reaction to that news, but he kept his visor locked the whole time and I could not see his face. I did not notice any obvious change in body language. I think maybe he knew already.</p></blockquote>
</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">How did I feel? How did I <em class="calibre7">feel</em>? How do you <em class="calibre7">think</em> I fucking felt?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Betrayed. That’s how.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I knew it was bad, of course. I knew I was dead the moment that gunship hit me on Battery Park. But then, Prophet, yo? My hope and my salvation. This Lazarus suit, this second chance. I didn’t know if it was actually fixing me or just keeping me going until the guys at Syracuse could put me back together but I always thought that if I made it out of the battle zone alive I’d at least get a chance to step out in my own skin, you know? I thought, somewhere down the road, I’d be human again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But all the suicidal thoughts and the despair over my lost humanity, none of that really gets a chance to sink in at first—because I’m still trying to parse the fact that the N2 just mutinied on me, that it actually froze my goddamn finger on the trigger and scolded me for killing “mission-critical collaborators.” I’ve already taken out the lab rat who tried to hack me on remote but there are still four other <em class="calibre7">potential enemy combatants</em> in the room, as they say. And the suit—the fucking <em class="calibre7">suit</em>—is telling me I can’t eliminate those threats.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But then I hear what one of those techs has just told Gould—</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m dead.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m <em class="calibre7">dead</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">—and suddenly, crazily, I actually <em class="calibre7">feel</em> dead. I could swear that up until this very moment I’ve felt the air flowing in and out <a class="calibre21"></a>of my chest; when those Ceph came through the wall, when I tangled with the mercs outside, I felt my pulse pound. It’s not something you think about consciously but it’s damn well the kind of thing you notice when it’s gone, right? And I haven’t noticed anything missing until right now, until the moment that tech with the V-gloves says, “No, he’s <em class="calibre7">literally dead</em>,” and just like that all those comforting biorhythms I thought had been keeping me company all this time, they just drain away. I reach for a pulse and find nothing. I try to catch my breath and I can’t. And all I feel in that instant is this crazy gobsmacked astonishment that all those things have gone and left nothing behind and I <em class="calibre7">never even noticed</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And the next thing I feel is a rising, murderous fury at Nathan fucking Gould.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Because Gould scanned me, just a couple of hours ago. Sure his rig didn’t come with all the latest bells and whistles but it sure as shit should’ve been able to tell when someone’s <em class="calibre7">dead</em>, you know? It sure as shit should be able to tell you when your goddamn <em class="calibre7">heart</em> is missing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould, you fucker. You slimy, sorry sack of shit. You <em class="calibre7">knew</em>. You knew all along, and you let me do your dirty work, and you never even <em class="calibre7">told</em> me, Gould, you never even—</p>
<p class="calibre20">I swear I’m going to break his scrawny pencil neck but I’m locked down in the cradle. I can’t do anything but listen to the lab rats talking over me like I’m fungus in a petri dish. Gould couldn’t give two shits about my injuries, he just wants to know what the N2’s holding in its deep-layer substrate. The technician tells him they’re uploading it as fast as they can, and they’re all pointedly ignoring the body twitching at the corner of my eye. And that twitching, it doesn’t stop. It actually gets worse over time and its not just the body anymore it’s the things around it, it’s the very <em class="calibre7">air</em> and I’m trying to turn my head for a better look and no dice—I’m still wired into the harness—but that’s okay <a class="calibre21"></a>because that weird shimmery twitchiness is spreading across my visual field like water spilled across the floor, like the ground racing up at you when your stabilizers are down and you’re coming in too fast—</p>
<p class="calibre20">I think it short-circuits me, somehow. The cradle. Knocks me right out of the here-and-now and right into some, some—I don’t know. Some schizophrenic’s nightmare. I can hardly see anything, just shapes and silhouettes stuck in shades of blue and black like I’m in some kind of subterranean grotto. Giant machines everywhere. At least I think they’re machines, judging by their outlines. And there are things all over them, crawling down the walls, slithering along the floor. Coming for me. The monsters are coming and I’m stuck in molasses, I’ve got a gun but I barely even have the strength to bring it up much less defend myself.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Pretty classic nightmare scenario, right? Looking back now I figure maybe some kind of voltage spike when the cradle linked in, maybe it kick-started that part of the brain that lights up when you’re scared shitless. Limbic system, I think they call it. The amygdala. But I’m not thinking about any of that in the moment, I’m just terrified, and then—you’re not gonna believe it, but suddenly, just like that, I’m <em class="calibre7">happy</em>. You know why?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Because I can feel my heart beating again. I can hear my breath, harsh and ragged and <em class="calibre7">fast</em> because I’m scared, man, I’m still so scared but there’s also this huge sense of relief, of <em class="calibre7">joy</em> almost. I’m real again, I’m alive. I <em class="calibre7">feel</em> alive. As if this is the world and I’ve just awakened from the nightmare.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then this nasty little voice in the back of my head says, <em class="calibre7">No, soldier, that’s not your pulse. That’s not your breath. These aren’t even your eyes, you corpse, you meat sack, you miserable rotting zombie. They’re Prophet’s. Everything’s Prophet’s</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">You stole it all</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then some other voice says <em class="calibre7">It’s spiking</em> and someone else says <em class="calibre7">lookit those fucking delta waves</em> and now the nightmare’s leaking <a class="calibre21"></a>back into the dream, the monsters are fading and real people are yelling in the distance, spoiling everything. The world turns back to shit and I can feel my breath disappearing, my arms and legs turning to dead meat, and all I can think of as I fall back to earth is Prophet, poor ol’ Prophet, and the last thing he said before he blew his brains out: <em class="calibre7">Remember me</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Remember you?</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not like I have a fucking choice.</p>
<p class="calibre27">And here I am again, dead, paralyzed, surrounded by lab rats and liars arguing over how best to carve me up for the data in my guts.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Except things seem to be going a lot worse for them than last time I checked in.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The light’s gone longwave. Sparks pop like fireworks. Half the boxes hooked into my cradle are smoking; the other half are alive with machine code. I can see the script scrolling up across techie faces, I can zoom in and see warning icons reflected in their eyes. And those eye are wide, lemme tell you. Those eyes are scared shitless.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Someone shouts “Overload!” and a very calm machine voice answers <em class="calibre7">Uncalibrated nano-routines detected. Alien tissue vector. Thirty-three percent</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“It’s online,” bleats the rat who pronounced me dead. “It’s <em class="calibre7">transmitting …</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould: “Shut it down!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I’m <em class="calibre7">trying</em> …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">In the distance, the sound of rotors beating the air. The sound of boots moving with <em class="calibre7">authority</em>. Suddenly someone else is in the room, scaring back the lab rats, grabbing Gould by the scruff of the neck and smashing his face into the wall. Gould goes down like a priest on a choirboy; the intruder turns to me and smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Lockhart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Suddenly things are very quiet. The rotors outside have spun down. The local hardware has stopped sizzling; one of the techs must have succeeded in shutting it off before Lockhart scared them all into the corner. None of the usual trash talk from the mercs who’ve flooded the room in their master’s wake. The room pulses with dim red emergency lighting, but the alarms have fallen silent.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But there’s Lockhart, with a gun in his hand. Smiling through the glass.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I try to move; no dice. I’m Christ on the cross in this thing. I can’t even access my tacticals.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Lockhart moseys past the observation port, steps into my cage. His sleeves are rolled halfway up the biceps. The camo pattern on his CELL fatigues is a mesh of hexagons, blue-gray, green-gray, brown-gray. Honeycomb, like Prophet’s tattoo. You notice these things at the weirdest times.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Nice,” he says.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Just a light pistol, the M12 Nova. You never really appreciate how big it is until you have one jammed in your face.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">I’m going to die</em>, I think, and then, <em class="calibre7">No</em>. Gould’s going to die, maybe. Maybe even the lab techs, if Lockhart’s a stickler for loose ends. But not me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m already dead. I’m already dead. I’ve been dead all day.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Lockhart leans in close. “Got men all over the downtown looking for your ass, tin man. And here you are, trussed and tied.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Which takes his threat potential down to zero, I’m thinking. Which means that pulling that trigger makes you a murderer. Not to mention a war criminal.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Tara Strickland, in the flesh and the nick of time. She gestures at the floor: a couple of CELLulites haul Nathan Gould to his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>I can’t help noticing that Lockhart’s gun is still in my face. Tara Strickland, no slouch herself, notices, too. “Commander Lockhart. <em class="calibre7">You will stand down.</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He doesn’t want to. He hates this uppity bitch who thinks she can order him around, he hates the fucking Rules of Engagement, he hates me most of all.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But he stands down.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Strickland’s already moved on to other things. “Nathan Gould. Always a pleasure.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Jesus, Tara.” Gould shakes his head and sighs. “Working with these assholes? If your father could see you now.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“My father’s dead, Nathan,” she says mildly, and graces him with a gentle smile: “Now why don’t you shut the fuck up before I change my mind and send you after him?” She nods at one of the goons holding him up. “If he gives you trouble, don’t do too much damage. We’ll need to interrogate him later.” Back to Lockhart: “Power him down.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">She tosses him a matte-black gizmo the size of a sixty-round casket box. The moment he slaps it against my helmet, I see double: two fuzzy overlapping Lockharts snarling at my side, two Stricklands leading two Goulds out through two sets of security doors. The world slides in and out of focus. A swarm of bees buzzes in my right ear.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Get up.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The cradle releases me. I stand, or try to; I almost go over with the first step. I force my eyes to focus, and after a moment my worlds converge. Everything’s still—muted, though. Almost colorless. I feel as weak as a Democrat.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Don’t <em class="calibre7">fuck</em> with me, Prophet. <em class="calibre7">Move.</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">CryNet built this thing, after all. Only makes sense they’d have some kind of off-switch.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_24"></div>
