<p class="calibre16">Viral. That’s the way Prophet put it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know how to put it any better. I can feel it in me now, I can feel it in <em class="calibre7">us:</em> seeking out the old code, shaking its hand, seizing control and changing its mind. Spreading the good news, particle by microscopic particle. It’s changing me from the inside out: the Tunguska Iteration.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The good plague.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe just a dream. I mean really, even with Cephtech, what are the odds that you can <em class="calibre7">feel</em> the reprogramming of individual cells? How is that even possible? Imagination, more likely, fueled by False Prophet murmuring at the back of my head that <em class="calibre7">Nanocatalyst viability assessment is complete</em> and the iteration is <em class="calibre7">ready to deploy</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">All I know is, the feeling fades as I rise from the darkness. I hear other voices, here at the bottom of the river. They’re not loud, but they’re distinct. I can hear them clearly over the hissing of my respirator.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You were CIA all along? Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould <em class="calibre7">again</em>. I swear, that fucker’s got to be my own personal spirit animal.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Give me a fucking break.” Tara Strickland’s down here, too.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Pale daylight filters down through the muddy water. Another glorious Manhattan morning has begun.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“You want to help, help me find this guy,” Strickland says. “You’re so sure he’s the key to all this.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“The <em class="calibre7">suit</em> is. Alcatraz and the suit, together. <em class="calibre7">That’s</em> the weapon.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Ah, Nathan. So near, and yet so far. Would you talk about you <em class="calibre7">and</em> your right arm? Would you talk about Tara Strickland <em class="calibre7">and</em> her spinal cord?</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Uh-huh. Chino—anything?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Nothing, ma’am. Sweep complete. We’re working our way back along the shore.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Chino. Dude. Good to hear your voice.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I roll over. The riverbed slopes upward, bare gray rock, current-scoured.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I don’t think we—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“There! That’s his signal!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“We got him, Chino. Back to the vehicles.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Over here! This way! Over here!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I crawl across the waterline. Gould and Strickland wave down at me from the edge of a torn-up underpass, fissured and buckled. Grids of rebar show through the gaps like sutures. The Queensboro bridge is a tangle of broken Tinkertoy at my back. Behind it, on the far shore, Roosevelt Island smolders like Pompeii after the fireworks.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So much for getting my life back. So much for rising from the dead. Help me, Obi-Wan Hargreave; you were my only hope.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You fucker.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Strickland’s already ringing up the chain of command by the time I jump up to rejoin the home team: Lieutenant Tara Strickland, seconded, special ops. Announcing the Return of the Prodigal Daughter, <em class="calibre7">sir</em>. Would like to go partying with the Ceph at their Central Park HQ. Wanna come?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Colonel Barclay is unconvinced. Much talk of foolish heroics and pointless suicide. Strickland counters by saying that Gould <a class="calibre21"></a>has convinced her we have a real shot at turning this thing around (I couldn’t swear that that was the best approach to take, but at least Barclay doesn’t turn her down flat). Strickland asks for air support; Barclay says he’ll get back to her.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Strickland doesn’t wait for that. We move out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould tries to fill me in on the way. It’s not the smoothest narrative I’ve ever heard, punctuated as it is by <em class="calibre7">uhh</em>s and <em class="calibre7">umm</em>s and <em class="calibre7">Get down get down fucking Squids at nine o’clock!</em>s. But it turns out the N2’s been tightcasting more than basic vitals and GPS coordinates. It’s been reading the voxels in my visual cortex. Or no, that’s not right: It’s been <em class="calibre7">feeding</em> the voxels in my visual cortex, lighting them up like LEDs on a flatscreen display, and that’s just as true for Prophet’s memories as it is for waypoints and weapons specs. And it’s been writing it all to the thirty-gigahertz band as well.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Nathan Gould has been spying on my dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Prophet’s memories have told him more than they’ve told me. They’ve told him that the center of Ceph operations is under the Central Park Reservoir. <em class="calibre7">Isn’t THAT a coincidence</em> I think, and then: <em class="calibre7">Hargreave</em>. Hargreave and his corporations within corporations, their tentacles squirming down through the boardrooms and the back rooms and the generations, the butterfly flaps its wings in 1912 and a hundred years later neither crime nor depression nor all the developers in the world have managed to make a dent in that sacred green space.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What was it Hargreave said to Gould, just before the ceiling crashed in? “You think I’m based in this cesspit city because I <em class="calibre7">like</em> it here?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Think about it, Roger. Think about how <em class="calibre7">old</em> New York is. The Europeans showed up what, five centuries ago? The Amerinds, thousand of years before that. All that time the Ceph have been sleeping under our streets and none of us even knew it. <em class="calibre7">Almost</em>
<a class="calibre21"></a>none of us, at least; down through all those ages I bet at least one or two people must’ve wandered into the wrong cave at the right time, tiptoed among all those sleeping giants, maybe made off with a box of Kleenex or a bedside alarm clock or a fountain of youth.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave was an adult in 1908. I wonder how old he was then. I wonder if Tunguska was really the first time he stole fire from the gods. I’m thinking, what if Hargreave was around back when New York started clearing the squatters out of central Manhattan? What if Hargreave was there in the fifteen-fucking-<em class="calibre7">hundreds</em>, playing his backroom games to make sure that someday the biggest city on the whole damn continent would be sitting on the roof of the Devil’s summer cottage?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I have no idea why, Roger. It’s all just idle speculation bouncing around in the back of a Bulldog on its way to the final showdown. All I’m saying is, maybe Tunguska wasn’t the first time Hargreave got in and got out, and maybe Ling Shan wasn’t the second. Maybe Ling Shan was just the first time the owners woke up and found him in their bedroom.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But like I say, I don’t really get much chance to follow up on any of this because the Ceph keep distracting me. I’ve never seen more than one dropship at a time before: <em class="calibre7">Four</em> of them do a low-altitude flyby over the water before we’re off East River Drive. I’m on the turret but I don’t even try to light them up: they’re going too fast, the ride’s too bumpy for a bead, and I gotta admit a part of me’s hoping that if we don’t draw attention to ourselves they might not notice us, just head off to wherever they’re going and let us get to Central Park in peace.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Then we swing onto 58th and you can see just how fat a chance <em class="calibre7">that</em> was ever gonna be.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The whole damn avenue is crisscrossed with Ceph conduits. They jut up out of the road, arc across five or ten floors of airspace, <a class="calibre21"></a>disappear into holes smashed through storefronts and skyscrapers. The street is a tangle of concrete and uplifted bedrock and giant jagged sawtooth alien plumbing, and as we come around the corner you can see the last of the dropships dumping their cargo in a big nasty line all across First Avenue.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They know we’re coming.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The first two Bulldogs are already jammed up and taking fire; one of them rolled before we rounded the corner and is over on its back, spinning its wheels. I’m doing what I can but East River Drive was smooth as fucking <em class="calibre7">glass</em> next to all this buckled asphalt and my crosshairs are bouncing across ninety degrees of arc until our driver hits the brakes. Except it’s not so much hitting the brakes as getting his rib cage blown to matchsticks by the shell the Ceph just lobbed through his windshield. I bail in the split second before it explodes, which isn’t nearly enough time to get out of the blast radius. Thank Christ for the armor option.</p>
<p class="calibre20">This is resistance like we’ve never seen before. The street ahead is crawling with alien grunts; stalkers leap from wall to wall like giant metal grasshoppers, taking their shots and bouncing away before anyone can get a bead. I count at least four Heavies lumbering up the street; their cannons flash like Gatling guns. Our whole damn convoy is scattered to hell and gone: three vehicles out for the count, their occupants either dead or taking cover; no sign of the others. Hopefully they saw the scoring on the walls and took a less scenic route.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I lose the convoy. They lose me: Too many torqued I-beams and shorting electrical networks to keep in touch over more than a block or two, and oh, here come the pingers. Always the life of the party. But somewhere between the blowing-shit-up and the not-being-blown-to-shit I make it to the upper reaches of a trashed office building. I’m not running away: I’m fighting uphill. Half a dozen Ceph drop modules are embedded way up in <a class="calibre21"></a>the executive levels and the grunts that came out are making the most of the high ground.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Half the fucking floor is in flames by the time we finish mixing it up, but it’s worth it. The altitude gives me my signal back and Barclay’s geek squad has been working overtime: Gould has loaned them my suit freqs and it turns out they can tap into the N2’s targeting subsystems to help pinpoint the air strikes the good colonel has managed to coax out of McGuire. Too little, way too late for most of us: Strickland’s heroic little convoy has been decimated.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not exterminated, though. Not extinct, not yet. A few of us make it through all the way to Central Park.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Or as your friends at the Pentagon prefer to call it: Ground Zero.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Now, from the folks who brought you <em class="calibre7">Swimming with Ceph</em>, the new off-Broadway smash hit: <em class="calibre7">New York Nukem</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The word comes down somewhere between East River Drive and Fifth Avenue. I can’t really put my finger on when, because I’m too busy getting shot at. But by the time I finally catch up with what’s left of Strickland’s convoy just outside Central Park, the news is really sinking in.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Strickland is furious. Barclay fought it tooth and nail. Gould says what do you <em class="calibre7">expect</em> when you keep putting psychopathic assholes in charge. (In his own fucked-up Gouldian way, I think he almost feels vindicated. A shame he never got a chance to meet Leavenworth.)</p>
<p class="calibre20">Me? I gotta say, I was kind of on board with it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe I’ve lost my sense of empathy. Maybe after a few years in the service you just get used to it, come to terms with the fact that life is cheap. Maybe SECOND’s programmed it out of me <a class="calibre21"></a>with all these nanoneurons infiltrating my cortex. Or maybe it’s just harder to care about the living when you don’t actually have a dog in that race anymore. But I listen to Strickland ticking off the outrages—What about the people? What about the surrounding boroughs? What about the fallout?—and if I had a voice I might shut her down with a question of my own.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What about the <em class="calibre7">Ceph</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I mean, it’s not as though I’ve agreed with most of what the Pentagon has been up to lately. That sweeper they set off just about inspired me to resign my commission on general principles. But the fact is, it didn’t work. Nothing they’ve tried so far has worked—and when your back’s to the wall, scorched earth is not exactly unprecedented military doctrine. A tactical airburst over Manhattan might be the only way to contain this thing. Probably won’t be enough, granted; but if all else fails it’s worth a shot.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Of course, all else <em class="calibre7">hasn’t</em> failed. There’s still the Alcatraz Initiative. But the brass aren’t boots; they’ve got reports from the front lines but they haven’t seen this apocalypse for themselves. Chances are, all they know about the Tunguska Iteration is that it was invented by a half-crazed recluse pickled in formaldehyde, and Nathan Gould says it has something to do with homosexual rape in hanging flies. If that was all <em class="calibre7">I</em> knew, I wouldn’t have much faith in it, either.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We haul into Central Park under a yellow sky infested with sheet lightning. Nobody’s waiting for us. No reinforcements. No Ceph. No pilgrims.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Nobody.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We park in a field of scrub and crab grass. Dead silence except for the far-off rumble of thunder. “Where the hell is everybody?” someone wonders.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Maybe they threw everything they had at us back on 58th,” Chino suggests. “Maybe they got nothing left.” He doesn’t even believe it himself.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>No birdsong. Not even the crickets are talking.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Strickland looks around grimly. “Something’s wrong here.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The birds haven’t left, though. We know this in the very next second, when they do. Great clouds of them rise suddenly from the trees in waves, dark as spore, utterly silent. They flap away to the east as the first tremors start to shake the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The tree line<em class="calibre7">—buckles</em>. Treetops lash back and forth against a windless sky. They <em class="calibre7">rise</em> into the twilight as if on hydraulics; I can see brief explosions of blue sparks in the darkness around their bases. Power lines, I realize. Tearing apart as the ground rises <em class="calibre7">there</em> but not <em class="calibre7">here</em>, as cliffs grow from the woods as we watch, walls of raw fissured bedrock standing up from the earth, lifting the forest on its back. One of the Bulldogs hops two meters in the air, flips, lands upside down. The nearer copses are leaning toward us now, farther, farther, toppling over. Ridges of rock and earth rise and pile up and slide back down the sides of something very large and very old, waking up after a million years in the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Those of us with vehicles floor them in reverse. Those on foot run like hell. Barclay’s in every headset, “Strickland? Strickland? What the hell just happened out there? We’re reading massive seismic disturbances, we’re reading—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can’t see the top anymore and the Thing in the Earth still rises smoothly from the ground. It must be halfway to the jet stream by now. A dozen little waterfalls cascade out into space and disintegrate into mist far over our heads.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Sir, we are going to need an immediate airlift,” Tara Strickland calls in with admirable calm. “As well as armed air support. As many aircraft as you can manage. The situation has … changed …”</p>
<p class="calibre27">It’s the mother, the father, the whole damn extended family of all Ceph Spires. It’s the last page of the Book of Revelation, the end <a class="calibre21"></a>of the Mayan Calendar, the drowning of the world at Ragnarok, and it’s taken half of Central Park along for the ride. There’s a mountain towering over the skyline. I bet you can see it all the way to Canada.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The spire holds it up, all that mass stuck to one impossible pylon: a chunk of earth the size of a hundred city blocks, hanging over Manhattan like Everest balanced on a pool cue. The spire itself towers even higher, a dark twisted sculpture skewering the floating island about two-thirds of the way along its length. From down here, through the deepening gloom, it looks a little like the Statue of Liberty with brimstone highlights. If the Statue of Liberty was a couple of kilometers high and had a terminal spore infection.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Whatever chance Barclay may have had to talk the nuclear option off the table with his superiors, it’s pretty much vanished now. They do give us a few choppers, though, and all the moral support we can carry.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They also give us thirty minutes before they send in the bombers.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It gets darker as we approach. Water drains from ponds and reservoirs, atomizes as it falls, turns the sky into soupy fog: dark in places, flickering bright where fires have caught, flashing where dismembered fragments of the power grid spit and spark. I can hear the groan and crack of breaking granite over the beating of the rotors. Gas lines and sewer pipes stick into the air like severed veins, gushing flame or wastewater.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I was wrong. This is no island in the sky; this is a tumor. If God had cancer it would look like this: black and lumpy as a miner’s lung. On closer approach I can see it’s not even a single mass: one foggy silhouette resolves into many, a jumble of boulders: some no bigger than houses, others that could crush city blocks. The cracks and fissures between are infested with black <a class="calibre21"></a>spinal conduits of Ceph architecture, embedded, a web of ligaments holding everything together.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Well, not <em class="calibre7">everything</em>. Chunks of granite calve away like icebergs as the pilot looks for a place to land. We’re coming in low from the south, ten meters over the treetops: tiny blue maintenance trailers and miniature statues sit down there like tabletop ornaments, lit at odd angles by a random handful of streetlamps still running off stored solar.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The chopper’s bucking like a cork in a wind tunnel. The closer we get to the spire the worse the turbulence becomes; if we keep on this approach the downdraft’s going to slap us into the rocks before we get another hundred meters. Landing here is out of the question. Even farther back we can’t risk it; the whole thing’s a pile of shifting rubble, loosely bound with alien rebar. The pilot’s willing to push it to eight meters, right at the southern tip; I drop the rest of the way and he backs right off to a safe distance, whatever the hell <em class="calibre7">that</em> means these days. The rotors beat away into the soupy darkness and suddenly it’s—</p>
<p class="calibre20">—Peaceful.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m on the grass. There’s a constant wind but the sound it makes is almost comforting. Just five meters behind me the world drops away, and I can see the dim gray shapes of downtown New York spread out like chips on a motherboard.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And in the next second the world drops away just <em class="calibre7">two</em> meters behind me, and I’m scrambling back from that edge before this crumbling rock pile pitches me overboard.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Oh, man, look at the calving on this thing!” Gould’s back in the chopper with Strickland, but he’s riding shotgun through the suit feed. “Alcatraz, listen, all this bedrock’s just hanging off the structure. It’s completely unstable, could go at any time. You gotta watch for stress fracturing.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">You know, Nate, I think I figured that one out.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>To the north, the superspire stabs up into the night like a church steeple for Devil-worshippers. Twenty-six minutes to Plan B. The N2 drives me over the ground faster than the ground can open up to swallow me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then the chopper pilot blurts out, “Oh shit, they’re <em class="calibre7">everywhere</em> …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Alcatraz, listen.” Strickland again. “Barclay’s expeditionary guys got into the park yesterday before they were driven back. And CELL had an evac base here as well. Look for ammo caches, you’re going to—well, you’ll need firepower.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">And they’re on me before she hits the period.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I barely hear her breaking the pilot’s balls to get in closer, give me some cover. I barely hear False Prophet announce that he’s completed a local scan and nailed some likely ammo dumps. I hear the Ceph, though, stuttering like bullfrogs, lacerating the air with their tracers. I take a couple of hits before cranking armor; a couple more after I leap across a shifting chasm (gray chaos, nothing at all down there) and roll to cover. It’s too far for the grunts but a lone stalker sails easily over my hiding place and clamps its talons around the trunk of a tree ten meters past. Then the tree’s falling, torn free of the earth by a couple of hundred kilograms of metal and jelly using it for a grab-on at thirty meters a second. And the outcropping it jumps to next, crumbling under its feet. And the pickup truck it tips over the edge of a severed roadway. The stalker leaps from point to point, never missing, never regaining the edge; it disappears into the void, dancing between falling objects.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Far to the north something lashes the sky: The spire has grown <em class="calibre7">limbs</em>, segmented tentacles that flail back and forth like whips. A pair of spines extend from each segment. Or legs, maybe. I’ve seen them before: monstrous metal centipedes writhing in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I see other things, too, smaller but just as monstrous, moving south to welcome me across the shifting landscape. We skirt <a class="calibre21"></a>each other, exchange fire, duck back into hiding. The ground tilts and slides as we dance. Something sets two massive slabs of substrate jostling like continents in collision; downhill and uphill trade places; some pond or wading pool breaks free of containment and floods across the battlefield in a thin sheet, turning earth to mud and making the grass slippery as oil. Sometimes the Ceph nearly take me out. Sometimes I take fire from an unexpected quarter, SECOND backtracks a bearing, but I can’t see any targets.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Still, if the point of the exercise is to kill each other, I’m better at it than they are. So far.</p>
<p class="calibre20">In between the skirmishes, though, there are—moments. I almost feel guilty talking about them. Fighting for the survival of a planet, halfway through a thirty-minute nuclear countdown with all objectives yet unmet: How dare I waste a <em class="calibre7">second</em> on goddamn <em class="calibre7">aesthetics</em>? But there they are, surrealistic and beautiful: a dense blue carpet of tiny, perfect flowers, running down the middle of a pedestrian avenue. An ancient bronze statue standing atop a granite pedestal: long since turned green, its head and shoulders white with pigeon shit. A lone taxicab skewed across the grass, softly spotlit by a single streetlamp in the fog.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I find one of Barclay’s caches in the passage under Bethesda Terrace: scuffed plastic crates piled up in a dim grotto full of arches and golden alcoves and polished ceramic tiles that pattern the ceiling like a Persian carpet. There’s more than enough canned carnage here to see me through to whatever end awaits me in—yup, twenty minutes and counting. I scrounge one of those new X43 microwave guns. I saw a couple of the guys using them earlier today; not much good on armor but they cook jelly right in the package so long as you remember to squeeze off short shots. Hold the trigger for more than an instant and you’ll drain the battery in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Resupply, reload, resume. I cloak at the north end of the underpass, <a class="calibre21"></a>stick my head out. The spire towers into a dead gray sky; the cracked fountain in front of me looks like a bug in its shadow. I think the tarnished thing in its center is supposed to be an angel but it looks more like a zombie with wings.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The centipedes have stopped flailing. They’ve bitten into the ground and taken root, given up the wild days of their youth and settled down to become great hairy arches looping across the sky. As if the spire has grown legs.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Ah, shit. I know what that means.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Sure enough, here’s Nathan: “Dude, it’s set up substations. Like back at the hive. Whatever you did back then, you gotta do it again.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The suit serves up new targets and tacticals. At least the Ceph are consistent: either form follows function or the aliens have no fucking imagination whatsoever. Same substation layout, same relative distances, same basic vulnerabilities.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Harder uphill battles.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Heavies guard each substation, slow but almost indestructible. Their missiles are easy enough to dodge a few hundred meters out, but the closer you get the less time there is to get out of the way—and these fuckers are smart enough to play defense. I have to come to them and they know it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Besides, there are plenty of grunts and stalkers to take the game forward. More than I think, at first. I stealth past choke points and high ground (higher ground) where the enemy should be waiting, find no one there—then get my ass shot at from behind, five seconds later. I hear little rockfalls to my left, the soft chittering of a stalker on my six, turn to track and come up empty—and ordnance lights up my flank where there was nothing but rocks and air a moment before. The rising wind blows the mist off most of the exposed reaches but everywhere there are pits and depressions where the air is stagnant and the fog pools like milk. Naked <a class="calibre21"></a>eyesight is useless in there; StarlAmp and thermal see through the fog but still can’t catch the Ceph. They pin me down between the edge of the world and a crumbling cement footbridge, turn the sky into a shooting gallery whenever I so much as peek around the corner.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The ground crumbles to air under my feet and now I’ve got no choice; it’s either an express trip back to earth or a Hail Mary run straight across the kill zone. I lay down suppressing fire as I run, spray an arc as empty as the eye can see—and a grunt materializes from thin air and collapses in a twitching heap in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Holy shit: The Ceph up here have <em class="calibre7">cloaks</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I make it to the safe side of a toppled army barricade, wondering: What took them so long?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fifteen minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">New weapons, new tactics. Two shots with the Mike makes your average grunt pop like a zit windshield—but the substation Heavy on which I try it is still shooting back after I’ve drained it dry. I ditch the Mike, switch to L-TAG: Two smart grenades finish the job. It takes four to down the Heavy at the second substation, but I get lucky at the third: I miss the target completely but I knock out whatever’s holding up the <span><span class="calibre9">US-ARMY</span></span> prefab barricade leaning behind it. Ten meters of hardened cement comes down on the Squid like God’s own tombstone. Forty seconds later the last substation is down for the count.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The wind’s been building with every step I take toward the primary target; now it howls around me like something tortured. But I’m so close, now. The spire isn’t even a spire anymore: it’s massive, it’s city blocks on a side, it’s a goddamn cathedral of the underworld. It’s every part of every bottom-dweller the earth ever spawned: armored shells and jointed legs and segmented antennae; more sharp-edged mouthparts than you can count; <a class="calibre21"></a>blood-red gills, pincers and claws all jammed together by some monstrous trash compacter and pressed into a tower that stabs the stratosphere. The cracks between those pieces pulse and dim with orange light, as though someone were blowing on embers.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Bright light ahead, spilling around the rocks of this outcropping. I cringe in the shadows like Adam after the apple, hiding from an angry God. The wind tries to push me into the light. My fingers find cracks in the rock, dig in against the gale; flattened against the granite, I lean forward.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Wheels within wheels: a spoked, segmented disk, at the base of the structure, big enough to plug the Holland Tunnel. It seems to lead into the structure’s interior, a great circular portal awash in blinding white radiance. Air intake. Or if you prefer more romantic imagery: a tunnel of light.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s about fucking time. I’ve been dead for two days already.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I remember lessons learned at Hargreave’s knee: the spore’s basically an antibody. It’ll swarm to the site of an injury. Nathan Gould, bringer of Bad News, pipes up: “Dude, you gotta get <em class="calibre7">inside.</em>” I can barely hear him over the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Tara Strickland, bringer of Much Worse News: “God<em class="calibre7">damn it</em>. The STRATCOM order just went thr—Alcatraz, you’re out of time! <em class="calibre7">Go!</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Shit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I step out from behind my rock. I don’t even have to jump. The Tunnel of Light sucks me up like a bird into a jet engine.</p>
<p class="calibre27"><em class="calibre7">Blizzard</em> doesn’t come close. <em class="calibre7">Hurricane</em> misses the mark. <em class="calibre7">Wind tunnel</em> might catch the nuts and bolts, but it can’t convey the gut feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know if anything can.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The spire breathes you in and for the merest instant it almost seems calm: The walls are a blur but there’s no resistance as long <a class="calibre21"></a>as you just go with the flow. Then you reach out for a handhold, grab on to the first thing that hits your fingers, and the wind slams down on you like a mountain at Mach Two.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’d have never even made the catch without the suit; my fingers would have ripped right off my hand. If I had made the catch, I’d never have held on; I would have left my arm hanging against the wall while the rest of me slammed down into—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Where am I now? Far beneath the tumor in the sky, at least. I must have shot out the bottom of that rock pile a split second after the spire sucked me in. Surely I’m back on earth, back <em class="calibre7">under</em> it, down in the deep dark levels where extinctions are made. The spore blasts down, around, past me like a storm of needles, like ball bearings from a railgun. BUD strafes my visual cortex with yellow-coded updates on <em class="calibre7">epidermal integrity</em> and <em class="calibre7">maximum armor</em> settings but it’s all just talk; the suit’s abrading around me like a heat shield on reentry.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can’t even see where I am. There are flickers of orange light, flickers of blue, everything high-contrast and stroboscopic; I’m blind to anything more than a few centimeters past my faceplate. I realize that whatever I’m hanging off, I’m hanging one-handed: my other hand, miraculously, is still clutching the L-TAG. I cradle that launcher to my chest like a baby, I hold on to it for dear life.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I try to bring it up but the wind resistance is too great; the most I can do is aim down and off-center, toward the wall of the shaft. Could be conduits along this thing, right? Could be power lines and vital circuitry. I fire blind, empty all my grenades into the maelstrom; the wind yanks the empty weapon away. I think I might hear a distant muffled <em class="calibre7">boom</em> over the howling of the wind. Maybe not.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s no doubt about the sudden vibration that shakes the walls, though. It shakes me loose and slams me down another endless tunnel.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Which actually ends.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Maybe the suit keeps the impact from turning me to jelly. Maybe it just keeps the jelly contained in a human-shaped sack. But I’m on the deck now, and the wind screams sideways instead of down, and I can just barely roll into the lee of some protruding piece of machinery half embedded in the wall. It’s still not even close to calm air: the back-eddy scouring this little wind-shadow is a gale by any standards—but it’s nothing the suit can’t handle, assuming it hasn’t already been damaged beyond repair.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The nuke could go off, and in here I’d never even notice.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Thoughts occur to me. I don’t know if they’re mine or SECOND’s, or even if that’s a difference that makes a difference anymore. Something thinks: <em class="calibre7">Bad vent design: Too much turbulence</em>. Something thinks: <em class="calibre7">Maybe this isn’t a primary vent. Maybe the primaries are offline, or damaged. Maybe the Ceph just aren’t into laminar flow</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something thinks: <em class="calibre7">There’s so much spore swirling around this goddamn suit I can barely see my own feet so why isn’t it interacting?</em> and I’m pretty sure that’s me. Because the answer’s so bleeding obvious:</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">It’s an antibody. It swarms to the site of an injury</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So far I’m just an inert particle in this body. It’s time to turn malignant.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m all out of fancy firearms but the N2 comes equipped with a pretty good Kung-Fu Grip. And way down here in the basement of the doomsday machine, there just <em class="calibre7">has</em> to be something important to tear at. Doesn’t have to be vital. You don’t have to attack the heart or the brain to get the white blood cells to take notice. Any old chunk of tissue will do.</p>
<p class="calibre20">This outcropping I’m hunkered down against right here, for instance …</p>
<p class="calibre20">I raise my fist, bring it down. Nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Again: a dent. Maybe. Maybe just spots in front of my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>I find something that looks like a seam, hook my fingers underneath, pull. It gives a little. I pull again, putting my back into it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The panel peels back like the zip-top lid on a can of cat food. Blue light sparkles within.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I go to town.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Blue light recedes. Orange is in ascension. Every time I bring down my fist, copper lightning forks and crackles from the breach. It takes thirty seconds for me to bring this whole segment of passageway alive with electricity.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It takes less time than that for the antibodies to pay attention.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They boil out from the main flow as though someone’s punched holes in an invisible pipe: black angry thunderclouds in search of a parade to rain on. The wind doesn’t seem to bother them; they cut across that howling flow as if the air were dead still. They’re more than smoke, more than particles; they’re a <em class="calibre7">collective</em>, a billion microscopic agents acting in unison. I can see them talk among themselves: I look into that seething darkness and I see a million faint sparks winking back and forth as the nanites trade notes and make plans. Structural damage in sublevel whatsit. Power failure in thingamajig twenty-three.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Invader.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Infection.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">There</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They swallow me whole, billow around me like some monster amoeba. The suit catches fire. That’s what it looks like, anyway: that orbital time-lapse of burning rain forests where half of SouthAm is sheathed in orange sparkles. Only the smoke isn’t <em class="calibre7">rising</em> from the tiny fires burning across my body; the smoke is falling <em class="calibre7">into</em> them, it’s precipitating, it’s <em class="calibre7">condensing</em> down into the light. It’s Brazil, run backward. The suit drinks in the spore; the <a class="calibre21"></a>embers fade along my arms and legs. Nothing else happens for a moment or two.</p>
<p class="calibre20">My fingertips start to tingle. My fingertips start to <em class="calibre7">glow</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I begin to brighten from the outside in.</p>
<p class="calibre20">All those black specks, resurrected. All that ash turned back into flame. The particles rise like a blizzard of stars: from my arms, from my chest, from my legs and feet. So much mass, escaping; it seems impossible that any might be left behind. Perhaps my very molecules are flying apart, perhaps my whole body’s ablating into luminous mist.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Suddenly I’m as incandescent as a goddamn angel.</p>
<p class="calibre27">The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The spire vented, of course. That was the whole plan. It went off exactly when it was supposed to, but not before we’d raped its hanging fly ass; and when all that jizz spread out across Manhattan, it was carrying <em class="calibre7">our</em> sperm, not the Ceph’s. The Tunguska Iteration blew those fuckers apart like maggots in a microwave.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They say it was even closer than we thought. All those other spires popping up across the city, those were just beta releases. Tweaks, test runs, short-lived and self-terminating. That Central Park fucker, though: That was the mass-production model. It would’ve been shooting <em class="calibre7">replicators</em>. And then you’re not just talking about Manhattan, or New York, or even the whole tristate area. You’re kissing the whole damn planet good-bye. That’s what they say, anyhow. Of course, they don’t really <em class="calibre7">know</em> anything.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Actually, Roger, I don’t think they even know that much. I don’t think we <em class="calibre7">have</em> won. In fact, this is just the beginning. I’m pretty sure your bosses know that, too.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Because Gould had access to Hargreave’s feed. Gould knows what I saw, Gould knows stuff I haven’t told you here today. And if Gould knows, your bosses do, too.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Personally, I think of it as kind of a group home, a mansion with many rooms. And one of the residents wakes up in the middle of the night—hears a noise upstairs, maybe—and goes to investigate. He doesn’t bother waking the others. It’s probably just squirrels, or the cat knocked over a lamp or something. No point disturbing anyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But it’s not squirrels, and it’s not a cat—or if it is, it’s a cat that’s figured out how to use the shotgun on the mantel, and now a gunshot’s gone off in the attic. Maybe there was a scream when the bullet hit, maybe someone shouted out a warning. And all the other gardening tools in all the other rooms, they’re waking up now. They want to know what happened. They want to know where their friend is. Maybe they’re even putting in a call to their owners to come have a look-see.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hargreave would probably have some really valuable insights right about now, don’t you think?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Well, yes. As far as we know. But come on, Roger; you can’t have forgotten that Hargreave was never in it alone. It’s right there in the name of his company, for chrissake.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So tell me. What do you know about a dude called Karl Rasch?</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_38"></div>
