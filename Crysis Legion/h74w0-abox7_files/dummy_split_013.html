<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre29">Start with a honeycombed coltan/titanium exoskeleton, for 32% greater strength than the N1 at half the weight. Wrap it in CryNet’s patented artificial muscle: an armored carbon-nanofiber composite storing elastic energies of up to 20 J/cm<sup class="calibre41"><span class="calibre4">3</span></sup>, with electromechanical coupling that exceeds 70% under most battlefield conditions. Sheathe it all in a flexible doped-ceramic epidermis and a Faraday weave that shields against EMPs while still supporting telemetric throughput of up to 15 TB/sec. Put it all together and you have a combat chassis that laughs at almost anything short of a direct hit with a battlefield nuke. (In fact, in three out of five simulations, the Nanosuit 2.0 even withstood the point-blank detonation of a Lockheed AAF 212 Circuit-Breaker™!<a id="filepos173477" href="#filepos242318" class="calibre10">*</a>)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">And what fuels this unmatched combination of power and protection? Virtually anything. While the N2’s primary coupling is compatible with any BVN-series hydrogen cell, the suit also acquires and stores energy automatically from a wide range of ambient sources: kinetic motion, passive solar/thermal, and atmospheric microwave to name but a few. The standard-issue universal adapter allows recharging from virtually any hardline electrical source, domestic or military—and with CryNet’s optional Necro-Organic Metabolites plug-in (NOM), the N2 can even extract usable energy from battlefield carrion!</p></blockquote>

<p class="calibre16">Was I just on too many hit lists? Were CELL and Ceph both gunning for me and it was just my great luck that both happened to <a class="calibre21"></a>track me down at the same time? Or were they dusting it up with each other, street-to-street, and I just got caught in the crossfire? I don’t suppose you’d care to enlighten me?</p>
<p class="calibre20">’Course not. You’re here to <em class="calibre7">ask</em> the questions.</p>
<p class="calibre20">That first wave of Ceph, though, I could swear they’re running from <em class="calibre7">something</em>. They scramble down the walls and the street in a wave—mean-ass stalkers, baseline bogeymen. I open fire out of pure reflex, take a few down, and they’re shooting back with those big fucking gunhands of theirs, but they seem to have other things on their minds. And now here comes CELL screaming around the corner in their Humvees, and all I’m hearing is <em class="calibre7">It’s that suit guy, suit guy’s right here!</em> and <em class="calibre7">Blue Command, engaging target!</em> and then I’m hitting the fucking <em class="calibre7">ground</em>, man, because suddenly the air is a shitstorm of bullets and RPGs. I don’t think they even notice the Ceph at first.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They see ’em soon enough, though. One of the Humvees goes up and suddenly the Ceph are getting <em class="calibre7">lots</em> of attention.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m on the ground, under cover, pinned down but not in anybody’s direct line of fire unless they’ve got a micronuke to take out the collapsed wall I’m hiding under. I cloak up and peek around a pile of cinder blocks; I’ll get shredded above the knees if I try standing, but at least both sides seem to be too busy shooting at each other to wonder where I’ve gone. I keep low to the ground, crawl for an H&amp;M with its doors conveniently pre-blown off.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The suit continues to relay inspirational messages over comm: “Blue eighteen, this is Lockhart. Please confirm kill.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Lockhart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Blue Eighteen. I said <em class="calibre7">report.</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I make it to Lingerie. There’s an employees-only entrance beside the crotchless panties. Elvis leaves the building.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Can you confirm your kill?”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>He’s all over the channel, my nemesis, the voice of my destruction—but right now he sounds more like a distraught mother who’s lost her child in the playground.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I’d say that’s a no, Lockhart,” and that snide dry delivery is such a close echo of what I was just thinking that I wonder for just a moment if False Prophet isn’t reading my mind. But no: It’s a woman’s voice, coming over the comm. A rotor keeps time behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Strickland, get off the comms. Blue Eighteen, do you—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“They’re <em class="calibre7">down</em>, Lockhart. I warned you not to do this by squads. Prophet’s suited up, probably not even sane anymore. Anything less than a platoon, he’s going to go through them like a grizzly through Boy Scouts.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m liking this <em class="calibre7">Strickland</em> chick’s attitude. I like the imagery, too.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Lockhart doesn’t. “You’re easily impressed, Strickland. Why don’t you go back to running around after Hargreave and let me do my job.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I <em class="calibre7">am</em> running around after Hargreave. He sent me down here to oversee retrieval of the suit. And I gotta say, so far it looks like your boys are falling down on the job.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“We’ll get this sonofabitch. And we’ll do it without your help.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Hargreave doesn’t see it that way anymore.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Then the hell with Hargreave, too. He’s got no idea what we’re dealing with here.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">BUD feeds me a bearing: Strickland’s chopper is at ten and eleven.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I’m not going to argue this with you on air, Lockhart. I’ll see you down there. Strickland out.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Ten and ten. She’s going down. And now that I’m a solid city block from the latest Ceph-CELL dustup, I can hear that descending <em class="calibre7">whupwhupwhup</em> bouncing off the walls to my left. My <a class="calibre21"></a>nemesis and his nemesis are headed for a meet-up just a couple of blocks away. If I hustle I might just be able to learn something useful.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What? Oh. Yeah, it is kind of amazing how well I can remember all these details, isn’t it? But you know what really sticks in my memory? Just last week I remember not having anywhere <em class="calibre7">near</em> this good a memory.</p>
<p class="calibre27">I find a ringside seat behind a second-story window in a bombed-out brownstone. Lockhart’s Humvee is parked down the alley behind a Shoppers Drug Mart, like he’s run in for a pack of Trojans but is too embarrassed to go in the front door. Strickland’s chopper idles front-and-center in an empty lot behind a $uper$ave, sharing space with a carpet of weeds and a couple of porta-potties. The way its rotor slashes the air makes me think of a pissed-off cat, kind of lazy and lethal at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They face off in the no-man’s-land between, bracketed by a couple of CELLulites on perimeter watch. Lockhart’s maybe 190 centimeters, your standard flat-topped, bullet-headed, walking military cliché except for the fact that so many of us actually <em class="calibre7">are</em> flat-topped bullet-heads.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Strickland is a walking wet dream: mocha skin, half a head shorter than the man she’s going up against, dark hair pulled back into a ponytail. But it’s pretty clear from the body language that Lockhart’s not in the mood to appreciate any of Strickland’s finer aesthetic qualities. I crank my audio on a bitchfest already in progress.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“—is to take him alive,” Strickland’s saying.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“The order is to bring him down,” Lockhart spits back. “I’ll argue the civil rights details when we’ve done that.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Alive is more useful.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Yeah? To who? The guy just massacred a couple of dozen of <a class="calibre21"></a>my men, <em class="calibre7">Ms</em>. Strickland. I’m taking no more chances. Prophet dies. Hargreave can have his corpse to play with.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Hargreave wants—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Hargreave wants the suit. He’ll get it.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“He isn’t going to like this. And last time I checked, we both worked for him.” I get the sense of a high card being played.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He doesn’t even blink. “That’s where you’re wrong, Ms. Strickland. <em class="calibre7">You</em> work for him. I answer to the CELL Executive Board and the DoD. I don’t give a shit what some senile old shareholder like Hargreave may or may not like.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“That’s <em class="calibre7">majority</em> shareholder. <em class="calibre7">And</em> former president of the CryNet board. You want to be careful what enemies you make here, Lockhart.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He doesn’t answer for a moment. I wonder if maybe Strickland’s finally found a way in; enemies, after all, are something Lockhart must know a lot about. I bet he’s made more than his share over the years. And maybe he doesn’t have to think twice about pissing off Strickland—what could some uppity bitch do to an alpha dog like him, right? But somebody higher up is holding <em class="calibre7">her</em> leash. How many enemies can he afford to make, how many fronts can he wage war on at once?</p>
<p class="calibre20">“This conversation is over,” Lockhart says, and pisses all over Strickland’s territory by climbing into her chopper.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Come on, Strickland. You don’t have to put up with this shit. You can take him. You can. I know this territory, I’ve seen it before, you had to be twice as good to get half as far because of assholes like him. Go in there, throw that fucker out of <em class="calibre7">your</em> helicopter, bitch-slap him all the way back to that candy-ass Humvee of his and show him who’s boss. You’ve got <em class="calibre7">Hargreave</em> backing you up.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I mean, for fuck’s sake. You can stop this asshole, you can stop his whole private army.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You can.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Strickland shakes her head and climbs meekly into the cabin. The chopper lifts off.</p>
<p class="calibre27">That’s a very good question. I’ve asked it myself, more times than you know. I could have blown his head off then and there. Hers, too. Want to know why I didn’t?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I didn’t want to prove him right.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s what he told Strickland, you know? <em class="calibre7">That guy just massacred a couple of dozen of my men</em>. And I just about went off the deep end because <em class="calibre7">I’m not fucking Prophet</em>. I mean, Lockhart’s a complete asshole but I have to admit he’s got a point. I heard the comm chatter. Cobalt and Blue and Azure—Prophet took out half the goddamn rainbow before he and I ever crossed paths. Lockhart’s got every right to be pissed—just <em class="calibre7">not at me</em>. This whole thing’s a huge case of mistaken identity, and if I can somehow make everyone understand that I’m not Prophet, that all I did was inherit the man’s threads, then maybe we could all be on the same side again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But while I’m feeling all outraged and hard-done-by, this voice in my head tries to tally up all the corpses <em class="calibre7">I’ve</em> made since I put on those threads, and it loses count.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The thing is, that’s not really me any more than Prophet is. Not that there aren’t a shitload of folks in this line of work who <em class="calibre7">do</em> fit that profile. You know that. Any job that gives you rank and a gun is going to attract its share of psychos and assholes who get off on throwing their weight around. But that’s not me, that—wasn’t me. I didn’t sign up to kill things, I signed up to <em class="calibre7">fix</em> them. I never—got off on this stuff before.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s the N2. It gets inside you. It changes the way you think, it turns you into—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fuck, listen to me. I sound like some wife-beating drunk, making excuses: <em class="calibre7">It’s not me, honey, it’s the</em> suit <em class="calibre7">talking …</em></p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Do me a favor. If I bring you flowers and promise never to do it again, just shoot me.</p>

<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31"><em class="calibre7">Excerpt begins:</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre34">Sen. Preteela M’Benga: Cmdr. Lockhart, on behalf of this subcommittee I would like to thank you for being here today.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Cmdr. Dominic Lockhart: Happy to be here, ma’am.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Commander, how long have you been an employee of Hargreave-Rasch?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: I’ve been chief of CELL’s Urban Pacification Division for four years. Prior to that I was USMC.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: And what is your current status?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: In addition to my UPD duties I serve as a liaison to the US military when necessary. In those cases I report jointly to CELL and to the Department of Defense.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: And this doesn’t present a conflict of interest?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: With all due respect, Senator, the fact that I am testifying here today proves that it does not.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Aren’t you afraid of repercussions?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: Repercussions, Senator?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: If I’ve been correctly informed about the testimony you’ve prepared, you are about <a class="calibre21"></a>to do what we in the Senate call <em class="calibre7">biting the hand that feeds</em>. Aren’t you concerned that hand might bite back, if you’ll forgive the mangled metaphor?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: No, ma’am.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: May I ask why?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: Without going into details, Senator, let’s just say that knowledge is power. I am in possession of certain knowledge concerning Hargreave-Rasch.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Knowledge beyond that you will be sharing with us today?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: Yes, ma’am.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Moving on, then. The report you’ve presented is quite, er, comprehensive. For those of us who have not yet made it through the entire 864 pages, I wonder if you could distill the essence of your objection down to a concise sentence or two.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: Gladly, Senator. I believe this country needs real soldiers. Not corpses in tin suits.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Excuse me, Commander. “Corpses in tin suits”?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: You wanted concise, ma’am.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: I did. Perhaps we’re not talking about the same project here. My understanding of CryNet’s program is that it involves placing <em class="calibre7">live</em> soldiers into battlefield prostheses, not the reanimation of corpses.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: Senator M’Benga, if you examine the technical specs that follow the executive summary, you’ll see that central to CryNet’s <a class="calibre21"></a>second-generation proposals is a system that can—and I’m quoting here—“assume autonomic, regulatory, and motor functions in the event of somatic damage or operator incapacity.” In other words, the system can run itself just fine when the person inside is dead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Ummm, yes. But I look at those exact same words and I see a suit of armor that can carry its occupant to safety even if that occupant is injured or unconscious. I don’t see—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: With all due respect, Senator, what you are <em class="calibre7">not</em> seeing is that CryNet’s next-generation Nanosuit essentially reduces the soldier to ballast—almost literally to dead meat.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Then why include the soldier at all? Why not simply market this device as a battlefield robot? I’m certain that many on this subcommittee would leap at the prospect of a machine that could take the place of our brave men and women on the battlefield, keep them out of harm’s way.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: I believe that an autonomous battlefield robot is CryNet’s ultimate goal, sir. The model currently under development is merely a foot in the door.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: But why not—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: <em class="calibre7">Again</em>, ma’am, if you read the technical details of this proposal you will see that there are certain—neurocognitive elements that do not yet have a technological solution. Hargreave-Rasch does not say as <a class="calibre21"></a>much publicly, but I believe the only real use they see for our soldiers is as wetware. The system uses the human nervous system to do what it cannot yet do by itself. Jacob Hargreave is asking the American people to fund the development of a machine that would quite literally be a parasite on US soldiers.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Commander Lockhart, assuming that everything you’ve said today is true, would that not be a powerful argument in <em class="calibre7">favor</em> of funding?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: I’m not following, ma’am.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Hargreave-Rasch and its subsidiary, CryNet Systems—these are independent corporations with their own very lucrative revenue streams. If we were to deny funding, they would in all likelihood just go ahead and develop this device privately, under no obligation to share any details with us. If we enter into the partnership currently on the table, however, we become—as representatives of the American people—privy to every stage of development. We gain a say in <em class="calibre7">how</em> it will be developed. Was it not Patton who said “Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer”?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: No, ma’am.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Really? I could have sworn—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: It was Sun Tzu, ma’am. Believe me, CryNet would not have approached the government if they didn’t have to. If they <a class="calibre21"></a>don’t need government funding, they need something else from you and you just don’t know what it is yet. We have—<em class="calibre7">you</em> have the power to stop this abomination in its tracks.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: Commander Lockhart, <em class="calibre7">we</em> approached <em class="calibre7">them</em>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: Excuse me?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: My understanding is that the Pentagon got wind of CryNet’s research and felt that such a project might prove useful in fulfilling their own strategic objectives. They <em class="calibre7">asked</em> CryNet to submit this proposal.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: If the Pentagon approached Jacob Hargreave, then it was because Jacob Hargreave manipulated them into doing so.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sen. Bradley Dubain: Excuse me, but I believe I might be able to cast some light on …?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">M’Benga: I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Dubain.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: Thank you. Commander Lockhart.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: Senator.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: Please understand, I hold you and your service to the country in the highest respect. It is not my intention to question either your integrity or your experience.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: I appreciate that, sir. Did you have a question?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: It is true, is it not, that you have suffered a personal loss as a result of the Nanosuit program?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: (inaudible)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: I’m sorry, I didn’t hear—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35"><a class="calibre21"></a>Lockhart: The Nanosuit program does not yet exist, sir. I am here to try and ensure that it never does.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: The Nanosuit 2 is still under development, yes. I was speaking of the earlier version, the one that was deployed—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: That is neither here nor there, Senator. I am not talking about the past, I am concerned about how we move forward.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: I appreciate that, Commander. That is what we are <em class="calibre7">all</em> concerned about. And I’m sure you’ll agree that moving forward, we must base our decisions on the available facts, not merely feelings and opinions.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: I am trying to keep my testimony limited to the available facts, sir. It was you who introduced the subject of personal—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: But isn’t it true that your nephew lost his—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lockhart: <em class="calibre7">Keep your fucking hands off my family, Senator</em>.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Dubain: Uh—Commander Lock—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">McCain: I’m going to call a brief recess. We are adjourned until fourteen hundred.</p></blockquote>

</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">And we’re <em class="calibre7">off</em>, running on goddamned foot along the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Expressway, doing our best to get to Nathan Gould before Lockhart’s minions get to us.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Early betting favors the CELLulites but the Propheteers have pulled it out of the fire before, ladies and gentlemen, the Propheteers <a class="calibre21"></a>should be dead a dozen times over but they’re still in there kicking. And don’t we all love cheering for the underdog?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not so much, apparently. Not when CryNet Enforcement and Local Logistics cuts your paycheck. One of the players on the opposing team puts it pretty succinctly over a channel he doesn’t think I can access: “That piece of shit took out half of Cobalt Section. That piece of shit is toast.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Which should make me hungry—I haven’t had a bite to eat all day, and even toast sounds like a treat—but for some reason I haven’t felt hungry <em class="calibre7">or</em> tired since the N2 took me in its embrace. I don’t know how long I can keep going on adrenaline, or whatever else it’s pumping me full of, but I have to admit: This nanotech miracle goes a long way toward leveling the field.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A couple of other variables may actually tilt things in my favor. For one thing, private industry pays a lot better than the feds—and while this does let them buy the pick of the graduating litter, it also tends to attract folks whose primary interests are money, benefits, and no fucking overtime. There’s a reason they call these guys <em class="calibre7">mercenaries</em>. You don’t level up nearly as fast doing nine-to-five as you do pulling twenty-four-seven. So even without the N2 I am a harder dude than 90 percent of these fuckwits, and a lot more experienced.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The other thing is, the upper echelons are bickering again, and the boots on the ground are getting confused.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It starts when Drab Seven helpfully broadcasts the location they expect to take me out at. A familiar voice cuts him off: “This is Tara Strickland on oversight. Our objective for this target is capture and interrogate; I’m placing the kill order on indefinite hold.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Drab Section is not too happy about this. Seems they had friends in Cobalt and do not like <em class="calibre7">Special Adviser</em> Strickland reining them in. She keeps trying, though. She tries when a CELL Apache pins me down just south of Fulton, brings the whole damn freeway down on my head. She tries as Lockhart’s troops <a class="calibre21"></a>chase me through the sewers under South Street. She tries when Drab tries to take me down with a tame EMP.</p>
<p class="calibre20">That one might have worked, if they’d been smart enough to boost their amps. The N2’s coated in a bleeding-edge Faraday weave, specs say you can throw a Lockheed Circuit-Breaker at it and it’ll keep on ticking. But nothing’s absolutely pulse-proof; the only way to keep all EM <em class="calibre7">out</em> is to not let any <em class="calibre7">in</em>, and then you’re deaf dumb and blind. So there’s a chink in the armor there. They could have pulled it off if they’d gone all-out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But they might as well have used a Taser for all the good that sparkler of theirs did. Fuzzed my tacticals for maybe half a second, put a bit of a jitter into the haptics. Barely even noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Drab Section noticed, though. I sent half those assholes off to party with their friends from Cobalt.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But it’s still no night in Reno, let me tell you. It’s one nasty evil-smelling pile of shit after another. They’re throwing everything at me from bricks to bombs, and the Ceph are all over the map; they’re tying up CELL, which is good, but they’re not going out of their way to make my life any easier, either. And through all of this Strickland keeps shouting <em class="calibre7">Belay that!</em> And <em class="calibre7">Shoot to disable!</em> And Lockhart’s cutting in with <em class="calibre7">Kill order confirmed</em> and <em class="calibre7">Disregard further orders from Special Adviser Strickland</em> and <em class="calibre7">Someone kill that tin fuck for me</em>. I gotta hope that at least they’ve gone their separate ways by now, because I do not envy their pilot if they’re still riding in the same chopper.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And of course I don’t have enough to worry about already so Nathan Gould pops in on his own channel, gives me the breathless breaking news that Lockhart’s people are swarming over the whole Lower East Side looking for me. No shit, Sherlock. And then they’re coming after <em class="calibre7">him</em>, I hear them kicking in the door when I’m still six blocks out and somehow Gould gets away, makes it down a fire escape or something, so now Gould’s warehouse is enemy territory and he’s on the run to an ex-girlfriend’s <a class="calibre21"></a>place where he’s stashed some surplus hardware that might do in a pinch. He sends me the new address and then he realizes that he also left it back at the warehouse—you know, the lab that’s now swarming with CELLulites—and we are totally fucked the moment one of them sits down at the terminal and checks his address book. One guess who gets to storm the warehouse and make sure <em class="calibre7">that</em> doesn’t happen.</p>
<p class="calibre20">At least this chapter has a happy ending, though, right? How many of those boys did I take out when the chopper crashed? Beautiful, beautiful sight, man. Came right down through the skylights, all that glass sparkling and tinkling like winter snow before the Meltdown. And you know, at least one of them was still alive on impact. I could see her mouth move through the bubble as she came down. I could see her screaming. Thank the good Lord for grenade launchers, eh Roger?</p>
<p class="calibre20">You should probably tell those guys to keep better tabs on them, though. They can be holy hell in the wrong hands.</p>

<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: We—we used to live there, you know, before. Last week. We kind of hunkered down when it all started—that’s what they told us to do, right? Stay calm, stay in your homes, let the authorities do their jobs. So that’s what we did, we holed up in the apartment for three days before Mike—that’s my husband—he decided to head out and try to find some food. We were supposed to go grocery shopping, you know, the day it started. We didn’t really have much on hand.<br class="calibre8"/>    So Mike’s gone for six, seven hours—there’s no cell phone coverage, right, there hasn’t been since everything fell apart, and I start to—is that my … that’s my <em class="calibre7">daughter</em> screaming, that’s—<em class="calibre7">Emma!—</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35"><a class="calibre21"></a>Lansing: No, ma’am, that’s not Emma. I told you, Emma’s sleeping.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre34">Sweet: But … who is it, who’s <em class="calibre7">screaming</em>, who’s—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: It’s not Emma, Caitlin. I promise. Honestly, it’s nothing to concern you. If we can get back to your story …</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: It’s—it’s a bit bright in here …</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: I can turn down the lights if you like.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: So your husband’s been gone for six or seven hours …</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Yes. And the cell phones aren’t working, and there’s this, I don’t know, this muffled <em class="calibre7">whump</em> from outside. Like an explosion, but far away. So I go out onto the balcony, you know, just to look around, just to maybe see what’s happening. And about three blocks down along 15th there’s one of those spires, you know. Just sticking up out of the road, four, five stories high, glowing around the base with this banner of thick smoke streaming out the top. The smoke’s blowing my way and before I know it it’s in my eyes. It’s not like regular smoke, it’s—gritty. So I turn my face away, you know, look away in the other direction and—and I see him, down there in the street.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Prophet.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35"><a class="calibre21"></a>Sweet: Who? Oh, you mean—no. Mike. Facedown. He never even got half a block. He …</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Would you like a moment?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: No, it’s okay. That screaming’s a bit distracting though, you know? Anyway, that’s when I decided to leave. The neighborhood just wasn’t safe, and Mike was—gone, and Emma and I were on our own. But my folks live in Brooklyn, and MacroNet’s been saying there was this evacuation site downtown, so Emma and I just picked up and left.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Just so I understand: A spire’s just detonated three blocks from your apartment. Your husband didn’t make it half a block down the avenue. And you decide to take your child outside.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Yes.<br class="calibre8"/>What?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Nothing. Please go on.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: So I take Emma down the stairwell and we head out the back way because I don’t want her to see her daddy like that. And I’ve got my iBall out but the realtime updates aren’t working so we’re basically going by memory. And the farther uptown we get, the more dead soldiers we see. Or at least, you know, they had uniforms. Like yours. Not regular army or anything. Are you real soldiers? Armed forces? CSIRA?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Yes, ma’am. We’re—for all intents and purposes, we are the armed forces.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35"><a class="calibre21"></a>Sweet: Well I didn’t see any <em class="calibre7">regular</em> army, but there were a <em class="calibre7">lot</em> of bodies that looked like you. They were burned, and blown apart—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Yes, ma’am.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Some of them were in <em class="calibre7">pieces</em>, just <em class="calibre7">scattered around—</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: <em class="calibre7">Yes</em>, ma’am. I get the picture.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: And then we turned a corner and we ran into what was killing them. They were these—machines. These walking machines. Like, you know, that old invaders-from-Mars book they made us read back in high school, Walls or Wells or something. There were soldiers fighting back but they weren’t doing well, I mean, no offense but you guys were getting your asses handed to you—</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Why did you keep going?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: What do you mean?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: You have your eleven-year-old daughter with you, you’re walking through a war zone, and the farther you go the more bodies you see. Why didn’t you turn around, go in another direction?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: We were trying to find the evacuation site.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Uptown.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Yes.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: MacroNet said the evac site was downtown. That’s what you said.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Did I?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: You did.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Well, it—it just seemed like the right way to go, I guess.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: I see.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35"><a class="calibre21"></a>Sweet: Could we take a break? I could use some fresh air, stretch my legs a little.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: It’s not really safe outside. Besides, wouldn’t you rather stay close to Emma?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: She’ll be okay. I don’t think she likes the light as much as I do.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: I’ll see what I can do. Just as soon as we finish here. It won’t be long.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Easy for you to say. You’re not trapped in a glass box.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: That’s just a precaution, ma’am. Honestly. Now: You had encountered one of our detachments in a combat situation, is that right?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Combat situation? Oh, yes. And that was when we ran. Emma was pulling at my hand and I was just standing there, I don’t know, stunned I guess, but my little girl’s screaming and so I snap out of it and we just <em class="calibre7">run</em> back the way we came, as fast as we can. And there are things skittering along in the wreckage after us, not like those war machines, not big, but—fast. We could never really get a good look, we were too busy running but you could hear them gaining, they made these little <em class="calibre7">clattering</em> sounds as they moved, like, like big spider crabs or something. And Emma was pulling me to the side, she’s going <em class="calibre7">Mommy, Mommy in here!</em> because she’s seen this little hidey-hole she thinks we’ll be safe in and I’m not so sure but she breaks away from me and dives into this wrecked <a class="calibre21"></a>storefront, right through the display window—well it was already shattered of course but there was glass everywhere, it’s amazing she didn’t open an artery—and I go in after her and the whole second floor has come down, there’s concrete and those twisted wires everywhere and some of those collapsed slabs, they’ve formed this little cave. And Emma dives right into it. And I dive after her.<br class="calibre8"/>    And I know we’re going to die then, because we’re snug and secure in this little lean-to of collapsed concrete, we’re completely protected except for that open part at the front we came in through, it’s the only way in or out. And there’s something there, something—bloated. And spiky.<br class="calibre8"/>    You know what a tick looks like? Mean little front end with needles and teeth for digging into you, and a kind of bulbous inflatable back end that swells up when it feeds? This was like that. Except it had these wavy metal antennae or tentacles or something, like the hoses off one of those old-style vacuum cleaners you had to run yourself. And it was half as big as <em class="calibre7">Emma</em>! It made this hungry little <em class="calibre7">clicking</em> noise, and its antennae were waving around in our direction and it was climbing over the rubble toward us blocking the only way out and we were dead, I just knew right then that we were both dead.<br class="calibre8"/>    <a class="calibre21"></a>Except something shifted in the building then, something just <em class="calibre7">gave way</em>, and instead of squashing Emma and me it landed on this tick-thing and squashed it instead. This big slab of concrete, and dust everywhere, and these antennae-tentacles sticking out from underneath, whipping back and forth. That’s were I got this cut on my face; those things were <em class="calibre7">sharp</em>, like needles.<br class="calibre8"/>    And Emma’s screaming even louder now, she’s calling out for help and those little lungs of hers are amazing, if there’s anyone within ten blocks I figure they have to hear her. But I don’t know whether to curse or pray, because that big pile of cement did save us from the tick, but now we’re trapped. There are gaps—there’s about four or five places where you can see into the rest of the store, even all the way onto the street—but there’s no way even skinny little Emma can fit through any of them. And the chittering hasn’t stopped. It’s only getting louder. I can see things moving out there, the shadows of monster ticks and other things too, I think.<br class="calibre8"/>    And that’s when he shows up. That <em class="calibre7">Prophet</em> you’re interested in.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Yes. Tell me about him.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: I guess he must have heard Emma. He was just <em class="calibre7">there</em>, all of a sudden. He dropped down into sight from somewhere overhead, and he was—I thought he was some kind of robot at first, you know? You see those <a class="calibre21"></a>things on National Geographic and the Discovery Channel, they’ve got those soft-bodied humanoids over in Japan? Acto, actino-something. Soft muscles, almost like ours. That’s what I thought this was at first. Except he wasn’t built like any of those nursemaid robots you see in the retirement homes, he looked like he was built for—heavy construction, or something. And Emma’s shouting <em class="calibre7">Over here! Over here!</em> and I’m right there with her, bellowing my lungs out, and this <em class="calibre7">Prophet</em> of yours, big as one of those museum statues, he just turns toward us—slow, almost lazy, like he’s got all the time in the world—and without a word he just stares through this visor the color of dried blood. Emma and I both shut right up then and there and he didn’t move for a bit, he just stood there cradling this big gun the size of a fire hydrant, sizing us up like he was deciding whether to rescue us or—I dunno—cook us for dinner.<br class="calibre8"/>    And Emma says in this very scared quiet voice, <em class="calibre7">He’s one of them</em>. And I knew just what she meant, somehow, but you know what? I was okay with that.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Excuse me?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Weird, isn’t it? It’s hard to explain, he just seemed to—not <em class="calibre7">look like</em>, exactly, it was more—almost as if he <em class="calibre7">smelled</em> like one of them, if that makes any sense. And it scared the hell out of poor Emma, but to me it was <a class="calibre21"></a>almost—comforting. I forgot to be afraid for a little while.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Mmmm.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: And he saved us. He started tearing through that concrete as if it were cat litter. And the ticks were all over him, he spent more time blasting those vicious little things than he spent digging us out. A couple of times I thought <em class="calibre7">This is it, they’re going to tear him apart</em> but they never did. And he got us out. He rescued us. I told him what we’d seen, where the bodies were, where the machines were fighting, but he seemed—distracted. Put his hand up to his helmet once, you know, as though he was trying to hear a very faint radio station. I wanted to go with him, I almost asked him to take us to the refugee camp, but Emma just didn’t like him at all, Emma never stopped being afraid of him even after he’d saved our lives. So he went on his way, and we went on ours, and that’s when you picked us up. And there’s really nothing more I can tell you so if you don’t mind I’d really like to get out of here now. I’d really like to follow the light.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Just one more thing. Why did you tell him those things?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: What things?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Where the bodies were. Where the machines were fighting.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: He asked.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: How did he—did he <em class="calibre7">speak</em> to you?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35"><a class="calibre21"></a>Sweet: Of course.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: With his <em class="calibre7">voice</em>?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: How else would he speak to me?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Did he sound—was there anything distinctive about the way he spoke?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: Not really. I mean, his voice was a bit <em class="calibre7">buzzy</em>. But that’s just the suit, right? The microphone.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Lansing: Got what, Caitlin?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre24"><p class="calibre35">Sweet: This. In my eyes. On my hands. I can even feel it in my head, somehow, it’s growing but it’s not—not evil. It’s all good.<br class="calibre8"/>    That’s why you’ve got me in this cube, isn’t it? You don’t want to catch it.</p></blockquote>

<p class="calibre20">Okay, then. Let me tell you about my mother.</p>
<p class="calibre20">She was a cunt.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not always, mind you. Not at first. She was never Parent of the Year material—bit on the judgmental side, that just goes with the whole Bible Belt mind-set—but at least she wasn’t a drunk or a methhead. Never hit me. Never forgot me on the luggage carousel. Perfectly decent woman, you know? No complaints, all while I was growing up.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Then the dementia hit, and holy fucking Christ.</p>
<p class="calibre20">She’d turn into a monster. Not full-time, not in the early stages anyway, but sometimes she’d just—snap. Turn into this rabid snarling animal. ’Course she was getting on by then, and times weren’t great generally. My folks lost most of their savings in the Double Dip, which meant they couldn’t replace those fancy antique plates we had after she threw them at me during one of her <em class="calibre7">episodes</em>. All we had left was that cheap plastic shit that would barely dent if you dropped it from orbit. And I wasn’t around much by then, for obvious reasons, so she started whaling on Dad instead. Poor bastard never fought back—some TwenCen bullshit about <em class="calibre7">not supposed to hit a lady</em>, he wouldn’t last a day in today’s armed forces let me tell you. I came home on furlough one weekend and he’d locked himself in the bathroom and she was stabbing at the door with a goddamn screwdriver. He was one big fucking bruise, all purple and yellow, this gentle old fart who never hurt anyone. I mean, he was seventy-five years old! And that was when I decided, <em class="calibre7">enough</em>. I gave the old cunt a choice between the police station and the psych ward. I never saw her again after I got her institutionalized. Not once.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But what really pissed me off was the way people kept making <em class="calibre7">excuses</em> for her.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Nobody saw a monster. All anybody saw was a victim of the disease. That’s why Dad never hit back, <em class="calibre7">It’s not her fault, it’s the dementia</em>. People would visit her in the home and she’d rant and spit and say all these vile things about Dad and everyone would just sadly shake their heads and say, “It’s the Alzheimer’s speaking, how can you cut her off like that, she’s your <em class="calibre7">mother.</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">But the thing was, they couldn’t have it both ways. If this <em class="calibre7">was</em> the disease, then it wasn’t my mother at all; my mother had died years ago, she died when the dementia undid all the circuits that made her what she was and rewired her into this vicious twisted body-snatcher thing made out of recycled meat. In which case I owed it nothing. And if she <em class="calibre7">was</em> my mother, well, then my mother was a rabid dog that needed to be put down if you ask me, and I didn’t owe <em class="calibre7">that</em> thing any special breaks, either.</p>
<p class="calibre20">No matter how you looked at it, I was off the hook. Switch the wiring, pimp the neurotransmitters, and <em class="calibre7">mother</em> turns into <em class="calibre7">other</em>. There’s nothing fixed about who or what we are, Roger. Even if it looks the same, it’s <em class="calibre7">not</em>. It’s all just wetware to be wiped, rewritten, rebooted. I learned that when I was just a kid, I learned that without any of your fancy degrees or candy-colored MRI readouts.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And that’s why I have to laugh every time you sneak a peek at your reader, there. Because you’re a <em class="calibre7">mechanic</em>, dude. You should know this shit better than I do. You fumble around using words and drugs when you really should be getting in there with a very tiny soldering gun, but when it comes right down to it you’ve spent your whole damn career trying to change the circuitry in people’s heads. So why do you keep looking for answers in my <em class="calibre7">file</em>, Roger? I’m not that person anymore. I’m something new.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And believe me. The thing that’s talking to you now has no mommy issues whatsoever.</p>
