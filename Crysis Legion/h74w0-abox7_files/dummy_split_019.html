<p class="calibre16"><em class="calibre7">“This is Delta Six to base, we … backup</em> now! … <em class="calibre7">civilians in tow, wounded … engaging … some kind of alien armored … sonic …”</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">Rebar. Power lines. I-beams and buildings blocking the signal. Wherever Delta Six is holed up, I can’t hear shit down here.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I get off my ass and start climbing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Delta Six, this is Echo Ten.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Echo’s coming through clear, at least. Bad news for Delta; huge difference in signal strength probably means huge difference in location.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“We are en route to your position, but the streets are blocked. It’s gonna take time to …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I poke my head back above ground level. Delta Six’s signal firms up:</p>
<p class="calibre20">“<em class="calibre7">We don’t have time</em>, Echo Ten!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Delta Six is losing it. Delta Six is screaming. And something else is screaming in the background, too, something that sounds a little like glass cracking on metal …</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You get here <em class="calibre7">now</em> or you’re just gonna be counting our fucking <em class="calibre7">corpses</em>!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">SECOND serves up waypoints and sat fixes and triangulated guesswork. Echo Ten is still out in the boonies. I might just make it, though.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Shit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I check what’s left of my gear, ditch the scarab; the seawater’s fucked the firing mechanism. Everything else seems good to go. GPS puts me about three or four klicks from the action, depending on the waypoints.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I start running. The farther uptown the higher the ground: I wade the occasional stretch but when my feet hit solid ground they burn city blocks like firewood. The topography’s been radicalized up here: Buildings lean into one another, flat streets shaken into corduroy, whole blocks just kind of <em class="calibre7">pushed back</em> and piled up against the terrain behind. Madison Square Park is a steaming swamp—the tops of cabs and SUVs rise above the water like sunroofed boulders. One of the Staten Island ferries is jammed up at a crazy-ass angle against the buildings on the northern perimeter; I never realized before how huge those things are. You gotta wonder how many buildings <em class="calibre7">that</em> bad boy took out on its way uptown.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I keep moving as north as the terrain will let me. Delta Six fades in and out at the whim of whatever obstacles happen to be fucking with the freq at any given moment. Bad news from Central; something’s going on there and it’s not going well, but I can’t tell any more than that. Some kind of running battle seems to be moving east, and the news from that quarter is no cause for joy, either. But I still take heart because hey, at least the battle’s still <em class="calibre7">on</em>, right? They haven’t been squashed like bugs yet; at least some of them are still kicking after being in the thick of it for half an hour or more, and I’m thinking that’s no small accomplishment. I know what these guys are up against.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Thought I did, anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something’s making the ground shake, just a little. I see it more than feel it: ripples in puddles, like a stone’s been dropped when no stone has. My reflection shivering in some miracle windowpane <a class="calibre21"></a>that hasn’t shattered yet. Aftershocks, I think. I’m moving too fast to feel anything through my boots, so I stop for a few moments to get a sense of the seismo. Nothing. The ground’s rock-solid under my feet—which is, now that I think of it, even weirder.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">Bompf</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Now that I <em class="calibre7">did</em> feel, just barely: a single pulse through the asphalt. A short sharp shock; not like any seismic rebound <em class="calibre7">I’ve</em> ever felt, and I pulled the Ring of Fire tour for a solid year. This felt more like an impact tremor.</p>
<p class="calibre20">An impact of steel against glass.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Delta Six isn’t talking. Or at least I’m not hearing them. I hope it’s just another radio shadow, but I pick up the pace anyway. GPS leads me up Fifth, around a corner, and smack-fucking-dab into a dead end.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Can’t really blame the system for not knowing a building had collapsed across the alley. The realtime updates haven’t refreshed since the wave—it takes a lot to swamp the GoogleSat servers but I’m guessing a sudden massive rewrite of the whole lower mainland’s geography might do it—and even plain old GPS gets iffy with all these leaning towers blocking out the sky. Nav’s been falling back on OLR and inertia for hours now, to take up the slack. But there it is: a pile of rubble that used to be an office tower, right between me and where I have to be.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The building it’s fallen against is still standing, though. There’s a loading dock off to one side that I don’t even have to force my way into; any one of a thousand shocks has blown the door off its rollers and halfway into the street. I’m up on the dock with a single bound.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A glassy <em class="calibre7">ping</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Even louder, this time. And not an impact tremor, not the usual kind. If I was underwater I’d compare it to high-freq sonar, <a class="calibre21"></a>you know, like those tests that drove all the whales crazy a few years back. I’m not underwater, and air isn’t <em class="calibre7">nearly</em> dense enough to conduct a p-wave that intense anyway, but still: Whatever’s making that noise sounds like a submarine on steroids.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Or maybe like some kind of one-eyed monstrosity striding across the bottom of a flood zone.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m in the loading bay. I’m in the shipping manager’s office; just like the one I worked in back during my school days except the Golden Showers centerfold is full-motion 3-D now (the whole damn building’s dark but that golden girl keeps glowing and spreading her legs every time you walk past, and she’ll probably be doing it for the Ceph a year from now if those flatcells are as good as everyone says). I’m in some kind of dark hallway, a tunnel; maybe I hear the scuttling of little tick feet but nothing jumps out at me. Three lefts, two rights, one wrong turn into the ladies’ room and there’s an emergency exit sign shining in my eyes like a beacon of blood-red hope. I should be three blocks from the action, four at the outside. I kick out the door.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And wouldn’t you know it, the action has come to me.</p>
<p class="calibre27">You know that poem. <em class="calibre7">Give me your tired, your poor. Your homeless, your wretched refuse. Give me your junkies, your yuppies, your headbangers, your white-collar tapeworms, your priests and your pedophiles</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Yeah, I may be taking a few liberties. But there they all are, a whole fucking avalanche of humanity, pouring around the corner from the Avenue of the Americas. A lot of them are bleeding—from the ears, the nose, some of them are even bleeding from the <em class="calibre7">eyes</em>. Almost all of them are screaming. And you know what my first reaction is?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Relief.</p>
<p class="calibre20">None of them are infected, you see. They’re scared out of <a class="calibre21"></a>their fucking minds, every last one of them is injured in one way or another—but behind the blood and the noise they all look <em class="calibre7">human</em>. No lumpy potato sacks full of tumors, no eye sockets jam-packed with squirming hamburger, no crazy-ass religious ecstasy or hallelujahs for the corruption of the flesh. The spore hasn’t got this far yet. These are just regular run-of-the-mill victims of war, scared to death and probably dead inside the hour, but next to what I’ve seen today this is <em class="calibre7">nothing</em>. I can deal with this. I’m <em class="calibre7">glad</em> to deal with this. This panicked endless mob washes around me, running, staggering, falling, and it’s all so familiar it’s almost like being <em class="calibre7">home</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then that <em class="calibre7">sound</em> hits again, that Crystal-Godzilla sonar, and even inside the suit I go deaf in the aftermath. People are still screaming, I can still see their mouths making the right shapes, but all I can hear is this weird low-pressure <em class="calibre7">trough</em> in the soundscape, this kind of dull roar sucking up every other sound in the wake of that single earsplitting <em class="calibre7">PING</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A little girl’s eyes explode right in front of me. She can’t be more than eight. She doesn’t even stop running; she’s past me and gone in a gory New York second and I don’t even turn around because what kind of sick fuck would go out of his way to watch a blind girl get trampled to death?</p>
<p class="calibre20">This wicked little part of me that never seemed to exist before today, this curious little psycho that doesn’t feel and can’t stop thinking, wonders why just this one little girl and no one else. Figures it must be the size of the head, the diameter of the eyeball in relation to the wavelength or something. Harmonic resonance. But it also figures that pulse is gonna be taking out more than little girls at close range. I’m betting anybody within fifty meters is lying in the street with their skulls blown apart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A Bulldog comes screeching around the corner on two wheels, the grunt on the roof gun hanging on for dear life and firing back at something farther up the avenue. He can’t keep it <a class="calibre21"></a>up; the vehicle crashes back down on all fours and he goes flying. The driver does his best to keep from collateraling the crowd but the Bulldog still manages to sideswipe half a dozen civilians on its way into the jewelry store across the street.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something stalks into view around the corner. It stands eight meters tall if it’s an inch.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’ve seen it before. But this is the first time I’ve <em class="calibre7">seen</em> it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Three legs, double-jointed things with clawed metal feet; just one of those <em class="calibre7">talons</em> is almost as big as a man. The carapace is a cross between a cockroach and a B-2; a wedge, a great fucking arrowhead with cannons sticking out the front end like fangs.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Doesn’t use those big guns, though. Not at first. It <em class="calibre7">crouches</em> and this, this <em class="calibre7">column</em> rises out of its back: a red glowing cylinder, vertically segmented, like a space heater the size of a gazebo. It rises slowly, almost lazily. Think of someone pulling back on a crossbow before releasing the string.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">PING</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Every window with so much as a splinter in the frame explodes. Cars and storefronts shriek for blocks in every direction. A blizzard of glass rains down on the street, dust and daggers and great jagged sheets; it skewers the living and the dead, takes off hands and limbs neat as a laser. It seems like hours before all that slicing and dicing tapers off; the towers of Sixth Avenue still have a <em class="calibre7">lot</em> of windows. By the time it’s over the living have fled; the dead are dismembered; and I’m the only one left in between.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The monster twists on those giant tripod legs and bends down to look at me.</p>
<p class="calibre27">It’s a smart motherfucker. It sees through my best tricks. I wrap myself in my cloak of invisibility and somehow it knows just where to fire. I hide behind pillars and billboards and it lobs some kind <a class="calibre21"></a>of plasma grenade into its blind spots, coolly flushes its quarry instead of stomping down streets and alleyways in hot pursuit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It turns into a game of tag. I can take maybe a hit or two from that acoustic death ray without bursting like a grape—we share common ancestry, this pinger and I, and maybe we’re a little bit immune to each other’s venom—but I’m pretty sure that three blasts would lay me out and a fourth would kill me, assuming this monster didn’t just decide to squash me flat with one of those big clawed feet instead. And nothing I’ve got up my sleeve seems to do more than scratch the paint on its hood ornament. So I lob a sticky mine and fade back around the corner before I even see if I scored. I drop a proximity mine and dive through a manhole while three floors of office crumble to dust on the other side of the street. I start to see patterns: The pinger has a habit of strafing the air with high-frequency click bursts, especially when it can’t see me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s <em class="calibre7">echolocating</em>. No wonder the damn cloak doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not cat-and-mouse: it’s saber-toothed-tiger-and-mouse, it’s T.-fucking-rex-and-mouse. And that dinosaur may have me outgunned a hundred times over, and it may be able to beat my ass on the straightaway, but it’s a big fucking ship and those things turn <em class="calibre7">slowly</em>. It’s got cannons that even CELL would trade half its annual profit margin for, but it can only fire them <em class="calibre7">forward</em>. I can’t outrun the monster but I can outmaneuver it, dip and weave and jump from ground to rooftop and back again. It would have slaughtered me a dozen times if I hadn’t gotten out of the way a split second before it let loose.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And all the time I’m bobbing and dodging and running between its legs, I’m scratching the paint on the hood ornament. After a while the hood ornament falls off.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I start scratching other parts.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Now some of the other mice start poking their heads up, make the most of the diversion. The pinger charges down the street with its sights fixed firmly on my retreating ass, and a line <a class="calibre21"></a>of flechettes hemstitches across its flank from the carpet store across the street. Some brazen glorious asshole with nothing to save his balls but standard-issue camo and a pair of mirrorshades jumps down from the second floor and gives this felching tripod the <em class="calibre7">finger</em>, I shit you not, and takes off around the corner. The pinger takes the bait and chases that beautiful bastard onto the biggest spread of proximity mines you ever saw outside an Israeli payback party.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You know what happens when all those scratches finally strip paint down to the primer? You start scratching the <em class="calibre7">metal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s a running battle, man, it’s a long fucking battle, all of us mice against one big metal dinosaur, and it may be death by a thousand cuts but it’s the JAW that finally brings it down. A single rocket, right under the carapace where the legs plug in. It <em class="calibre7">blooms</em>, Roger, like a flower opening in the morning, it blooms into this great ball of crimson electricity like someone red-shifted the northern lights. The pinger <em class="calibre7">groans</em>, it staggers; it starts to fall, puts out one leg to brace itself and the leg just snaps clean off. That big metal mother goes down like a mountain sliding into the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Delta Six love me to death. I’m the guy who scored the winning touchdown. They slap my back. They like my moves. They say they could really use me back at Central. They call me <em class="calibre7">suit guy</em>, and we shoot some well-deserved shit at those fucking Pentagon brass: <em class="calibre7">Hey, lucky for us the flood wiped the Ceph off the board, yeah, things could be</em> really <em class="calibre7">nasty if</em> those <em class="calibre7">mofos were still around</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then we hear something.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know quite how to describe it. A kind of breathy sound, a <em class="calibre7">hooting</em> sound, drifting over the rooftops and down through skyscraper canyons. It seems to come from everywhere and nowhere, an icy, undead whisper. I tell myself that all the hairs on my forearms have not just stood up.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Everyone falls silent as hunted rabbits.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Dear God,” someone whispers when the sound has stopped. “What <em class="calibre7">is</em> that?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The CO steps in before that shit can spread: “Stop standing there with your dicks in your hands, people! Sweep for survivors! Fifteen minutes, tops! Then we go find out what’s making that noise, and kick its ass!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s gotta be a joke, of course. But the delivery’s so deadpan you’d never know it.</p>

</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16"><a class="calibre21"></a>Of course, getting there is half the fun.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I listen to my new friends as we head out, pick up a few insights. The local chain of command is down to a few rusty links by now. Army, airborne, USMC—hell, even the NYPD and the fire department have gone seriously entropic from the top down. What’s left is a mash-up of half a dozen uniforms and half a dozen jurisdictions, deserters and rogues and decent shits who would still do the right thing if only they could get a straight answer from an authorized CO. But over the past few days these lost souls have found their center, their father figure, their beacon of command in the Shitstorm of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I hear him on the ether as we slog past 29th and Broadway: “This is Colonel Barclay to all marine fire teams at the primary <a class="calibre21"></a>and secondary perimeters! I want a controlled fallback to the terminus by stages, regrouping as you go! Our objective is full evac of civilians and wounded, and we will hold this station until it’s done! You have at most one hour to make your way back here; after that you’re going to be walking home.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He doesn’t sound like the Second Coming. He sounds like he thinks the world’s going to lie down on the job the moment he drops his voice below fifty decibels. But Chino’s vouched for the man, and every surviving jarhead and gravel-pounder seems to back him up: Sherman Barclay is the only reason the Ceph are still facing any organized resistance at all. Without him, we’d all be Lord of the Flies by now.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Central Station is well above the flood zone; everything north of 26th stayed high and dry. <em class="calibre7">Too</em> dry, actually: Carbon and clouds water down what’s left of the late-afternoon sun, and coming up Sixth we can see the storefronts glowing from five blocks away. A couple of the guys start coughing as we cross 36th—</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Smell that? What the fuck <em class="calibre7">is</em> that?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">—and I crank open my hepafilter to get a whiff for myself. Not the usual taste of a city on fire; I’ve smelled that a hundred times since I joined up, it sits in the back of your throat and stings your eyes like an old friend. The smell of <em class="calibre7">this</em> great burning is different, somehow. More—acrid. It’s not completely unfamiliar, though. I’ve smelled it once before, down in Texas during the Secession Riots. Mob was torching a publisher’s warehouse full of science texts.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh, yes. I know that smell.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“This is Charlie Seven. The western approach is compromised. We are pinned down at the library on Fifth and West 42nd. We’ve got dozens of civilians here. Requesting fire support to get ’em through to the station.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">The smell of burning books.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We cross East 40th and into the ragged remains of a green <a class="calibre21"></a>space. GPS serves up <span><span class="calibre9">BRYANT PARK:</span></span> in better days a broad perimeter of trees around a central lawn. Kindling, now, and a trampled kill zone with no cover at all. The New York Library looms on the other side, a great stone edifice slotted with narrow windows fifteen meters high; a whole other set of windows, glassed arches eight meters tall, sits on top of those. I can see the faces jammed in behind them.</p>
<p class="calibre20">In the background, Barclay’s deploying reinforcements to our location.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Closer to home, the Ceph are doing the same.</p>
<p class="calibre27">It’s a mess. The library’s full of soldiers and civilians but we can’t even get across the goddamn street without some dropship raining Squids and hellfire onto our heads. We take cover in a converted apartment complex across the street and even in there I get my ass shot at, by fellow <em class="calibre7">backbones</em> no less: the requisite asshole from Retard Six thinks I look like <em class="calibre7">one of them</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know how many got out of the library before the dropship bombs the shit out of it. I don’t know if <em class="calibre7">any</em> did; we’re coming in from the back, don’t have any kind of bead on the main entrance. But suddenly the whole place just goes up. The windows blow out, the ceiling crashes in, fire everywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I didn’t even know stone <em class="calibre7">could</em> burn like that.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It doesn’t kill everyone inside, not immediately. You can hear faint screaming over the flames. We’re supposed to have cover by now—Charlie Company’s got a missile battery across the park but the guy manning it is either dead or taking a bathroom break, and whenever anyone tries to cut across the park they get mowed down from on high. We finally make it, get the turret back online, even take down that motherfucking dropship, but by then the voices have long since lost out to the flames.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We push on anyway, partly because Hey, there’s always a <a class="calibre21"></a>chance, but also because we’re taking heavy ground fire from behind and we’re literally being driven forward. We fight rearguard across the park, and a few marines—that guy from Retard Six, for one—even make it to the back steps with me. But the place is a fucking inferno; they’d be toast two steps past the threshold. I leave them to find their own way around.</p>
<p class="calibre20">First time I’ve ever been in a library in my life. I gotta say, Roger, I really don’t see the appeal.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There are places even I can’t go: stone glowing red, smoke so thick there just isn’t any point. I try thermal but it’s even worse, like being caught in a false-color blizzard. Lots of bodies, black no matter <em class="calibre7">what</em> wavelength you use to look at them. Steam rises from some of those mouths, from corpses still wet enough to boil inside. They sizzle on the floor like bacon. Some are charcoal already. They break and crumble and burst into pieces when you trip over them.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I hear voices. At first I think I’m hallucinating. But I follow them anyway, to some shattered stairwell where a freak cross-draft blows away enough of the smoke and the heat to keep the people huddled there from dying quite as fast. I turn a small hole in the wall into a bigger one and they stagger outside, coughing, to take their chances with the Ceph.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But it gives me an idea: Forget the people. Key on the <em class="calibre7">habitat</em>. Don’t waste time looking for life signs, look for those few, far-between places where life signs are possible. I toggle back to thermal and yeah, the psychedelic hurricane is still distracting as hell, but now that I know what to look for I can see dark patches here and there in the static, little sunspots of less-than-killing heat.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Roger, I got some of them out. Four marines, a few firefighters, maybe half a dozen civilians. Less than twenty all told, next to Christ knows how many who burned to death. I lost count of the corpses I passed in there, and I only covered a fraction of the floor space.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">But I got them out</em>. I got them out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And for a little while, being dead isn’t so bad.</p>
<p class="calibre27">But only for a little while. Because yes, it’s nice to save lives for a change instead of ending them—but even that doesn’t really fill the emptiness inside.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And no, I’m not being maudlin. I mean that literally.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You think I don’t know? I’ll grant you I was a bit slow on the uptake back at Trinity, but I’ve had a lot of time to think since then. Hell, I’ve grown a lot more of whatever it is I think <em class="calibre7">with</em>, and you know what I remember? I remember those med techs in the basement saying I didn’t have a heart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">That hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’ll tell you what else I remember. Squiddie laying a bull’s-eye on my chest the moment I crawled up onto Battery Park. I remember knowing beyond any shadow of a doubt that I was dying. I remember Prophet dragging me across the battlefield, stashing me in that warehouse, stripping himself out of this suit and bolting me into it. That took <em class="calibre7">time</em>. It wasn’t even dawn when I got hit; when I woke up it was midmorning.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Tell me, Roger, do you think <em class="calibre7">you</em> could hang in that long without a functioning heart? I know I couldn’t. So however shredded up I was back then, the ol’ ticker was still beating. Had to be. And then just a few hours later they scan me outside Trinity and it’s nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe it doesn’t even stop with the heart. Maybe my lungs are gone, too, by now. My liver? My guts? How much of me’s actually <em class="calibre7">left</em>—am I just a shell of bone and muscle around a whole lotta empty space? Put a zipper in front and I’d have one big honking extra allowance for carry-on, hmm?</p>
<p class="calibre20">You know what happened to them, Roger? (Ah, I see you don’t. Something else your masters didn’t tell you.) They got <a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">recycled</em>. Because even this magical suit can’t do everything. It’s a nanotech miracle, it can turn blood into bone and water into wine, but it’s gotta start with something, <em class="calibre7">capiche</em>? Needs raw material. Can’t magic up mass out of nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So the way I figure it, it had a <em class="calibre7">lot</em> of shit to fix and not enough bricks and mortar to go around, so it—triaged. Robbed Peter’s heart to pay Peter’s spinal cord. It can fill in for the plumbing, that’s dead easy. Alcatraz doesn’t need a bunch of pipes and pumps when CryNet Systems Nanosuit 2.0 is taking up the slack. But the central nervous system, now; that’s a whole different pile of pigeons. You take away <em class="calibre7">that</em> stuff and there’s no Alcatraz left to interface with. So this magic suit’s been hollowing me out all this time, <em class="calibre7">mining</em> my expendable biomass to repair the more important systems. Maybe it’s still at it, for all I know. Maybe it won’t stop until there’s nothing left but a brain and a couple of eyeballs and a mess of nerves hanging off the bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Yes, I suppose that <em class="calibre7">would</em> be excessive. But maybe it’s got other reasons, maybe physical repair is just part of what it’s doing. It is a jealous skin, Roger, and it’s already been dumped once. Prophet had to literally rip it from his flesh and blow his own brains out to be free of the fucking thing. Maybe the suit doesn’t want to go through that again. Maybe it’s whittling me down so I won’t be able to—leave …</p>
<p class="calibre20">Just a machine, eh? <em class="calibre7">Just</em> a machine. Tell me, Roger, have you ever seen a <em class="calibre7">machine</em> that can do what this baby does? Do you know how it works? Because I can guarantee you that even Jacob Hargreave has only the vaguest goddamn clue, and he stole the damn thing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Angry?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not really, now that you mention it. I’m alive, after all—or at least, I’m not as dead as I would’ve been otherwise. On balance, it was a good trade. But it’s a stupid question, Roger, a meaningless question. You should know that by now.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Editing anger out of the equation is dead simple for something that can turn hearts into minds.</p>
<p class="calibre27">After all this I get to Central Station. I just don’t get to <em class="calibre7">stay</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s a makeshift convoy outside the front entrance to the library. There are Ceph, too, but there are always Ceph. We’ve learned to deal. We shoot at each other all the way along 42nd, but for once the backbones have the edge; we’re closing on Central, we’ve got mines set up all over the place and defensive perimeters behind them, we <em class="calibre7">own</em> this neighborhood.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Except when we don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Turns out the Ceph have artillery, or something like it. The western approaches are a gauntlet of mortar fire raining all around the station. Once we get inside—after we’ve dodged the shells, and shouted down the usual friendly fire from paranoid trigger fingers, once we convince them we’re all on the same side and get under cover and make it to the decon tunnel—before I can even sit down, a staff sergeant name of Ranier appears at my side and politely asks me to leave the premises again. Turns out Barclay’s laid down some countermeasures to take out the Ceph bombardment. He’s going to drop a building on them, or at least block their line of fire with one. But the plan’s gone off the rails; something tripped the safety breakers, the demolition charges need to be reset manually, and the guy Echo Fifteen sent to do the job is trapped across the street with half his leg blown away. Ranier doesn’t suppose that maybe <em class="calibre7">I’d</em> be willing to …?</p>
<p class="calibre20">He’s not quite that polite, of course. He’s just firm enough to make sure I can’t possibly interpret it as a request.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You know that line they feed you in boot camp, <em class="calibre7">You can relax when you’re dead</em>? Complete bullshit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So now I’m back outside and by now the day is done and the night is young. Ranier’s considerate enough to call ahead and tell <a class="calibre21"></a>Echo Fifteen to expect me; he even asks them not to shoot at me by mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You’re not going to believe this, but the hike down Park Avenue is almost—beautiful. The sky is a luminous orangey brown, big half-moon hanging over the skyline. I’m moving along one of those elevated rail lines where the subways break surface now and then, and I’ve got a great view. Ceph artillery arcs majestically overhead like comets in formation. They light up the whole zone, blue-white, radiant. A couple of them smack into the MetLife Building behind the station, and the electric ripples pulsing out from those hits look like fifty thousand volts of Saint Elmo’s fire.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The only real drawback is, if the Ceph got Ranier’s memo about not shooting at me, they’ve definitely circular-filed it. They’ve got their own turf right next door, their own perimeter, and it is sewn up so tight it squeaks. By the time I get through I’ve got a whole lot more respect for Echo Fifteen; there’s no goddamn way I would’ve made it that far without a cloak.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I find them a dozen dead Squids later, in a shot-up diner a few blocks down Park Avenue. They point me to their point man, Torres, stuck in a hotel three buildings farther down and five floors up. Torres is still clutching the detonator when I get to him, sprawled on the floor with ammo and blasting caps and a couple of Bren guns scattered around like empties. He looks like the lone survivor of a high-octane frat party.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Hey, man, good to see you. Help yourself to some gear.” He’s in pretty good spirits for a guy trapped behind enemy lines with one leg out of commission. Must have been some primo shit in the empty hypo sticking out of his thigh.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We’re hunkered down in a corridor that runs around the edge of the floor, shot-up drywall at our backs, shot-out windows in front of us, and perfect line-of-sight to the target: ONYX Electronics, a twelve-story brownstone with a gaping four-story bite <a class="calibre21"></a>already taken out of it halfway up. It’s kitty-corner to our position, and the intersection between is a ninja’s wet dream: cover everywhere, cars, upended slabs of roadway, even a couple of subway cars teetering on rails hacked off at the edge of an overpass.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Torres takes it in with a wave of his hand: “As you can see, I have got myself a ringside seat. And I am well and truly pissed that the main event canceled after I went to all this trouble to get tickets. I think all the seismic activity must’ve tripped the breakers or something. I’d go back and reset ’em myself, but—” He pulls the hypo out of his leg, grins at me with a row of bleached teeth and one very stylish gold incisor. Little gemstone or optical circuit or something embedded in there. “We set three charges down in the parking garage. Once I get a green on all three, you’ve got a New York minute to get yourself clear, but man, just <em class="calibre7">look</em> at all the cover I made for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He knuckle-bumps me. Must be older than he looks. “You can thank me later. Getting in should be easy.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">It is. So’s getting out again afterward.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Sitting on the fifth floor of a bombed-out Hilton, waiting for the guy in the magic suit to come back? Not so much.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Maybe one of the reasons I got in and out so easy is because every damn Squid in the neighborhood was gunning for Torres.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It makes sense. I mean, who knows how those spineless bastards think, but Torres was the one who planted the charges. Torres was the one with the detonator. Anyone—any<em class="calibre7">thing</em> with a set of eyes on the ground could have figured he was the linchpin. Not to mention the weak link.</p>
<p class="calibre20">All I know is, about two seconds after Torres radios, “That’s it, man! Green across!” Echo Fifteen starts taking fire.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Torres calls back to Barclay: He’s arming the detonators but <a class="calibre21"></a>he’s under attack and needs covering fire. But the rest of Fifteen’s already gone rearguard under the Ceph assault. Barclay calls me up: Tag, you’re it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">’Sokay. I was in the neighborhood anyhow.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m barely out of the ONYX before I know how it’s going to end, how <em class="calibre7">Torres</em> is going to end. Right now he’s scared shitless because he’s still afraid to die, and he’s afraid to die because he still thinks he might live: “Ah fuck, they’re flooding the building! Covering fire, <em class="calibre7">I need covering—</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">But the only cover he’s got is me, and I’m down on ground level with my back to a shot-up taxi while Squiddie shoots at me along three separate vectors. By the time I take two of them out Torres has learned the facts of life, swallowed them whole, and processed them in what, thirty seconds? A minute?</p>
<p class="calibre20">He’s not calling for backup anymore. He’s not talking to us at all. He’s talking to <em class="calibre7">them—</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">“Come on, you motherfuckers! <em class="calibre7">Come on</em>!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">—and <em class="calibre7">fuck it</em>, I don’t care what the odds are and I don’t care if there’s still something out there with a bead on me, I’m up and running, zig and zag and <em class="calibre7">jump</em> while Study’s ammo streaks past and Torres rages in my headset, one-legged Torres, Torres the gimp, and his last furious act of defiance and that <em class="calibre7">rage</em>, man, that absolute blood-boiling rage when you know you’ve done every last thing any soldier could and it’s <em class="calibre7">not enough</em>, the fuckers just keep coming and the most you can do is check out with your teeth buried in something’s throat.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m almost back at the building when I see him coming down to meet me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He hits the pavement—I hear every bone shatter from ten meters away—and he <em class="calibre7">bounces</em>. He flips in midair, flops like a rag doll, comes down again, smears blood and guts across the asphalt as a fire hydrant catches him in the spine. It stops him dead, folds him in half like a broken branch.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Suddenly the freq is jammed with fucktards specializing in the blindingly goddamn obvious, <em class="calibre7">Torres is down</em> and <em class="calibre7">We lost Torres</em> and I <em class="calibre7">know</em> assholes, I saw him die, he’s right here in front of me. Even Barclay gets in on the chorus, <em class="calibre7">We lost Torres, Alcatraz, you need to find that detonator</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But he’s wrong about that. I know exactly where the detonator is. I’m looking right at it. It’s clenched in Torres’s left fist. He hung on to it right down into hell and gone.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He brought it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I pry his fingers open. I pull it free: the size of a staple gun, a pack of smokes. Torres died with his thumb pressed on the stud; ONYX stays standing across the street, even though all three lights are green. I squeeze the trigger the way a man would; nothing happens. Something’s jammed in there.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I squeeze the trigger the way Golem Boy, the way False Prophet would. Something snaps. I hear a <em class="calibre7">click</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Across the square, ONYX <em class="calibre7">rumbles</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It lights up at its base, flickers like sheet lightning. It <em class="calibre7">shivers</em>, from street level all the way up to that blue neon logo on the roof; it slumps in on itself. Sparks explode at its crown: ONYX Electronics shatters into three neon scribbles and goes dark. The whole damn building splits down the middle as it falls; light fixtures and torn wiring light it up from the inside.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And back on this side of the street, something’s following Torres down from the fifth floor.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It shatters the pavement in front of me as it lands: a tank on legs, cannons for arms, compound eyes like clusters of sodium spotlights. A Ceph Heavy, and if these garden slugs are even capable of anything approaching human emotion, this one is <em class="calibre7">pissed</em>. It doesn’t even bother shooting at me with those cannons; it <em class="calibre7">backhands</em> me with them instead, knocks me halfway across the street as ONYX collapses in a heap over its shoulder. I reach for my weapon but there’s a couple of tonnes of angry mechanized <a class="calibre21"></a>jelly in the way. The Ceph raises one of its cannons, aims. I stare down a muzzle big enough to fit my head into.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And one of those teetering subway cars, dislodged by the death throes of the building across the way, lurches down off its embankment and squashes my nemesis like a bug.</p>
<p class="calibre27">The Echoes give me a victory lap with pom-poms and cheerleaders all the way back to Central, cover my ass against the vindictive sniping of a bunch of Squids whose biggest gun has just lost line-of-sight. But when they send me around to the back entrance I get the usual grief from the usual hopped-up goon: the spotlight in the face, the gun barrel, the usual <em class="calibre7">looks like them</em> bullshit. I almost dance with the fucker on general principles—show him firsthand how much ice his yapping-poodle act cuts against a dead man wired into battle tech so far ahead of the curve he couldn’t see it with the fucking Hubble—but his CO calls him off. Nathan Gould, apparently, says I’m one of the good guys.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I let the poodle live. You’re no Sergeant Torres, asshole.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The wounded are stacked up along the halls before I even make it to the loading bay. Some civilian with more heart than brains—and a stage-one infection to boot—tries to get to his wife through a checkpoint marine and gets thrown back on his ass for his trouble. I hear screaming in the distance; a jarhead faces off against two medics in hazmat suits. <em class="calibre7">There’s nothing wrong with me, man, I feel fine. This is bullshit</em>. I pass a man on a cot muttering, <em class="calibre7">Jesus, it’s eating me, I can feel it eating me</em>. He looks fine to me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I keep walking. The medics have it. The medics have it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s that other kind of ambience, too, of course, the kind I’ve gotten too damn familiar with over the past day or so:</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7"> … there a man in there?</em></p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">Sure doesn’t</em> move <em class="calibre7">like a man …</em></p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">What, we’ve got robots fighting for us now?</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">I keep walking.</p>
<p class="calibre20">This is where all roads lead: a decontamination checkpoint manned by more hazmat humanoids, razor wire strung out across the bars and turnstiles that herded commuters back in better days. A couple of CELLulites cool their heels in a holding cage off to the left, arguing with the marine on the other side of the bars. I listen in while a med tech passes some kind of UV wand over the N2: used to be army, one of the mercs is saying. Nine years. Just like you. But the guard isn’t buying it: Whatever you were in the good ol’ days, you’re private now. RHIP <em class="calibre7">revoked</em>, assholes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">You tell ’em, Sergeant.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Interesting that CELL’s been reclassified to arrest-on-sight, though. Maybe Hargreave’s got his groove back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Dr. Hazmat waves me through; the gate swings open behind him. Decon air lock on the other side sprays me with disinfectant and Christ knows what else. The far hatch hisses open a crack; I recognize the voice that wafts through. A little rougher, perhaps. A little more worn-out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I push the hatch open and run smack into Chino—“Hey man, glad you made it!”—but he’s not the man I’m looking for. Colonel Sherman Barclay stands in a basement grotto of cracked marble and cement, surrounded by cots and supply crates and jacked vending machines. His eyes flicker in my direction, but he doesn’t miss a beat; he’s in the middle of instructing one Nathan Gould on the subtleties of civilian status in a city under martial law. From the set of Barclay’s jaw I’d have to say that Gould is proving to be a slow learner.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They both turn to me at the same time. Gould’s all hail-fellow-well-met; I think he’s just glad to have an excuse to get out of remedial class. Barclay’s a little more restrained. “Good to have <a class="calibre21"></a>you aboard, marine. My men speak highly of you.” He pauses, almost smiling. “Shit, most of ’em are downright <em class="calibre7">scared</em> of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Really. I hadn’t noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Colonel Sherman Barclay in one word: <em class="calibre7">tired</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He hides it well enough from the troops. Turns that bone-deep weariness around and serves it up as the eye of the storm, the deep pool of calm in the middle of Armageddon. His men swarm around him like ants on uppers; he fields their questions and feeds them commands and he never breaks character once. Maybe one of the reasons he’s so exhausted is because of all the needy terrified grunts feeding off him.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s a good act, and it keeps his troops together in a cesspool that should by rights have us all shitting our pants and heading for the hills, but you can see the signs if you’ve got the right accessories. You can see the stress lines crinkling the eyes. You can thermal past the three-day growth of stubble and catch that involuntary tic at the corner of his mouth, that nervous little spasm nobody else seems to notice. He’s good, he’s very good, but he doesn’t fool Alky, False Prophet, and the Holy Ghost. We see right through him.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s okay, though. He’s holding it together, one weary-ass cocksucker outmatched and outgunned by monsters from the stars, and he doesn’t bitch about the fates or complain about his bosses, he just buckles down and does the fucking job as best he can. And after the Nathan Goulds and the Jacob Hargreaves and the Commander fucking Lockharts, it is a nice goddamn change.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And God bless him, he doesn’t even break character for Gould, although nobody here would blame him if he just hauled loose and belted the little geek into next Tuesday. No, he listens as we follow him through the huddled knots of refugees, down the endless rows of makeshift cots for the wounded, past <a class="calibre21"></a>the doors of prefab refrigerators and crematoriums waiting for the turnover. He listens as Gould tells him how to do his job: Gotta find Hargreave. Hargreave has the answers. Go to Roosevelt Island, bring him out, by any means necessary. Hargreave Hargreave Hargreave.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay shakes his head, and continues his rounds, and says nothing. Gould raises his hands, exasperated. I brush past him.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He pokes me from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Suddenly I’m facing him; suddenly my fists are clenched. I can feel synthetic muscles cording up my forearms. Gould doesn’t even notice. He’s plugged something into my spinal socket, and he’s only got eyes for the readout: “Fucking military mind-set, man. If I can’t tell him, maybe I can <em class="calibre7">show</em> him.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Yes, Gould, show him. Show him my black box and my deep-layer protocols, show him my secret antidote to the spore.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I scammed this little reader out of the CELL lab when no one was looking. It’s not much, but at least we can access the op logs …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">And why don’t you show him what’s left of my heart while you’re at it. Why don’t you show him the great fucking hole where my left lung used to be.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Wait a minute, that’s not right …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Why don’t you show him that I’m fucking <em class="calibre7">dead</em>, Gould, since you couldn’t be bothered to fill <em class="calibre7">me</em> in on that little detail when you had the chance. Why don’t you—</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Holy shit. Holy <em class="calibre7">fucking shit.</em>”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Finally he looks up, but he still doesn’t see what’s in front of him. He doesn’t see my face through the visor, he doesn’t see how close I am to putting his head through the wall. I don’t know what he sees, exactly.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But whatever it is, it’s bright enough to leave him blind.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Man, what have <em class="calibre7">you</em> been up to today?” he murmurs, and there’s something like awe in his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>He grabs Barclay coming back the other way. “You <em class="calibre7">have</em> to go to Prism.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“No.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I know how to beat the Ceph!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">That gets Barclay’s attention.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I’ve been a complete idiot,” Gould says.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay does not argue the point. “<em class="calibre7">How</em>, exactly, can we beat the Ceph?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Give ’em AIDS!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“That’s not funny, Dr. Gould.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Lupus, then. Rheumatoid arthritis. That’s what this damn suit is—or at least, that’s what it’s turning into: an <em class="calibre7">autoimmune disease</em>!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay doesn’t speak for a moment. Then: “Uh-huh.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Dude, I am <em class="calibre7">serious</em>. I’m looking at the op logs right now, and you wouldn’t <em class="calibre7">believe</em> the places Alcatraz has been hanging out over the past few hours. I don’t have the equipment here to confirm this directly, but the only way this telemetry makes sense is if the whole damn suit is studded with receptor sites! I never even looked for them before, I mean why would I, why would you expect a battlefield prosthesis to—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay cuts in and to the chase: “Dr. Gould. So <em class="calibre7">what</em>?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“The <em class="calibre7">spore</em>, Colonel! Didn’t I say that? This artifact”—he jerks his thumb in my direction, a gesture that takes in the N2 but somehow excludes the meat sitting inside—“can interface with the spore!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">There are wounded, there are dead on all sides. There are orders to be given to those still standing. But Gould has ignited the dimmest spark of hope in Barclay’s eyes. Barclay lets him run with it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“The spore might not be a bioweapon after all,” Gould continues. “At least, not <em class="calibre7">just</em> a bioweapon, not the way we’d understand <a class="calibre21"></a>it. If these readings are right it might almost be a kind of, of portable ecosystem. No, scratch that: more of an <em class="calibre7">external immune system</em>. It basically retcons the local environment to make it Ceph-friendly. That means taking out potentially dangerous macrofauna, of course—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Us, you mean,” Barclay murmurs.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“—but I think it also filters out any microbes that might be incompatible with Ceph biology.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay grunts softly. <em class="calibre7">“War of the Worlds.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould blinks. “Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Nineteenth-century novel,” Barclay says. “Martians invade Earth, kick our asses, but then they all die of the common cold. No immunity. The Ceph have been around a lot longer than we thought; who knows, maybe the bastards read it.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Uh, right.” Gould hesitates; lifers who read ancient science fiction don’t fit comfortably into his worldview. But he’s back up and running in the next second: “Anyway, the spore’s part of a synthetic metasystem, and the N2’s derived from technology designed to interface with that metasystem, so we can, we can—” He snaps his fingers, suddenly inspired: “It’s like gay rape in hanging flies!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">That shuts down conversation for about ten meters in all directions. Even the wounded stop moaning.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Excuse me,” Barclay says after a moment, “I must have misheard. I thought you said—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">But Gould’s on a roll: “There are these insects, hanging flies. And sometimes a male will rape another male; just punch a hole right through the abdomen and ejaculate inside, you know? It’s called traumatic insemination.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know what parts of me the Ceph have blown away and I don’t know how much else has been broken down to keep the rest of me going, but I know that at least my balls are still intact. <a class="calibre21"></a>I know this because I can feel them crawling back up into my abdomen.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“But the <em class="calibre7">really</em> cool thing is, this is actually a viable reproductive strategy! Because the invading sperm doesn’t just float around once it’s in there, it <em class="calibre7">seeks out the gonads of the victim</em>! It infiltrates the testes so that when that victimized fly goes out and inseminates a female, he’s actually <em class="calibre7">injecting someone else’s sperm</em> into his mate! It’s reproduction by proxy. You use someone else’s delivery platform to spread <em class="calibre7">your</em> genetic code!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay purses his lips. “Get the spires working for us instead of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Why not? When you come right down to it, we’re all made out of meat.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay looks at me, and looks away.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“But look, Colonel,” Gould says, “the thing is, the system’s nowhere near field-ready. According to the diagnostic logs, Pro—<em class="calibre7">Alcatraz</em> here tried to interface with some Cephtech earlier today and all the protocols locked up. The suit’s trying to resequence on its own the best it can, but it needs help. It needs Hargreave, <em class="calibre7">we</em> need Hargreave. He’s been three steps ahead of us the whole way. <em class="calibre7">This</em>”—Gould waves his stolen scanner—“this is basically a rectal thermometer. Prism’s a state-of-the-art <em class="calibre7">hospital</em>. It’s got hardware you won’t find anywhere else on the planet, stuff built specifically for the N2. We need to take Prism, by force if necessary, and if Jack won’t cooperate—well, that’s what you have interrogators for.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s a thread thrown to a drowning man. It’s an oasis shimmering in the distance. Barclay is not the kind of man to let wishful thinking trump the facts on the ground, but we are all in such desperate need of good news.</p>
<p class="calibre20">For a moment or two I almost think he’s going to go for it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But then he looks around at the huddled civilians under his <a class="calibre21"></a>protection, at the ragtag soldiers under his command, at the duct tape and chewing gum he’s using to keep it all together, and I know exactly what lesson from Strategy 101 is going through his head: <em class="calibre7">Never</em> fight a war on two fronts. The oasis is a mirage.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay shakes his head.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould won’t let it go. “Colonel, listen—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I <em class="calibre7">have</em> been listening, Doctor. I can’t spare the resources for an assault against a fortified paramilitary installation, not under these circumstances.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“But you have to—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay wheels on him, and the light in his eyes now is anything <em class="calibre7">but</em> hopeful. “What I <em class="calibre7">have to do</em>, Dr. Gould, is hold this location against a superior force that is perhaps ten minutes away from bringing the place down around our ears. What I have to do is keep a thousand civilians alive—including <em class="calibre7">you</em>, I might add—long enough to get them to safety. What I do <em class="calibre7">not</em> have to do is leave these people unprotected on the chance that your scientific theorizing isn’t just a clever dive down the wrong alley.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">His voice is dead level and cold as fucking Pluto. It doesn’t rise a decibel. Gould steps back as though he’s been slapped in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay turns to me. “I need you on defense. Put that suit to some <em class="calibre7">practical</em> use for a change. And you”—turning back to Gould—“are shipping out with the rest of the civilians.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould’s still got some spine left: “You need me here, Colonel—I’m the only one who knows what you’re up ag—”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay waves Chino over from down the row. “Escort Dr. Gould downstairs. See that he gets away safely.” He walks away, tapping his tacpad.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould grabs my arm as Chino grabs his: “He’s wrong, man. Hargreave’s our only hope. You’ve gotta take it upstairs.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Chino’s not a huge guy, but you don’t fuck with him. He wants Gould to move; Gould moves. But he manages one final <a class="calibre21"></a>appeal on the way out: “Go over his head if you have to! Tell them about the hanging flies! That’ll convince them!”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">“Soldier.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">I turn at the sound. Barclay stares unwaveringly at me across three rows of collateral damage.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You’re with me,” he says.</p>

<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Well, of course I didn’t have the gear to pick up that kind of micro-structure, even when I was working at Prism. I was more of a systems man, right? Leave the nanohisto stuff to the grad students. But even if I had the equipment, I’d never have looked for it. I mean, why would you expect the skin of a battlefield prosthesis to come loaded with receptor proteins? Why the fuck would anybody build something like that?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">You know, I don’t think Hargreave himself knew what they were at first. That’s got to be a problem whenever you reverse-engineer foreign tech. You don’t really know <em class="calibre7">how</em> it works, you don’t know what all the parts do. You can copy it, piece for piece, but you don’t really understand it. It’s like, Hey, all these parts fit together to make the best artificial muscle we’ve ever seen! What do these nanohex thingies do? No idea, but when you leave ’em out the damn thing doesn’t work, so we better leave ’em in. And because you don’t know about Charybdis’s shall-we-say <em class="calibre7">unconventional</em> approach to microterra-forming, you’ve got no reason to expect that every piece of tech they ever built is going to have a spore interface right down at the molecular <a class="calibre21"></a>level. You just blindly cut and paste—and sure, you get a kick-ass piece of field armor, but you also get every square millimeter of the thing chock-full of receptor sites and who <em class="calibre7">knows</em> what signals they’ll send when the wrong enzyme cozies up to their substrate?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">It’s not just the basic nanochem we’re talking about here, either. It’s the higher-level stuff, too, the neural meshes. Hargreave laid his own OS over the system, of course, he programmed that suit to his own specs. But you can be damn sure he didn’t program it to fry his own machines when they got too intimate with the deep-layer protocols. The N2, it doesn’t <em class="calibre7">like</em> people poking around down there. Like taking an angry cat to the vet. It hisses, it claws. Shorts out every server in the chain. Weirdest thing I ever saw. Something else Hargreave didn’t count on: The thing’s got its own agenda.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">I pity the poor bastards who end up inside it. I’ve known two of them now. Decent dudes both, you know, Prophet and I go way back and he’s—he <em class="calibre7">was—</em>100 percent stand-up. Alcatraz, now, I only just met him. We hung out for maybe two or three days, off and on, seemed like a decent guy. Kind of cryptic. Once or twice I caught him looking at me—I <em class="calibre7">assume</em> he was looking at me, you know, I’ve never even seen his face?—and I got this, this weird bottled-up sense he was going to explode, but—well, you know as well as I do.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">The thing is, Alcatraz, Prophet—two more different jarheads you will never meet. Prophet never shut up, he was always joking around, and Alcatraz—well, let’s just say, not much in the way of social skills. But put ’em in the N2 and even people that different start to—converge. EEG, voxprints, ACG gates, they all start looking the same after you’ve been in that suit for a while.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre31">Nothing wrong with that, of course. It’s just the system interface, doing what it does. But I’d be lying if I said it didn’t bum me out just <a class="calibre21"></a>a little, you know, for the guys inside. You may think the N2 turns you into God’s own jihadist, what with the induced bloodlust and the enhanced reflexes and the superconducting cognitive enhancements. But you’re just feeling and doing what the damn thing’s told you to. From the outside, sure, you look like an absolute ass-kicking wild man, but really you’ve been—</p></blockquote>
