<p class="calibre16">Ever seen a sweeper in the field, Roger?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Street-Sweeper. No, not the trucks that clear out the gutters. The basic theory’s chimp-simple: Drop a bomb into a body of water offshore from your target, blow it up, let the wave do the dirty work. Cleaner than an airborne nuke, more devastating than a neutron bomb—UniSec even tried to sell it as <em class="calibre7">environmentally friendly</em>, if you can believe it. It’s only water, after all—with a few rads mixed in, sure, but at least there’s no aerial fallout. Pure, clean, <em class="calibre7">natural</em> water.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A twenty-meter wall of it moving at two hundred klicks an hour. Mother Nature’s Doomsday Machine.</p>
<p class="calibre20">That’s what your bosses set on us, Roger. That’s what we had to deal with.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I didn’t believe it at first. Thought there was something wrong with the comm link—I mean, the ol’ N2 can certainly be forgiven for losing a little EM gain after all we’ve been through together, right? So when I get comm back and the first thing I hear is Hargreave shouting about tidal waves I thought I must’ve misheard, you know, a fucking <em class="calibre7">tidal wave</em>? Are you <em class="calibre7">joking</em>, Jack? But the dude’s never been more serious about anything in his life. Because Manhattan has not been dealt enough shit yet, no Roger, it has not. And so there is a cleansing tsunami coming to <em class="calibre7">flood out the aliens</em>. Anything with a backbone that doesn’t have <a class="calibre21"></a>access to a pair of industrial-strength water wings has just been written off as collateral.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What do we know about the Ceph, Roger? I don’t mean whatever secret genetic insights the black labs have under wraps; what does every sad-sack sonofabitch on the street know about the Ceph? Well, we know that they need those exoskels to ride around in, which suggests they’re not great in earth-type gravity situations. We know that when you peel them out of those skels they really look a lot more like boneless sea creatures than like anything that ever walked on land. We call them Ceph because, you know, <em class="calibre7">they remind us an awful lot of cephalopods</em>. All of which strongly suggests a native lifestyle that’s at the very least amphibious, if not aquatic. So what secret weapon does the Pentagon use to take them out?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Seawater.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Let me repeat that, Roger, for the benefit of your chickenshit bosses behind the mirror. The Pentagon. Decided. That the best way. To take out. Super-advanced. <em class="calibre7">Aquatic</em>. Aliens.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Was to <em class="calibre7">drown</em> them.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh, and did I tell you I’ve got this phobia about water? I swear, sometimes I feel like cheering for the other side.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So I hear the jet streak by overhead and I don’t even waste time looking up; I’ve got maybe twenty seconds before it’s far enough offshore to deploy, maybe ten minutes—if I’m lucky—for the wave to drive back through the bottleneck and put us all in hot water. Hargreave’s yelling about getting to higher ground, but what’s higher ground in downtown Manhattan?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I run like hell up Broadway.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Of <em class="calibre7">course</em> it was a bad choice. There weren’t any good ones. What would you have done, hide in a dumpster? Run up fifty floors of some office tower that’s already been so torqued it might go over if you kick it in the shins? Fuck that noise. The farther you get from the waterfront, the higher the ground; the more <a class="calibre21"></a>buildings you’ve got between you and that big fucking flyswatter heading for the coast. Office tower doesn’t do you much good if it comes down around you, but even in a million pieces all that mass is gonna act like <em class="calibre7">some</em> kind of breakwater.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So I’m burning up the boulevard as fast as the N2’s mighty little nanofibrils can move me, and neither CELL nor Ceph nor civilian get in my way. Maybe they didn’t happen to be hanging around on that street, maybe they were and I didn’t notice, maybe the word’s gone out and <em class="calibre7">everyone’s</em> just running for cover; but all I see is cars and corpses, and all I hear is a low steady rumble rising behind me. I know I can’t outrun it—not even <span><span class="calibre9">NANOSUIT 2.0</span></span> can win a race against a tsunami—but maybe it’ll be worn out by the time it catches me, maybe it won’t be a flyswatter so much as a plain old flood. Maybe it’ll just lift me up and carry me along and it’ll be just like river rafting, just a day at the water park.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Right.</p>
<p class="calibre20">That rumbling’s pretty loud by now, and <em class="calibre7">deep</em>, almost subsonic; you hear it with your bones more than your ears. The ground won’t stop shaking. I can feel it under my boots, I can see windowpanes bursting over the street, I can hear car alarms going off. And there are these other sounds too, little metallic <em class="calibre7">popping</em> noises, and I don’t turn around to see what they are because I don’t <em class="calibre7">dare</em>, I can hear the whole Atlantic roaring at my back and no <em class="calibre7">way</em> am I going to break my stride for even a second. But I don’t have to look behind because a manhole cover blasts out of the street right in front of me, and farther ahead, and all the way down the street like a row of space shuttles blasting off on columns of white water. I run through an intersection and something’s blocked off the street to my left and it’s <em class="calibre7">moving</em> and holy Mother of Muhammad the goddamn ocean <em class="calibre7">flanked</em> me, it’s coming at me from all sides now, these huge motherfucking gray-green <em class="calibre7">mountains</em> of water and I barely have time to look up <a class="calibre21"></a>and take one last look at the sky—just this tiny strip of brightness <em class="calibre7">way</em> off overhead, disappearing between two dark heaving walls. It’s like being swallowed whole, it’s like taking one last look at the world through closing jaws.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And I’m squashed like a bug at the bottom of the Mariana Trench.</p>

</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">I wake up to a soft distant roar, like the sound of a seashell held to your ear. I hear a river chuckling away somewhere nearby, a seagull squawking <em class="calibre7">Don’t fuck with me</em>, and False Prophet mumbling something about resequencing vectors. I hear other voices, too: <em class="calibre7">Must be around here somewhere</em>, and <em class="calibre7">Yeah, if Gould’s tracking</em>
<a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">gizmo actually works worth shit</em>, and <em class="calibre7">If the wave didn’t get him. Fucking Pentagon …</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">That last sentiment of which, I gotta say, I’m finding myself more and more in sympathy with. But these guys sound friendly for a change—even familiar—so it is with something close to a sense of hope that I open my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And what should greet me but a blue sunlit sky full of puffy white clouds. And a giant green fist the size of a bus, ready to punch my lights back out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I think Jolly Green Giant. I think Incredible Hulk. Statue of Liberty comes a distant third, but that’s what it turns out to be when my eyes finally focus. Big green disembodied fist in a river that used to be a street, still bravely holding aloft the Torch of Freedom or whatever the fuck it’s supposed to symbolize. Too bad statues don’t come with a sense of irony.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh, and here comes the gunfire. Naturally.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Regular army, this time. Camo fatigues, no insectile body armor, just a bunch of jarheads and Squids shooting at each other. The Ceph seem awfully undrowned, but maybe they have been rocked back on their heels a bit because our boys don’t seem to be having too much trouble mopping them up.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s a nice sight to wake up to, even though I can’t join in the festivities because my suit is still rebooting along with my brain (I swear, Roger, the way this thing crashes I’d swear the OS was written by Microsoft). By the time I can do anything more productive than twitching and rolling around there’s nothing left but backbones. And the best sight I’ve seen all fucking day is the guy who reaches down to help me to my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Alcatraz. Nice suit, man. Fifth Avenue? You been shopping without me?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Chino, back from the dead. I thought he went down with the Swordfish, I thought he was rotting on the bottom of the Hudson. I’d hug the dude if I could do it without crushing him to jelly.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“You <em class="calibre7">do</em> remember me, right? Gould said they’d knocked your voice box out, but he didn’t say anything about brain damage.” He leans in, squints through the faceplate, doesn’t see anything but his own reflection. “What the hell happened to you?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He’s fallen in with some kinda ad-hoc mash-up of marines and airborne and regular army, the closest thing left to a chain of command in this shitstorm. The man who’s holding it all together is one Colonel Barclay—“I served under him once, good man,” Chino says. “Anyone can pull a winning hand out of this pile of shit, he can.” The colonel’s set up a field command at Central Station, way above the high-water line, and he’s keeping the Ceph hordes at bay while the evacuation kicks into gear.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Barclay. I know that name. I heard it a hundred meters under the surface of the Atlantic, back in those innocent days of childhood when we thought gengineered Ebola or a dirty nuke was the worst that could happen, when we thought we were Lords of fucking Creation, when we thought we were such incomparable badasses that we had to make enemies of one another because no one else was up to the job. I heard it a hundred years ago, back when I still thought there was some kind of <em class="calibre7">line</em> between life and death.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I heard it this morning.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There is a chain of command. There are still backbones out here who know which side they’re on. There is a CO to report to, there is a higher purpose. His name is Barclay, and these are his men, and they have come to take me home.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And since Jacob Hargreave’s grand viral counterattack seems to be on hold, I have nowhere else to be. I saddle up and join the posse. I lost pretty much everything I was packing when the wave hit, but Chino’s new friends came prepared. I rearm and reload and help hold back the tide as we head for higher ground.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But oh, Roger, what thy masters have wrought.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There are no streets left, only rivers. Half the storefronts are <a class="calibre21"></a>still underwater. Streets have split down the middle; foundations, turned to quicksand, have given way and dropped whole neighborhoods into the earth. Ceph conduits lie exposed in the fissures, emerging from <em class="calibre7">these</em> masses of bedrock, disappearing into <em class="calibre7">those:</em> They’re everywhere under the city, like sewers beneath the sewers. We walk along the edges of newborn cliffs and see streetlights and shredded leafless treetops, more like roots than branches, barely breaking the surface. The buildings across the park are walls of pigeonholes, all torn open on this side. Anything more than five or six stories up seems dry. Everything else is draining; trickles from the upper reaches, cascades from lower floors that only just got back above the waterline. It’s actually kind of scenic: a great majestic matrix of waterfalls, tinkling and roaring and filling the air with glittering mist. The wave did absolutely nothing to stop the Ceph but it seems to have scoured the battlefield, left all the wreckage squeaky-clean. I see rainbows everywhere I look. Rainbows, Roger. Even nature’s part of the spin machine.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Maybe it took care of the bedbugs, at least,” Chino says.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We fight north while the city drains around us. We evict Squiddie from a flooded Coffee Stop and make it safe for Free Enterprise again. We help out some marines getting their asses kicked by a Ceph gunship in Madison Square. Sometimes we go together, sometimes separately, but we always leave Ceph blood in our wake, pooling like mercury in the wetlands.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Good times, Roger, good times. Once or twice I even remember that I’m dead and it almost doesn’t matter; I’m doing more good now than I ever did when I had a heart. Not even Hargreave can spoil the party. He comes back online once or twice to complain about the dents and scratches I’m putting on his suit, but it turns out even a rich tourist like him has his own problems. He tells me events are <em class="calibre7">escalating beyond his control</em>. Welcome to the human race, Jack. But apparently he and the suit are already busy cooking up Hargreave’s new-and-improved Countermeasures <a class="calibre21"></a>Interface Soufflé, and that’s not gonna change whether I’m fighting Squids or surfing porn. Hargreave spells it out himself: What we need now is <em class="calibre7">time</em>, and if Barclay’s Badasses can buy us a bit of it, maybe I can help them get a better rate of return.</p>
<p class="calibre20">For once, everyone seems to be on the same page. Not sure how I feel about that. I guess you could call me <em class="calibre7">ambivalent</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Now, there’s one of those words I never used when I was alive.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s a whole lot to feel ambivalent about these days. I’m sure you appreciate that. But you know what really strikes home when I think of that word? You know what picture illustrates <em class="calibre7">ambivalent</em> in this souped-up superconductor that used to be my brain?</p>
<p class="calibre20">My own guys. The backbones I fought side by side with. Grunts, regular army types. Even Chino, although he’d never admit it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Some of the shit they say, when they think I can’t hear them:</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">I dunno, man, looks to me like something</em> they’d <em class="calibre7">build</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">You think there’s anything inside at all? Anything human, I mean?</em></p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">That suit guy. I mean yeah, he saved our asses but Christ he creeps me out</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Chino had to keep telling them not to shoot at me. Had to keep reminding everyone whose side I was on. Even my kill card didn’t help. The more Ceph scalps I collected the scarier I became, somehow. Golem Boy, The Unkillable Monster That Even The Ceph Can’t Vanquish. If I’d been a little <em class="calibre7">less</em> good at my job—got an arm blown off or something—maybe they would’ve trusted me more.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Of course, if I’d really wanted to prove that I wasn’t unkillable, I suppose I could’ve let them know that I was already dead. Probably just as well I didn’t, though.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Oh, you think my feelings are hurt. That’s not it at all. I suppose there’s some little module down in my midbrain that’s feeling wounded and alone, but it doesn’t call the shots anymore. No, what I am is <em class="calibre7">concerned</em>. Because I really <em class="calibre7">don’t</em> look like <em class="calibre7">one of them</em>. The tech may be Ceph down in the molecules, but the morphology is all human. I don’t look like <em class="calibre7">one of them</em> at all; I look like one of <em class="calibre7">us</em> in weird-ass body armor.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But these guys, they see through that somehow. Maybe it’s pheromonal, maybe I smell wrong or something, but they sense a truth their eyes can’t possibly detect. They know who I am, they know we all wear the same dog tags. But something about me still freaks them out, right down in the brain stem. Even though they can’t put their fingers on it. And that, to me, is cause for concern.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Why, Roger, because we have things to do. And it’s going to be a lot tougher to do them if we can’t get people like you to trust us.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not to worry, though. We’re working on it.</p>
<p class="calibre27">The good times don’t last forever. The party screeches to a halt when Hargreave comes out of the closet.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Hopefully I’m reaching your comrades, too, with this,” he says when he comes back online. “I’ve bounced this signal off your suit to their comms.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">He’s reaching them all right. Chino’s tapping his earpiece like he’s trying to dislodge a bug. “Who the fuck is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“My name is Jacob Hargreave. You may or may not be aware that Alcatraz’s suit is evolving into a powerful bioweapon against the aliens you face. But in order to complete that process, a stabilizing agent is required. Ideally I would ask you to come to Roosevelt Island, but clearly that is impossible now.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Chino looks at me. “Is this a joke?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m feeling like my mom just showed up on the LAN in <a class="calibre21"></a>front of all the cool kids and asked me if I remembered to clean my room. But Mom is completely fucking oblivious; he announces that there’s an early prototype of said agent over at the Hargreave-Rasch building, right here in Midtown. He squirts coordinates: the familiar red line zigzags down wireframe canyons and comes to rest somewhere on East 36th.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Take your colleagues with you; you will need their support. Please make haste, all of you. The Ceph will not wait on us.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Nobody moves for a moment. Then someone says, “Did that civilian fuck just give us an <em class="calibre7">order</em>?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Chino looks around at the congregation. “Actually, I’m gonna read that as more of a <em class="calibre7">request</em>. And we <em class="calibre7">are</em> talking about something that’ll kill the Ceph.” Now he’s looking at no one but me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Aren’t we?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Ah, shit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I nod. I don’t know how well it comes across from the outside, but Chino takes it as a yes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We head out. Hargreave helps me pass the time, fills my eyes and ears with tactical intel on our destination. The main entrance to Hargreave-Rasch is blocked solid with rubble; the building itself is in lockdown. We might be able to get in through the parking garage, but the research wing is up on the eleventh floor and the stairwells and elevators are all locked out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">No problem, Hargreave says cheerily. The security console in the lobby’s still hot. Should be able to manage a systems reboot from there.</p>
<p class="calibre20">All things considered, we make good time. The wave may have smashed half of Manhattan down to the bricks, but it also pushed a lot of that wreckage into nice convenient moraines: a real cocksucker if they happen to be in your way, but if they’re not the streets are cleaner than they ever were when we backbones were running things. At least most of the bodies have been flushed out of sight. And those few corpses still tangled in trees, <a class="calibre21"></a>or skewered so far down signposts that not even a twenty-meter tidal wave could wash out the stain—even those are being taken care of. Ticks never sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre20">We come up from the south. I don’t know if our route has been uplifted or the Hargreave-Rasch block has dropped, but we’ve definitely got the high ground on approach: There’s a tumbledown escarpment of broken streets and buildings leading down to the south face. Hargreave wasn’t kidding when he said the entrance was blocked: collapsed and pulverized office towers jam the streets to either side and spill around into the space in front. You can barely see the tops of the southern doors under all that shit. The tactical wireframe shows another way in on the north side—at the bottom of a big cylindrical silo, like a castle turret, half embedded in the middle of the façade—and I think that’s actually the main entrance, but there’s no way we’re gonna get there from here.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s the parking ramp, though, off to the right, sloping down and out of sight right where it’s supposed to be. The only thing between it and us is about fifty Ceph on the ground and a dropship hanging overhead like a giant black scorpion.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Oh, <em class="calibre7">fuck</em>,” Chino grumbles.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Even as we watch that scorpion drops another egg onto the playing field, shoots it into the ground like a meteorite. Any one of us earthlings would have turned to jelly on impact. The Heavy that emerges from that shell doesn’t look anything but eager.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I remember enemy combatants, hesitating at my scent. I remember a stalker trying to shake my hand at the crash site, I remember a horde of Ceph waiting in ambush at Gould’s apartment. And now here they are again, waiting.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Are they really just swarming through the city like rats, or is it me?</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Fine.” Chino heaves a theatrical sigh. “We’ll cover your approach. Go in and get your fix, man. But make it fast.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“And if you <em class="calibre7">do</em> get out of there alive, drinks are on you for the rest of your fucking life.”</p>

<p class="calibre16">Chino and chums are as good as their word. They take the heat and I slip from cinder block to sewer pipe: cloaking as I cross the <a class="calibre21"></a>open spaces, uncloaking behind the shelter of a bakery truck or a pile of concrete, fading to black and sneaking to the next blind spot. Occasionally I pass too close to a grunt and it hesitates, sniffs, stutters trains of soft clicks into the air. I never let them see me, though, and they never press the issue. They’re too busy trying to kill my friends.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The ramp drops me below line-of-sight in an instant. I’m up to my knees in scummy water by the time I reach the corrugated door at the bottom. It’s jammed half open. I duck down and under. I’m up to my waist. The ramp continues down. I take another step. I’m up to my chest. The ceiling slopes down ahead of me, mindlessly parallel to the ramp beneath, and cuts off the airspace.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I wonder if maybe I’d be better off lending Chino a hand against the Ceph.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Jesus Christ, you fucking girlyman. It was twenty years ago. Get <em class="calibre7">over</em> it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I dive under, and push forward. The water pushes back, dark and dirty and full of swirling shit. The harder I stroke the thicker it gets; it kills my momentum, turns my reflexes to tar. I look up but there’s no surface overhead, just pipes and cement crossbeams and a few silvery bubbles sliding around like mercury. My inner eight-year-old is shitting bricks; the rest of me just hopes we make it through before I hit the rebreather’s immersion limit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">After about two hundred years the water starts to brighten up ahead; shafts of dirty gray light stab down onto two-lane asphalt, finally sloping back up. Now the surface is back; now the water’s low enough to stand in. It never recedes entirely—this whole level’s flooded—but it’s only up to my knees. I stand and my inner eight-year-old goes back to sleep. Suit clock tells me the whole trip took forty-five seconds but I guarantee, Roger, at least five minutes went by every time that second counter ticked over.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>Pylons and parking spots to one side; the cinder-block wall of a service closet to the other. Maybe sixty meters past that wall is a stairwell that should take me straight to the lobby.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I hear voices.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What the fuck. Hargreave said this place was <em class="calibre7">sealed</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Can’t hear the words. The voices float around the corner, low and easy, clarifying as I approach: the usual idle bullshit about hardware and poon. Maybe Hargreave sent a couple of grunts to meet me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You hear that?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I freeze. I cloak.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I’ll check it out. Hold your position.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Good plan. Split the party. Go off on your own.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gotta be CELL.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It is. He sloshes around the corner, the muzzle of his MP5 waving around like a stoned bumblebee. He pans toward me, through me, past me—</p>
<p class="calibre20">—stops, and looks again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’ve noticed by now: The cloak isn’t perfect. It turns you to something clearer than glass, but if you keep an eye out you can see the occasional refraction artifact in bright light. Even in semi-darkness there’s the barest bit of motion shimmer you might be able to pick out. If you know what to look for.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Let me tell you, this goon is looking <em class="calibre7">hard</em>, and I see it just before he does: the wake I’ve been kicking up as I move, that insignificant little bow ripple still playing itself out across the water’s surface.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But by then he’s opened fire, and lensing artifacts are the least of my worries.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m hit, he’s dead, the echoes of our conversation are still ringing off the walls and I hear bodies churning through the water just around the corner. Can’t count on the cloak down here. <a class="calibre21"></a>There’s a big box of circuit breakers hanging on the wall beside an abandoned Prius. I put out the lights. Someone yells “Switch to thermal!” and SECOND ccs me some local comm: “He’s in the building. Repeat: Prophet is in the building.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Game on.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can see the stairwell. At least I can see a bunch of body-temp false-color heat prints clustered around the exact spot where the stairwell’s supposed to be. They had me pegged, they knew just where I was going. Fuck, did Hargreave set me up? Who else, this is his building after all, he lured me in here, he’s got eyes on—</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Roger that. Kill order is in effect.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not Hargreave.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Lockhart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">He got in here somehow, snuck his people right under Hargreave’s nose. Hacked the telemetry or something. Lockhart, you stupid asshole, not Hargreave.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I circle away from the stairwell. Not nearly as many CELLulites guarding the elevator, and a couple of those fan out into the level as I watch: They know that only an idiot would use an <em class="calibre7">elevator</em> under these conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m too smart to be as smart as they expect; but I still leave two of them bleeding out in the disabled-parking zone. By the time I’m in the elevator and punching L, hostilities have spread beyond the local airwaves: Hargreave has broken into the freq, and he and Lockhart are having a slapfight all over the thirty-eight-megahertz band. Hargreave’s ordering Lockhart to stand down, Lockhart’s telling him to get stuffed. Lockhart says some not-very-nice things about me, too: <em class="calibre7">abomination</em> is the word he uses, I think. No big deal. Words will never hurt me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Sticks and stones, on the other hand. Not to mention our old friends Heckler and Koch …</p>
<p class="calibre20">The elevator decelerates smoothly to a stop at the lobby level. <a class="calibre21"></a>I kick the cloak back into gear and boost armor, flatten myself against the side of the car, crouch down.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They almost take me out anyway, the moment the doors open. It’s the view that does me in.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m underwater. The whole damn building is. I look out into that lobby, that turret, that grain silo I saw in the wireframes: It’s <em class="calibre7">glass</em>, the whole thing’s glass, a single vast cylindrical space ten stories tall. I look past a great sweeping arc of windowpanes onto the bottom of a lake: wrecked cars, sluggish clouds of suspended sediment, dim shapes in murky green water. I look up, up; wave-bottoms slop against the panes thirty meters above me. There’s all sorts of shit floating around up there: office furniture and cardboard boxes and big wooden telephone poles snapped like toothpicks.</p>
<p class="calibre20">This whole damn building—and the buildings beside it, and the chunks of buildings jammed up in the streets between—it’s a big piecemeal dam, holding back a deep pocket of floodwaters north of 36th. We came in from the downstream side, and it was just our good luck that the whole pile of junk didn’t give way and wash us out to sea like logs down the crapper before we even got here.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can’t help but wonder how long that luck is going to last. How long those <em class="calibre7">windowpanes</em> are going to last. Something creaks, way overhead: a billion tonnes of water looking for a way in.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And in those instants I’ve wasted staring like an idiot, they hose down the elevator with so much lead I take five random hits to the chest.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They don’t get through. They <em class="calibre7">do</em> knock me back against the wall of the elevator, though, and my head back into the game. Hazel Six has obviously called ahead for reservations, and invisibility isn’t much of an edge when every gun in the place knows you’re somewhere in a box two meters square. I crank the N2’s <a class="calibre21"></a>strength setting and jump into the lobby like a frog on a trampoline.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I take out two of those CELLulite fuckwits before I even hit the floor. But there are six left, my cloak is down, and public lobbies are not what you would call <em class="calibre7">rich in available cover</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I bounce off the wall, make it to the back side of the security desk, come down hard on some merc who evidently thought he had dibs on the spot. The air is fucking <em class="calibre7">incandescent</em> with crossfire, and I’m almost wishing that these guys were better shots because half the rounds that don’t hit me are smacking into the windows. Spiderwebs are cracking through the glass everywhere I look. I can’t believe the windows haven’t shattered yet.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fortunately, fragging CELL asses and covering my own is a full-time job. My inner eight-year-old can take a number. And believe it or not, when the dust finally settles and I am the Last Corpse Standing, that whole round wall of windows is <em class="calibre7">still</em> keeping the water at bay. Half a dozen panes are almost opaque, they’re so shot through with cracks; there are more trickles and rivulets and needles of spray than I can count. But there’s a whole orphaned chunk of the Atlantic leaning against those windows, and goddamn it, they’re <em class="calibre7">holding</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Lockhart’s gone offline. Or maybe he’s just sulking because I wiped the floor with his toy soldiers. Hargreave keeps the flame alive, though, riding my ass to reboot the upper-level elevators from the main desk. I still can’t take my eyes off the windows, off all that dark heavy water piled up on the other side, but Hargreave nags reassuringly in my ear: No need for concern, super-nanoglass, guaranteed floodproof. Go on, get over to the desk, reboot the system. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I go over to the desk. A couple of brain-dead monitors flash test patterns at me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something goes wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>I hear it before I see it. Glass against metal; ice cracking on the surface of a frozen lake. A sharp, cutting sound, halfway between a crack and a <em class="calibre7">ping</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Half a dozen windowpanes split from side to side. Water sprays in fine sheets of mist.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something’s moving out there in the murk, something <em class="calibre7">big</em>. I can’t even make out a silhouette; it’s hidden behind the mud and shit swirling up off the street.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Just past the front doors, three cars lift majestically off the bottom, turn slowly end-over-end, then settle back down in billowing clouds of mud.</p>
<p class="calibre20">More windows crack. Two trickles upgrade to <em class="calibre7">small waterfall</em> status. Inner eight-year-old’s eyes go wide, watching the water run down the inside of the panes; but then motion catches my eye again and drags it back down to street level.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Something’s standing on the bottom, just the other side of the glass. It towers over the muddy cumulus boiling around its legs. It looks in at me<em class="calibre7">—down</em> at me—with one glowing vertical slit of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It <em class="calibre7">crouches</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Every pane in front of the thing shatters in an instant. The ocean reaches in with big battering fists and takes me away.</p>
<p class="calibre27">The impact doesn’t knock me out this time. I wish it had.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I am deadwood, man. I am flotsam <em class="calibre7">and</em> jetsam. I am a fly on the goddamn jet stream, and I have no say at all in where I’m going.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe that saves my ass, I don’t know. Maybe if I <em class="calibre7">had</em> managed to fight the current I would’ve ended up skewered on rebar or wedged under a bus until my rebreather gave out. But I’m just a speck in the current, carried by a million tonnes of water following the path of least resistance; and water tends to <a class="calibre21"></a>flow <em class="calibre7">around</em> the rocks in the road, not <em class="calibre7">into</em> them. It fires me through doorways already smashed open, shoots me down halls and out broken windows, swings me around corners like a rag doll but it doesn’t smash me <em class="calibre7">into</em> anything. Way down in some sub-basement it finds a hole in the floor, slings me around it like a turd in a toilet bowl, flushes me down into a breached sewer pipe. Corrugated steel blurs past on all sides, and it goes on forever before spitting me out into—</p>
<p class="calibre20">—I don’t know where, exactly. Water spills over my shoulders in a brown cascade, loses steam, subsides to a trickle. There’s a strip of sky overhead, fractured walls of dirt and gravel and bedrock looming on either side. Now that the deluge has tapered off I hear water running in rivulets down a thousand cracks and crevices. I’m at the bottom of a tiny canyon, a rift in yet another Manhattan street that’s buckled and split and left me exposed like a grub dug out from under a rotten stump.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And all I can think is I made it, I made it. Dragged underwater, underground, away from air and sunlight, that stupid eight-year-old whiner inside trying to scream his fucking head off but I gagged him, I kept him down, I held it together. Not so scary this time; not fun by any stretch but at least I didn’t panic, didn’t even verge on it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The whole fear-of-drowning thing. I’m almost getting used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I listen to water lapping against concrete. I hear gulls screaming at one another. It’s almost peaceful. I close my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“What a goddamn mess. Now of all times; those boardroom idiots.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I keep my eyes closed. Maybe it’ll go away if I ignore it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Alcatraz, it seems I am facing a boardroom coup at the worst possible time. I can no longer control Lockhart or his forces. I am effectively under house arrest. And the Ceph are deploying in force. Until I can find some way to reverse this … palace revolution, <a class="calibre21"></a>our objectives are blocked. You must attempt to hold back the Ceph until I can stabilize the situation.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh, must I now.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Good luck, son—I will be in touch.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Take your time, old man. Don’t hurry on my account.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Wait: Chino.</p>
<p class="calibre20">If he got caught in that flood he could be nothing but teeth and strawberry jam by now. I wonder if—</p>
<p class="calibre20">An icon pops up center-right on the BUD: comm log from a restricted band. I sacc’ <span><span class="calibre9">PLAY</span></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Alcatraz, if you can hear me—listen, man, I’m sorry. We can’t hold here. Repeat, cannot hold here. The Squids are just <em class="calibre7">hammering</em> us. I’m pulling the squad back to Central Station. Get there if you can, man—we’re going to need you.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I check the timestamp: ten minutes before the dam broke. If they were lucky, they got clear in time. Weird, though. I didn’t know the N2 did voicemail. I wonder why I didn’t hear it live.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Wait a second: I didn’t say anything. I didn’t even sacc’ anything. All I did vis-à-vis Chino was <em class="calibre7">think</em> about the dude.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And you know, by this point I’m not even surprised anymore.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_30"></div>
