<p class="calibre16">Oh, Roger, the things I have seen.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Cities turned into swamps. Oceans on fire. Mobs so desperate to get out of the zone they barely even notice the razor wire slicing them open, so desperate for even a <em class="calibre7">chance</em> at clean water or a mouthful of freeze-dried <em class="calibre7">Spirulina</em> they’ll scale livewire fences, jerking like marionettes. I saw a woman’s hair catch fire halfway up and she just kept going because really, what did she have to lose? I’ve fed mass graves so big you could barely see the other side, so big you could see them from fucking orbit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then they sent me to Manhattan.</p>
<p class="calibre20">In one way, you know, it was almost a relief. To be picking on something your own size for a change, you know? Something that could fight back. <em class="calibre7">We</em> were the underdogs. We’d probably all end up dead or worse, but if we <em class="calibre7">didn’t</em>—if we actually survived, or even <em class="calibre7">won</em>—well, maybe for the first time in our lives we could feel <em class="calibre7">good</em> about winning. We were fighting a superior force for a change. We weren’t mowing down refugees.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Except when we were.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I remember running across my first—mop-up. Containment. Whatever word they used to whitewash the whole <em class="calibre7">massacre</em> thing. I’m climbing down off the rooftops, coming down a fire escape into this little cul-de-sac off William Street and there’s a pit dug into the road, lined with PVC. A couple of mercs are standing <a class="calibre21"></a>there shooting random civilians, and the cloak gets me close enough to hear them talking. They’re yucking it up because they don’t even have to go out hunting, you know, the civvies come to <em class="calibre7">them</em>, all of ’em heading the same way like salmon swimming upstream to sp—</p>
<p class="calibre20">What?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t give a flying fuck if they were infected. They were <em class="calibre7">civilians</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Yeah, that’s how they always justify it, isn’t it? Quarantine, protecting the population, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. All that shit. Let me tell you, these assholes were not racked by remorse over the <em class="calibre7">necessary evil</em> they were committing. They were <em class="calibre7">laughing</em>. They were using those poor bastards for <em class="calibre7">target practice</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">’Course, you’re trained that way. It’s an old trick. Never call them <em class="calibre7">civilians</em>, never learn their names. It’s tough to kill a fellow human being. In fact we make it a point to <em class="calibre7">never</em> kill human beings. We kill <em class="calibre7">niggers</em> and <em class="calibre7">ragheads</em> and <em class="calibre7">terrorists</em> instead. You know what they call infected civilians down in the zone, Roger? Pizza Pockets. Pukeheads. Because of the way they explode when you shoot them. Their insides are all pulpy, like rotten fruit.</p>
<p class="calibre20">When I saw those first few victims I assumed it was just some random alien fungus or something, you know, like that flesh-eating disease. But it’s more than that. It doesn’t just eat you, it doesn’t <em class="calibre7">just</em> turn you into a walking mass of tumors. First it <em class="calibre7">reprograms</em> you. It gives you purpose. Something to live for, something to die for. Some of those guys, you’d swear that getting raptured was the best thing that ever happened to them.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Sometimes I almost found myself feeling envious.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not everyone down there was CELL, of course. There were some good guys as well. Every now and then I’d see MPs or medics from the Red Cross trying to intervene, <em class="calibre7">Dude, it’s a meat-grinder in there, you keep going that way Squiddie will have</em>
<a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">you for appetizers</em>. But the infectees, they didn’t <em class="calibre7">care</em>. They <em class="calibre7">wanted</em> to meet the Squids, they <em class="calibre7">wanted</em> to be consumed, it was like their own personal ticket to sit at the right hand of Jesus H. Christ in the Great Hereafter. I even saw a couple of Bible-thumpers, they snuck into the zone on some kind of self-appointed missionary patrol. It was almost funny, watching them try to <em class="calibre7">un</em>save all these poor doomed bastards who’d got to “Heaven” before them. But those CELL goons, man, they weren’t interested in saving souls. All they were after was something to kill that wouldn’t fight back.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What do you think I did? We’re supposed to <em class="calibre7">protect</em> civilians, right? That’s the official job description at least. So I did my job. I blew those assholes away with extreme fucking prejudice, and I’d do it again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Chain of command, huh?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Is that the best you’ve got?</p>
<p class="calibre27">Anyway I keep on keeping on, closing on Gould, closing on Gould. He says it’s safer in the subway so I give it a shot, but it does not go well. Not all of the infected are pilgrims, you know, not all of them have seen the light. Some of them are sane enough to be scared shitless by what’s happening to them, some of them just need a dark place to hide and rot away. The subways are full of them: sobbing, suffering, telling anyone who’ll listen that it’s not that bad, they’re getting better, that they’ll be right as rain this time tomorrow. Some of them look almost as healthy as you; some aren’t much more than gurgling puddles of slime. And those scuttling things are everywhere, those tick-things I ran into back in the decon tunnel. They clatter around on jointed silver legs and jab those needle snouts into the bodies. They must inject some kind of acid or digestive enzyme because the stuff they suck back out looks more like pus and semen than blood and guts. It splatters like pus when you squash them. They’re easy enough to <a class="calibre21"></a>kill, the repulsive little fuckers. You crush them with your bare hands but there are so <em class="calibre7">many</em> of them. There’s just no point.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’ve had enough of that after about five minutes, take the next exit, climb back into the first daylight I can find. I end up on a pedestrian skywalk connecting a couple of office towers at the second floor. I’m about halfway across when I see a squad of CELLulites charging up the street below, waving their guns; I’m cloaked and down on my belly by the time they open fire; I’ve backed off a good ten meters before I realize they’re not even shooting at <em class="calibre7">me</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then something smashes through the walkway and I’m down on the street just like <em class="calibre7">that</em> and I stop worrying about the fucking mercs altogether.</p>
<p class="calibre20">My whole BUD’s flashing red. I’m flat on my back and the whole damn suit’s seized up. I’ve taken some kind of hit but nobody’s bothering to close for the kill; I’m nothing but collateral. The actual <em class="calibre7">target</em> screams past not ten meters overhead and I’d know what it was even if I wasn’t staring right up at it, even if I was <em class="calibre7">blind</em>, because I’ve only heard that sound once before: not eight hours ago, swimming for my life while my whole squad got cut down around me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Same two glowing hoops sticking out the sides. Must be some kind of antigravity thing, lift elements. Two rows of modules in between, about the size and shape of industrial cement mixers. Cylinder-cone things, lined up like eggs in a carton. The ship’s staggering through the airspace, weaving and wobbling, and part of that might be evasive maneuvers but I don’t care how <em class="calibre7">alien</em> this bird is, you can tell it’s wounded. It might as well be skywriting <span><span class="calibre9">HOLY SHIT I’M FUCKED</span></span> in black smoke.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And here comes the mofo that’s kicked its ass and its one of <em class="calibre7">ours</em>, it’s a goddamn <em class="calibre7">Apache</em>. A 64D, I think, not even bleeding-edge. I mean, this is a flying saucer we’re talking about—built by creatures from <em class="calibre7">another fucking solar system</em>—and it’s getting its ass <a class="calibre21"></a>handed to it by a bunch of apes in a ten-year-old helicopter. Fuck yeah. Somehow it’s got its nose back up, it’s climbing again, it <em class="calibre7">almost</em> clears the building down the street but not quite: skips off the edge like a stone on water, bounces back into the sky, but there are <em class="calibre7">three</em> Apaches on its tail now and they’re not giving up. One scores a direct hit just as the alien arcs away behind an office tower and I think that’s it, end of show—but a few seconds later it punches back into view, <em class="calibre7">right through the building</em>, leaves a glowing hole four stories high. I can see right through it to the cloud bank on the other side. This ship’s not going anywhere but <em class="calibre7">down</em>. It exits stage left, down some city canyon a few blocks ahead. Big orange flash. Smoke billows around the corner.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s like watching someone shoot down an X-35 with a slingshot.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould’s voice comes back to me as my suit reboots. “Did you fucking <em class="calibre7">see</em> that? I swear, it came down not five blocks from you!” He sounds like an eight-year-old girl who’s just gotten a pony for her birthday. “Dude, you <em class="calibre7">do</em> realize what this means, right? No one ever shot one of these things down before! This is our chance! This is it! There’ll be—I mean—let me think, just let me think …”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I do a little thinking myself. According to GPS, Gould’s in a warehouse all the way over on the East River. It’s just barely possible that he might have looked out his window and seen a tiny distant dot fall out of the sky—but how the hell does he know where I am in relation to it?</p>
<p class="calibre20">This isn’t just a comm link. Either this Gould fucker has access to high-rez realtime satcam surveillance, or the N2’s putting out some kind of homing signal. I wonder if it’s encrypted. I wonder if Lockhart knows the key.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“—to jump on this,” Gould’s saying. “Extraction can wait—go get me some samples. This could be <em class="calibre7">it</em>, man: a shot at rolling back <a class="calibre21"></a>the spore, maybe even the whole invasion. I’ll hold for you here. But move your ass. Lockhart’s going to have CELL swarming all over that crash site in nothing flat.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can still hear helicopters buzzing from somewhere in the streets ahead. That little blue hexagon that was pointing the way to Gould’s lab jumps west, miraculously recalibrated to the bearing of the crash site. I couldn’t find Gould now if my life depended on it; it was so easy just following the waypoints I never bothered to memorize the route.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I may be the one moving these arms and legs, but somehow Gould and the N2 are the ones deciding where they take me. And I’m starting to feel a little like a passenger in my own skin, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But you bounce pretty high after cheating death, Roger. Just a few hours back I <em class="calibre7">knew</em> I was dying, I could feel myself dying down to the last cell: no denials, no reprieve, this is <em class="calibre7">it</em>, dude. And when you come to those kind of terms and then come out the other side—look death in the face and <em class="calibre7">beat</em> the fucker against impossible odds, you feel—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Invulnerable. That’s the word. Invulnerable.</p>
<p class="calibre20">After all, Prophet took a shell to the chest wearing these threads, and he stayed standing. So yeah, I’m feeling like the last son of Krypton, and there’s a <em class="calibre7">crashed alien ship</em> just a few blocks away. Who wouldn’t want to check that out?</p>
<p class="calibre20">I know I’m being led by the nose. But the truth is I’d have probably headed over to take a look anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre27">Manhattan’s been carved into a jigsaw.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not the aliens’ doing. It’s not even the random chaos of collapsing buildings and seismic tremors. It’s <em class="calibre7">us</em>. Ten thousand slabs of concrete have been slotted together and laid across the <a class="calibre21"></a>cityscape like interlocking dominoes ten meters high, and every last one has <span><span class="calibre9">CELL</span></span> stamped across it in big black letters. The whole zone’s been partitioned into a hundred irregular cookie-cutter shapes. The last time I saw this much cement in such a small area, it was being used to keep Israelis and Palestinians from tearing each other’s throats out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">This particular barricade cuts right across the middle of Broad Street. The nearest storm-sewer grating is about twenty meters back from a massive corrugated gate topped by a scrolling marquee that endlessly repeats <span><span class="calibre9">LOWER</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre9">MANHATTAN SEALED OFF</span></span> in block capitals. I pry off the grille and drop below the street; five minutes later I’m cloaked and flattened against a savings and loan on East Houston, leaning around the corner into the sound of helicopters and idling APCs.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Way to go on the whole partitioned-containment thing, guys.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I think this used to be some kind of open-air plaza. Right now it’s a smoking hole, a ragged cutaway model ripped open to show the cracked stacked levels of an underground parking garage. If there’s a ship buried down there under all those cement floes, it’s too deep for me to make out. I can see three of those cylindrical pods scattered around, though: half buried in the street, face-planted in an urban flower patch, taking the absolute piss out of a dozen tables on a café patio. Strip away some of that weird Ceph chrome and they almost <em class="calibre7">could</em> have come off the backs of cement trucks.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A helicopter drifts back and forth over the center of the tableau. I see a couple of APCs parked in front of a deli, and over across the crater half a dozen ammo and supply crates have been stacked along the wall of the elevator hutch that must have been the main pedestrian parkade access before the Ceph pioneered the whole open-access approach. Maybe a dozen CELLulites wander the perimeter. A few more hump kit from the APCs to the elevator cache.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>My cloak’s almost drained. I pull back around the corner as Gould natters on about checking the pods. “We’re looking for tissue samples, dead crew.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Yeah, and the couple of dozen assorted mercs over there are looking for <em class="calibre7">me</em>, even with a flying saucer buried under their feet: “Keep your eyes peeled for that Nanosuit asshole. The way they’re talking, he’s more trouble than the Ceph.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I cloak up, cross the ten meters to the <span><span class="calibre9">OVERPRICED PARKING: IN ONLY</span></span> ramp, hop the guardrail, and drop down behind the interlocked front ends of a Taurus and a Malibu that couldn’t seem to agree on traffic flow. I risk decloaking, let the charge rebuild while unsuspecting uniforms above my head fill the air with chatter.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“You picking anything up on the scanner?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Nah, looks like they ejected before impact. We’re just waiting for the cleanup crew.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“If they ejected, where the hell did they go?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Good question.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">It is, too. I add it to the list as I recloak and start down the ramp; if the pods are a bust, maybe I can sneak into the crater from one of the garage levels. By the time the money shot comes I’m so far down that I almost miss it:</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Christ, that thing’s buried deep. Only way down is through the elevator shaft.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So the good news is, there may be a way to get Gould his samples: <em class="calibre7">Could be</em> it, <em class="calibre7">man, a shot at rolling back the spore, maybe even the whole invasion</em>. Rah.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Bad news is, it’s on the far side of the plaza in the middle of a crowd of trigger-happy mercs stationed right next to a fresh stock of ammunition, who have orders to shoot me on sight.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">Worst</em> news, though, is that I’m hearing at least four sets of boots approaching the bottom of the ramp ahead of me, and <a class="calibre21"></a>there’s no fucking way I can get all the way back up before my cloak runs dry.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I love it when the number of options dwindles to one. Really speeds up the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They hear me before they see me; the cloak is good, but it doesn’t mask the sound of boots charging down a concrete ramp at thirty klicks an hour. They stop talking, their guns come up, and suddenly I’m <em class="calibre7">right there</em>, laying shotgun blasts into all that Kevlar, bringing the Marshal down like a club on those shiny gray helmets, grabbing one of them by the throat and watching her sail through space until a convenient support pylon takes her from sixty to zero in no seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Shouts from deeper within the garage. Panicked calls for back-up on comm. I’m coming for them. They know it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But I’m not. I recloak, swap the Marshal out for a recently orphaned assault rifle and head back up the ramp. Strength is amped so I’m moving <em class="calibre7">fast</em>, but between that and the cloak every capacitor in the suit’s gonna run dry in about three seconds. Make that two: I pull a boosted jump over the reinforcements clattering down the ramp, six eager little sociopaths don’t see me coming and don’t see me go but that last mighty leap took me down to the fumes and I materialize from thin air as I pass above their heads. I don’t think they saw that I hope they didn’t see that, their eyes were down and focused on the forward charge, but no time to look it’s all in the past and I’m rising up to ground level now, I’ve got a chopper overhead and a whole shitload of hostiles coming around that crater (two, four, seven, eight, <em class="calibre7">nine targets</em> SECOND tells me, and lays neat little ranges and targeting triangles over each). I deke and I duck but it’s not enough to keep me from taking hits; and even though the suit can handle them it just <em class="calibre7">kills</em> the capacitor feed, the power bar stutters to a crawl on its way up the recharge trail.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>HMG fire from the chopper. I lob a grenade into the sky and the pilot pulls back—an unnecessary reflex, that little pineapple doesn’t even come close, but it’s enough to throw the gunner off his aim. I hit the deck and roll behind a waist-high concrete planter holding a row of spindly stunted trees. The grenade bounces and rolls and blows out the windows of the deli.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Eight seconds, tops, before they flank me.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The charge bar tops up at six. I fade, roll away from the planter, get to my feet. I’ve noticed that the cloak lasts a lot longer when the suit isn’t pulling power for a lot of other things. I can stay invisible for forty-five seconds, maybe a whole minute if I just stand still.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Maybe almost as long if I just move very, <em class="calibre7">very</em> … slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I amble sideways while the air fills with shouts of <em class="calibre7">Lost the target</em> and <em class="calibre7">Shit he’s cloaked again</em>. I line up my approach: five long steps to the edge of the crater on turbo, then maybe fifteen meters to cross the gap near the left edge. I amp strength to max and <em class="calibre7">move</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I nail the launch: solid traction, boots leave the ground maybe twenty centimeters from the edge, and the moment I’m airborne I drop strength right back to baseline. I sail over that gap like a ghost.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And nearly blow the landing. My feet come down with no room to spare. I land just past the lip of the hole and <em class="calibre7">wobble</em> back and forth, windmilling my arms to keep from falling over. No time to worry about the sound of my boots on the pavement; if the rotors and the shouts and the random suppressing fire didn’t mask it I’m probably fucked.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But here I am, ten meters from the elevators, and all that stands in my way are three CELLulites left to guard the supplies. That running jump burned through two-thirds of my charge, but for the moment I’m still stealthed.</p>
<p class="calibre20">These boys are not convinced. Last time they saw me I was <a class="calibre21"></a>on the other side of the plaza, but I could be anywhere by now. I could be <em class="calibre7">right in front of them</em>. How would they know?</p>
<p class="calibre20">They’ll know soon enough. They’ll know in about three seconds, because the charge bar’s just started flashing red. I bring up the Grendel: not the best accuracy and a downright shitty clip size, but these tungsten rounds would stop a rhino and my targets are almost close enough to touch.</p>
<p class="calibre20">They see my face, and blow apart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not completely clear sailing after that. Their buddies can’t wait to lay down the law now that I’m back in their worldview, and the elevator doors are jammed. I have to finesse my way in, and it seems like I have to fend off a whole fucking platoon in the process. By the time I get those doors jimmied open, drop the twenty meters to the bottom of the shaft, and take care of anyone who tries to follow little Timmy down the well—we’re looking at a final score of somewhere around seventeen–zip.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Like I said before. That’s what you get when you work nine-to-five.</p>
<p class="calibre27">The bottom of the shaft is chest-deep in scummy water; a service crawlway leads off to the north, a half-flooded mess of ruptured plumbing, soggy cardboard crates, and the occasional pulpy corpse. Dim lights glow here and there in rusty little cages, antique bulbs with actual filaments inside. I bet they’ve been down here since the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s brighter light farther down the passage, though. I follow it to a hole torn in the ceiling, duck under an exposed I-beam, and climb a pile of cinder blocks and shattered tiles to another Ceph pod; it rammed down into this space at a forty-five-degree angle, and is half buried by collapsed ceiling and uprooted floor.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And it’s—bleeding, or something.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The pod’s ruptured in several spots. The stuff oozing from <a class="calibre21"></a>those wounds is the color of snot or old candle wax, and it’s <em class="calibre7">everywhere:</em> running in ropy strings along the hull, pooling on the screen, hanging in thick gooey stalactites from the breached ceiling. It <em class="calibre7">moves</em>. It—undulates. Or maybe that’s just the light: I look around for the first time and see the far end of the room, relatively unscathed behind me. A floor lamp, knocked on its side, throws light across the space at a low angle, full of contrast and long shadows. So, yeah: probably just a trick of the light. But I can’t shake the feeling that those giant hanging boogers <em class="calibre7">squirm</em> just the slightest bit, as if I’m looking at a thin-walled brood sac with some kind of half-seen larva incubating inside.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“That’s it,” Gould says on comm. “You gotta scan that stuff.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Scan? But SECOND’s training wheels take their own initiative: broad-spectrum chemical sensors built into the fingertips, according to the graphical thumbnails popping up on BUD. I saccade the right dropdowns, switch to tactical—remind myself it won’t actually be <em class="calibre7">me</em> touching this shit—and lay on the hands.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The N2’s fingertips leave soft depressions in the alien snot. Almost instantly lists of ingredients start scrolling down my brain: chemical formulae I somehow recognize as organic even though I can barely remember high school chemistry. Amine groups. Polysaccharides. Glycolipids.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Why is this ringing so many bells?</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s ringing bells for Gould, too. I hear him trying to keep his lunch down across a whole borough and a shitload of static. “Jesus, man, that’s—that’s <em class="calibre7">people</em>. Just melted down, just—just <em class="calibre7">lysed</em>. What the fuck is this?”</p>
<p class="calibre20">I remember pus spurting from squashed ticks. Odd that Gould doesn’t seem to know about that.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“I can’t do anything with this. We struck out. You better get out of there before CELL shows up. Back to Plan A.”</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>He doesn’t even say lab. Waypoints and objectives reset themselves anyway. God<em class="calibre7">damn</em> this suit is smart.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Going back up the elevator shaft is a nonstarter. I climb over the wreckage into the other end of the room: some kind of security or janitorial office, judging by the desk and the filing cabinets. A row of windows on the opposite wall looks out into what used to be the lower parking level; now it looks onto a slope of collapsed concrete, sloping up toward a thin slice of sky. The glass is caged behind one of those antiburglary grilles.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Yeah. Right.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I start up the slope. No comm chatter: That’s odd. Maybe CELL’s figured out that I’m hacking into their frequencies.</p>
<p class="calibre20">No rotor noise, either. That’s odder.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Almost there.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I stop. Look right. Nothing. Left. Nothing. Up: just sky.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Forward.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Oh <em class="calibre7">shi—</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">It jumps down on me from nowhere, slams me facedown into the rubble, flips me over onto my back and pins me there. It’s a nest of naked black backbones spliced together into something that almost looks humanoid. It’s got backbones for arms, spiky segmented things that end in—hands, I guess you’d call them. Claws. I can’t get a good look at them, they’re pressed down against my shoulders but they seem way too big, like catcher’s mitts on a stick man. There’s another backbone where a backbone <em class="calibre7">should</em> be, connecting those arms to a set of armored robodog legs with too many joints. There’s something on top, a helmet for a head like the front of a bullet train with clusters of orange eyes on each side. There’s a blob of boneless gray tissue in the middle of it all.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s like my bogeyman from the roof, but different. <em class="calibre7">Meaner</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I try to move but the fucker’s <em class="calibre7">strong</em>, man, I can’t throw it <a class="calibre21"></a>off and my gun’s been knocked halfway across the rubble. One backbone-arm pulls back like it’s winding up for a punch, and that long metal mitt just <em class="calibre7">splits open</em> to reveal more drills and needles and probes than a goddamn dentist’s chair on steroids. Something whirls from the middle of that cluster and spears me in the chest. The BUD jumps; my icons scramble; my eyeballs fill with static.</p>
<p class="calibre20">The N2 starts <em class="calibre7">talking</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s not False Prophet. It’s not English. It’s not even human, it’s just—gibberish. Clicks, hiccups, these weird <em class="calibre7">hooting</em> sounds. And the shit I’m suddenly seeing on tactical isn’t making any more sense, green pastel suddenly flickering into orange and purple, alphanumerics turning into hieroglyphics, and what do you call those blobs you headshrinkers used to use before we laughed you out of town?—Rorschach blots. That’s it. The whole interface is fried and I’m stuck there for I don’t know how long, can’t be more than a few seconds but it seems like forfuckingever.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then False Prophet <em class="calibre7">does</em> speak up, and at least he’s speaking human even though I don’t know exactly what he’s talking about. He says:</p>
<p class="calibre33"><em class="calibre7">Interface attempted. Tissue vector 11 percent</em>.<br class="calibre8"/><em class="calibre7">Insufficient common code. Rejecting</em>.</p><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<p class="calibre20">And the alien leaps off me and darts away like <em class="calibre7">I</em> was the bogeyman.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Gould comes back to me as the BUD sobers up: “You had it, man! You triggered sampling mode, but it didn’t—listen, Prophet, whatever you just did: Do it again!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Right. Chase down the nice monster and sweet-talk it into skewering me a second time. That’s gonna happen.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“Come <em class="calibre7">on</em>, man, quit messing around! We don’t have time!”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Who am I kidding.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I grab my weapon and take up the chase. I put everything the suit’s got into speed; I sprint in turbocharged bursts, huff and puff in between with my own measly muscles while the charge builds back. And wouldn’t you know the alien’s back in my sights: now leaping along on two legs, now running like a cheetah on four, sometimes keeping to the street, sometimes scrambling up sheer walls like a caffeinated gecko. This thing isn’t biped or quad, it’s not a runner or a climber; it’s <em class="calibre7">all</em> of those things, it’s fluid, it morphs between modes as easily as I put one foot after the other. It’s almost beautiful, the way it moves. It <em class="calibre7">is</em> beautiful, and fast, but you know what? This fuck-ugly Nanosuit, this bulky pile of cords and chrome—it’s keeping up, it’s one step forward and three steps back but that forward step is a <em class="calibre7">doozie</em> and suddenly I’m close enough to bring the fucker down. I’m twenty meters back when it pulls a sudden right-angle turn up off the street and starts climbing the walls. I fire on the run, thank whatever gearhead designed the N2’s motion stabilizers, and I don’t know if it’s a lucky shot or old cement but suddenly the bricks are crumbling under the Ceph’s claws and it falls backward off the wall, live parts and machine parts both grabbing at the air, both coming up empty, and the whole bastard meat–machine hybrid crashes down on the asphalt not five steps from where I’m waiting. It springs back up almost immediately but I’m already blasting away at the soft parts inside the hard ones and I don’t care <em class="calibre7">how</em> fast your spaceships go, if you’re made out of meat you are <em class="calibre7">not</em> coming back from a point-blank encounter with a Grendel heavy assault rifle.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There’s enough Squid splattered across my front that I don’t even need to punch through the exoskeleton; all I have to do is wipe my hand across my chest and False Prophet pipes up, <a class="calibre21"></a>“Sample absorbed. Processing.” I watch the N2’s fingertips slurp up that alien gore like a sponge drinks a coffee spill. I can’t tell you how creepy I find this.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I find it so creepy I don’t even notice the other stalkers coming down the walls at me.</p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div>
