<p class="calibre16">Holy <em class="calibre7">shit</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">What do I, what just—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fuck fuck <em class="calibre7">fuck</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">A cheery little overlay pops up while Prophet’s blood and gray matter trickle down my faceplate: <span><span class="calibre9">CN COMBAT SOLUTIONS. NANOSUIT 2.0</span></span>. Suddenly I can’t move. I’m in the middle of some kind of war zone, my entire squad has been massacred by a flying saucer from Zeta fucking Reticuli (there: I said it), the one guy who might have been able to give me some answers now ends at the mandible, and my magical new dream suit has stuck me in place like an ant in amber. Something’s stomping around on the roof, acting in no way scared or cautious or the least bit worried about being discovered. Which only goes to emphasize how very much <em class="calibre7">I</em> should be feeling all those things.</p>
<p class="calibre20">On the plus side—if you can call it that—I’m not dead. And according to the medical diagnostics racing across my field of view, I should be. My back is broken in three places. My larynx is crushed. My femoral artery is torn. There’s more blood in my lungs than air. The list goes on. Nanosuit 2.0’s rattling off diagnostic and wet-repair capabilities like I’ve never seen outside a full-blown VA hospital—and while it’s got me rooted in place like a garden gnome, it’s also pumping me full of antibodies and autocatalytic fibrinogen and a dozen kinds of engineered osteoblasts <a class="calibre21"></a>to knit my bones back together. All things considered, immobilized in a custom-fitted body cast is not a bad place to be right now.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Just as long as I’m not immobilized when the bad guys come calling.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Eventually the biotelemetry slows to a drizzle. Scenery peeks out from behind the stats; the BUD gives up all the visual real estate except for a dusting of ice-green icons scattered around the edge of vision. Nanosuit 2.0 reports that it has <span><span class="calibre9">INTEGRATED NEW DNA PROFILE</span></span>, and unlocks.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I can move again.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And something up on the roof is just <em class="calibre7">waiting</em> for me to do that. Every now and then it stomps on the iron sheeting just in case I’ve forgotten, like the bogeyman who pushes just a little bit harder on that one squeaky stair outside your bedroom door. He <em class="calibre7">wants</em> you to know he’s out there.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I <em class="calibre7">know</em>, already. I step over what’s left of Prophet—roaches scuttle away from my shadow, the place is infested with them—and scoop up his pistol. BUD snaps a tactical silhouette around its edges, serves up an ID: <span><span class="calibre9">M12 NOVA AUTO LIGHT PISTOL</span></span>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Empty. I fucking <em class="calibre7">hate</em> it when people use the car and return it without any gas.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Stomp. Clatter. More dust settles from the rafters.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Welcome to the end of the world, marine.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">It’s just a chip voice buzzing in my ear, but I jump anyway. I run my eyes over tactical, looking for some kind of comm link. Each icon brightens in turn as I focus on it. Saccadal interface. Cool.</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Everything’s online,” the voice tells me. “The N2 is functioning within normal parameters.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not comm. Suit AI. A bit of fuzz in the upper registers. Damaged speaker, maybe.</p>
<p class="calibre20">It sounds like Prophet.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>“There’s been some minor structural damage to the intercostals and the Ballard-stack couplings; estimated time to suit repair is twenty-six minutes. Estimated time to host repair is unavailable at this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Scratch that; it sounds like something <em class="calibre7">trying</em> to sound like Prophet. You can recognize the impression, but it’s not gonna fool anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I look around for another gun, a knife. A board with a nail in it. My surroundings sink in for the first time: some kind of dockside warehouse. I’m in an aisle formed by two rows of big green shipping containers, stacked to each side, unmarked except for the red cross decaled across the door of each. No weapons. The floor’s littered with spent casings, so there could be fresh ammo nearby at least. The aisle dead-ends against a wall about ten meters in front of me. There’s a little fire flickering down there, a pile of smashed wooden shipping flats that’s just about burned itself out. Filtered sunlight spills over the top of the cargo pods to my left. It looks like there’s a way out down at the other end of the aisle, a gap between the pods and a stack of big wire cages that look like giant mutant shopping carts stuffed with rags. There’s a bad transformer or breaker box down there, too, judging by the buzzing.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I start moving. The thing on the roof starts moving, too.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I think it’s tracking me. I think—</p>
<p class="calibre20">I think those aren’t rags.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t think that’s a bad transformer.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Fuck.</p>
<p class="calibre20">There are feet sticking out of those cages. Arms. Some look almost normal, some are wormy with rootlets and tumors. Something glistens from the shadows in all that clothing; before I’m close enough to make it out I already know it’s looking at me. And it is. There’s a nice clean bullet hole in the forehead right <a class="calibre21"></a>above it. Flies crawl and buzz and do little joyous loop-the-loops around the windfall.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I look down at casings scattered around the floor like leaves in fucking autumn. Standard military issue.</p>
<p class="calibre20">Not one of these people is in uniform. At least two are wearing surgical scrubs.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I’m running so short of headspace to process all the nightmares—hostile aliens, savior suicide, the Thing On The Roof, and now a massacre of goddamn <em class="calibre7">civilians</em>?—that I almost don’t notice the bright new icon blinking upper-left. All that registers at first is a sense of minor irritation, some vague tugging at the back of my mind. I stand there like a moron for a good five seconds before I notice the damn thing flashing at the corner of my eye. But the moment I focus, it jumps front-and-center and starts talking:</p>
<p class="calibre20">“Find Gould. Nathan Gould. It’s all I can do now, <em class="calibre7">you’re</em> all I can do. I’m sorry, man. I’m so fucking sorry. It’s all on you now.”</p>
<p class="calibre20">Text crawls across my eyeball—</p>
<p class="calibre33">Gould, Nathan.<br class="calibre8"/>89 South St #17, New York, NY</p><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">—and my first reaction is <em class="calibre7">Are you fucking KIDDING? Who GIVES a shit?</em></p>
<p class="calibre20">But Prophet has charged me with a sacred quest, and maybe I <em class="calibre7">can</em> just turn around and walk away from that. But then again, maybe I can’t. The only reason I’m alive now is because of the man lying dead at my back; and my life came with a price tag attached. Besides. I’m cut off from my chain of command, my squad’s been exterminated, and I have no fucking clue why any of this is happening. Nathan Gould is a place to start, at least. He’s bound to have some answers. Let’s go talk to nice Mr. Gould.</p>
<p class="calibre20"><a class="calibre21"></a>What else am I going to do? Count the dead?</p>
<p class="calibre20">Except it turns out I’m locked in. The windows are barred and out of reach, way up near the ceiling. Every door’s been welded shut and backed up with weighted cargo containers. Some of the blockage is pure battlefield entropy but most of it’s been deliberately barricaded against whatever’s got the high ground outside. I climb over sandbags and body bags, I kick open shipping crates and rummage through lockers. I find two bodies in hazmat suits, I find overturned tables, I find microscopes and thermocyclers and those spinning things, what do you call them, <em class="calibre7">centrifuges</em> smashed and scattered across the fractured cement. I even find a couple of usable ammo clips, but wherever I go those scary metal footsteps seem to follow me around up there. Although they’re not <em class="calibre7">exactly</em> footsteps. It sinks in after a while; the rhythm’s all wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But there has to be some kind of way out of here because after all, Prophet brought me <em class="calibre7">in</em>, right? Only I’m not finding it. And whatever cocktail the N2 fed into my brain is not all it could be, because the obvious answer has been stomping around over my head for the past twenty minutes and I was either too stupid or too chickenshit to see it.</p>
<p class="calibre20">But yeah. Eventually I figure it out.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And I swear to God, I can hear the bogeyman dancing an eager little jig of joy as I start climbing the stairs.</p>

</span></div><div class="calibre32"> </div>
<p class="calibre16">So this is how it is. No cutesy musical sign language, no guys with bumpy foreheads saying <em class="calibre7">Resistance Is Futile</em> or <em class="calibre7">Kneel Before Zod</em>, no sexy alien hive queens keeping our hero busy with butt sex while her minions turn our children into veal cutlets. No small talk at all, unless you count the sound it makes when it sees me: <a class="calibre21"></a>kind of a stuttering hollow croak, like a cheap voice synthesizer trying to gargle.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then ET <em class="calibre7">brings</em> it, motherfucker.</p>
<p class="calibre20">In that first second I’m surprised by how human it looks. Sure, the legs have too many joints and the arms don’t have any—more like segmented tentacles with hands, like Doc Ock from Spider-Man—but there’s two of each, right where they’re supposed to be. Kind of a helmet on top with two compound clusters of orange lights where you’d expect eyes. It’s all metal, though, so I’m thinking either <em class="calibre7">robot</em> or <em class="calibre7">armor</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">And then it fires, point-blank, and I’m flat on my back and I should be dead but I’m not. In the next second it’s on me like a fucking panther and I can see the meat <em class="calibre7">inside</em> all that metal: grayish, translucent, like a jellyfish. Dim brownish orange blobs deep inside that have to be organs, four thick fleshy tentacles flailing out the back. And one part of me’s thinking <em class="calibre7">What the hell kind of armor leaves your guts exposed</em>, but another part’s thinking <em class="calibre7">Those guts are the last thing you’re ever gonna see, asshole</em>—because I’m already <em class="calibre7">down</em>, man, without firing a shot, it caught me flat-footed and flipped me like a bug on its back. And it should be game over right there, but then it just—</p>
<p class="calibre20">Hesitates. Bobs its head, or whatever you call that wedge-shaped thing with the lights. We almost get the sense it’s sniffing the air, trying to get a fix on some strange new smell. And that little hesitation, that one or two seconds’ grace—that’s enough for a comeback. We grab that fucker by the horns, we jam—</p>
<p class="calibre20"><em class="calibre7">I</em>, of course. I mean <em class="calibre7">I</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I grab that fucker by the horns, I jam my pistol into the gray goo and start firing. The thing pulls away, makes this <em class="calibre7">whistling</em> sound—cold, winter-wind sound—and I’m back up just like <em class="calibre7">that</em>, the alien brings its weapon up again but I block, I jab, I don’t even think about it. The suit’s got its own reflexes, force multipliers, <a class="calibre21"></a><em class="calibre7">motion</em> multipliers. Turns a flinch into a right hook. It barely waits for me to move before responding, I could almost swear it’s moving <em class="calibre7">me</em>. I lift that alien motherfucker over my head and pitch it off the roof like I was throwing a Hacky Sack.</p>
<p class="calibre20">So much for the bogeyman, bitch. So much for the monster under the bed. So much for the thing in the closet.</p>
<p class="calibre20">I don’t know what Prophet was going on about. This suit is fucking <em class="calibre7">awesome</em>.</p>
