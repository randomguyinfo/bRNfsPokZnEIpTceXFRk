<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_8">*Chapter 7*: Chapter 7</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">Chapter Seven*</p><p class="calibre7">A few hours later they stood on platform 9 Â¾ at Kings Cross Station saying their goodbyes to Molly. They lifted their trunks onto the train and began to look for a compartment. All seemed to be full until at last they came across one where Luna, Neville and to Harry's dislike, Cho Chang sat. Neville and Luna occupied the seats closest to the windows while Cho sat next to Neville. They looked up when the trio entered the compartment.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hello." Luna said airily as Ron took the seat next to her.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry could have hexed Ron at that moment. Now the only two seats left, the one next to Ron, and the one next to Cho. Harry looked around; Cho caught his eye and smiled then motioned to the seat next to her. Harry looked at Ginny before reluctantly taking a seat. Ginny gave him a pouting look before sitting next to Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">After a few minutes in silence, Cho turned to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Isn't it so nice of professor McGonagall to ask us to come back Harry? I feel so honored." Cho smiled sweetly. "Maybe one day during our free periods we can go down to Hogshead and have lunch together." She smiled bigger and gingerly placed a hand on Harry's leg. He felt his stomach turn, he turned to look at Ginny, her face was enraged and her fist clenched. He turned back to Cho.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, sorry I don't think that would be such a good idea." He tried to scoot away from her but it just caused her to move closer.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh why not Harry, you just need to relax. Get out, have some fun." She moved her hand further up his leg and placing her other on his upper arm. He turned to her and she smiled and nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"RON. Switch me seats." Harry yelled louder than necessary.</p><p class="calibre7">"Huh?" Ron said looking up from the article Luna had been showing him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh okay." Ron got up and switched. Harry had barely sat down and Ginny had her hands all over him. She put her hand higher on his leg than Cho had and smirked at Cho when Harry did not push it away. Cho's face suddenly became very twisted and she crossed her arms angrily. Ginny just brighter and leaned her head against Harry's chest.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your cruel." Harry whispered to her. She just smiled up at him. "Why whatever do you mean Harry?" She said innocently.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's good to see you back together," Neville piped up.</p><p class="calibre7">"For some of you." Ron muttered under his breath.</p><p class="calibre7">"What was that?" Neville asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think what he means," Luna began calmly "Is that even though we are all very happy about Harry and Ginny being back together, he particularly doesn't enjoy seeing certain," she paused for a moment in thought, then nodded "Aspects of their relationship." After she finished talking she lifted her magazine back up and went back to reading.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry had to chuckle at how spot-on Luna was, she always seemed to know exactly what was going on, even when it appeared that she wasn't paying attention.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked down as Ginny began to yawn. "I'm tired." She breathed before laying her head down on his lap. Harry sucked in his breath as he realized how close her head was to certain parts of him. He was afraid she would notice how<em class="calibre9"> umm</em> excited he was and freak out, but after a few moments of her not moving his worries began to fade.</p><p class="calibre7">An hour passed before a very excited Dennis Creevey bounded into the compartment. "Luna! Why aren't you ready?" He asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">Luna looked up from her magazine, then down at her watch. "Oh yeah." She said nonchalantly. She got up, grabbed her robes and started to head out of the compartment. As she walked Harry noticed the badge on her robes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Luna you're a prefect?" He questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why yes Harry, and I nearly forgot." She blushed unnaturally. "You should be getting into you robes soon." She opened the door and skipped out of the compartment and down the hall after Dennis.</p><p class="calibre7">"Best get our robes down." Ginny sat up and Harry was glad that his 'happiness' had subsided a bit. She stood on the bench fumbling inside of her truck, from where Harry was sitting, he could just almost see up her skirt, he was tempted to crane his neck around for a better view but was afraid Ron would notice. She pulled out her robes and dropped them to the floor.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry do you want me to get yours down for you too?" She asked a little too sweetly. He nodded, he was enjoying this view way too much for her to sit back down so soon.</p><p class="calibre7">Then Ginny did something Harry had not expected. She swiftly placed her left foot on the other side of him so that she stood straddling him while she fumbled around in his trunk. Harry let out a low moan as his heart began to race. He felt his blood rushing and his 'excitement' returning. He could have sworn she was swaying her hips just to torment him. He was about to grab hold of her when he looked over at Ron, he was glaring at Harry as if mentally saying <em class="calibre9">'I dare you'</em>.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry decided it would just be better to enjoy the view when everything went black; Ginny had dropped his robes on top of his head. Before he could untangle himself from the fabric, she had already taken her seat and was buttoning her robes. Harry gave a small whimper and she smiled at him then turned to smile again at Cho Chang.</p><p class="calibre7">Soon they arrived at the Hogsmead station. They selected a carriage, and very much to his aversion, Cho followed the rest of them aboard. Even with the seemingly outward notices that he did not fancy her anymore and was with Ginny, she was still determined to sit next to him and run her hand along his thigh. Harry though at any second Ginny was going to hex Cho, so he just ignored it and focused all his attention on keeping Ginny from getting a detention her first day back.</p>
