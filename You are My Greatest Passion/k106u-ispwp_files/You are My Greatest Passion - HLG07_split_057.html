<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_58">*Chapter 57*: Chapter 57</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: This one short, IDK, still kind of
depressed so this chapter seems real emotional, but its leading to
something I really want to cover so I guess it works. You know the
drill Read, Review, Enjoy!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN HARRY POTTER!</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty seven</p><p class="calibre7">"she smells." James complained as
he followed Ginny up the stairs, Lily in her arms.</p><p class="calibre7">"She does not." Ginny countered.
"Now would you like to help me?" she asked as she began opening
the door to the nursery.</p><p class="calibre7">"I suppose." James sighed
dramatically before running to get a new diaper.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled to herself, no matter how
reckless and troublesome James could be, she could always count on
him to help.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here Mummy." James said as he
reached the diaper up towards the changing table where Lily was.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you very much James." she
jumped slightly as the clock in the hall chimed. "Oh dear, James
can you run down stairs and ask Daddy to turn off the roast."</p><p class="calibre7">James slumped his shoulders. "All the
way downstairs" he exaggerated. "I guess, if you really want me
to." he smiled before taking off for the stair case.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled to herself as she listened
to James yell to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Lily don't you do it." Harry said
sternly. He sighed in frustration as the small girl continued to lift
the small object towards her mouth.</p><p class="calibre7">"Lily," Harry drawled as he took
the object, wiping the spit off of it. "James." he called loudly
up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes?" James called, followed by
the thunder of footsteps on the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Missing something?" Harry asked
holding up the object of examination.</p><p class="calibre7">"My king!" James yelled running
towards his Dad. "I've been looking for it for ages!"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed. "James what have we
told you about keeping your things up?"</p><p class="calibre7">James sighed. "That if I don't Lily
could swallow them." he repeated mundanely.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded his head. "Exactly, now
go and put this up. Where it belongs." he added.</p><p class="calibre7">James dropped his head dramatically as
he made his way up the stairs. He paused just before he disappeared
into the hall. "Dad," he called, making Harry look up the stairs.
"Will you play a game with me?" He added unsure as he rolled the
small king in his hands.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled. "I'd love to James."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">September 2009</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you packing for?" James
asked as he plopped down on Teddy's bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hogwarts." Teddy said simply as he
folded another shirt and set it carefully in his trunk.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your going?" James asked,
outraged. "I want to go!"</p><p class="calibre7">"James, your not old enough." Teddy
reasoned, closing the lid on his trunk and moving to sit on top of
it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Am too." James pouted.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy sighed loudly as he stood and
made his way into the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">"I am too," James yelled loudly
from behind him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Am too what?" Harry asked as Teddy
and James made their way into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uncle Harry, tell James he's not old
enough to go to Hogwart's."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed a bit and looked over to
Ginny who was smiling serenely with Lily on her lap.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well James you have to be Eleven to
go, and well son your just now five." Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I don't care. I want to go."</p><p class="calibre7">"Go where? Where are we going?"
Albus asked as he toddled into the room.</p><p class="calibre7">James turned to him. "Your not going
anywhere, Me and Teddy, were going to Hogwarts." He said sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I want to go to Hogwarts too!"
Albus cried and Harry and Ginny burst out laughing.</p><p class="calibre7">James turned to them and shot them a
mean look. "I am going." he said sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wipe that look off your face this
instant." Ginny said seriously. "And yes your are going-In six
years." She said resolutely.</p><p class="calibre7">James crossed his arms and stomped his
foot. "Not fair. Teddy gets to do everything."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah,"
Albus said coming up next to James and mimicking his pose.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah!"
Lily called from Ginny's lap as she hit her fist on the table,
causing the tension to break and everyone burst into laughter.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">January 2012</p><p class="calibre7">"Whats that?" James asked one night
at dinner.</p><p class="calibre7">"Whats what?" Harry asked as he
pulled the hand that had been retrieving a biscuit back to his plate.</p><p class="calibre7">"On your hand. How'd you get the scar
on your hand."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed as he set his fork down.
He looked across the table to Ginny. They had discussed what to do in
this situation before, but now that it was in front of him, he wasn't
sure he wanted James to know the past just yet.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked cautiously at Ginny once more
before turning to James. "Later."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Teddy," James asked as he dragged
his feet in the sand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes?" Teddy asked slowing the
swing he was on to a stop.</p><p class="calibre7">"What happened to my Dad when he was
younger?" James asked seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy stopped and looked over at the
younger boy, James was rarely serious but when he was it was usually
about and important subject.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know exactly," Teddy said
trying to gather his thoughts. "I know there was a big war when
they were younger, Thats how my parents died." he ended quietly.</p><p class="calibre7">James stayed silent, he knew Teddy's
parents were dead of course, that was why he lived with Aunt
Andromeda and well to be perfectly honest at their house the majority
of the time.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sorry," James whispered
quietly.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy shook his head softly. "Ive
heard a bit, from my Grandmum. She says your Dad died too, but I
don't understand how thats possible, with him being here and all."
he said, a confused look masking his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you miss them?" James asked, he
though that it was a stupid question but that it seemed right at the
present time.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy nodded a bit. "I never really
met them, I was only a few months when they died, so...I don't know.
Your Dad has told me loads about my Dad. Like did you know he was a
werewolf?" He asked excitedly.</p><p class="calibre7">James shook his head and Teddy
continued. "Yeah, he was one of your Dad's Father's friends, at
Hogwarts." He said softly looking out at the meadow.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in silence for a moment. "I'm
going inside James." Teddy said softly.</p><p class="calibre7">James nodded as Teddy stood from his
seat. "Bye Teddy."</p>
