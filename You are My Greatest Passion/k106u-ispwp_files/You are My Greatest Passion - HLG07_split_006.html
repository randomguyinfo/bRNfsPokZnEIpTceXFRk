<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_7">*Chapter 6*: Chapter 6</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter Six*</strong></p><p class="calibre7">The trip to Flourish and Blotts the next morning proved to be more difficult than Harry had initially thought.</p><p class="calibre7">The first problem he encountered was that they didn't have a specific sections for the books he was searching for, and the second was the fact that a photographer for the Daily Prophet was waiting just outside the store, and as normal as it may seem for someone his age to be buying a book on sex, he still didn't want it on the front page of the paper.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry finally gathered his courage and asked one of the sales Witches, in a low whisper of course, where he could find what he was looking for.</p><p class="calibre7">She led him to a section he could have sworn he had checked and pointed to the bottom row. Harry quickly sorted through the books and grabbed the two that looked like they would be most helpful. He quickly paid for the books, and the sale Witch was even nice enough to double wrap them, and headed out towards Gringotts. He had decided earlier in the day, that since he was already in Diagon Alley, he would go to his vault and see what was in the mystery box.</p><p class="calibre7">When he arrived at the bank he handed the Goblin his key and was quickly lead to his vault.</p><p class="calibre7">He sifted through the piles of items for an hour before locating the small wooden box. He opened the lid and inside saw two green velvet boxes and a sealed letter, on the front of which said <em class="calibre9">For Harry</em>.</p><p class="calibre7">He broke the seal and stared down at the parchment, he could recognize the writing from the letter he had found in Sirius's room the previous year, and knew it was from his mother.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">My Dearest Harry, October 22, 1981</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Hopefully this is finding you in safe and joyful times. We have hopes that in the near future that Voldemort will be defeated, but you never know which way the tide will turn. Thus, we have decided to write you this letter to let you know just how much we love you. You are our everything and our only hopes are that you will be able to grow up in a free world, where it does not matter if you are pureblood or not. In this box we have included our wedding bands, and my engagement ring, in hopes that when you find the one that completes you the way your father completes me, that you will bestow it upon her. We can only hope that we will be there when that happens. </em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Well love we must go, were meeting with the Order today to discuss what to do next. </em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Your Loving Mother,</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Lily</em></p><p class="calibre7">Harry felt tears welling up behind his eyes, the letter was simple and short, but it meant so much to him. He reached forward and opened one of the boxes, in it was what he assumed was his father's wedding band. It was simple, just a plain gold band, but there was something about. Something special that he could not quite put his finger on.</p><p class="calibre7">He closed the box and picked up the other one. He hesitated to open this one. He wasn't sure if he'd be able to take seeing his mothers ring, but finally decided that he needed to.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly opened the box, inside it were two rings one that looked like his father's but thinner, and the other a radiant Emerald with a single small Diamond on either side, set on a thin gold band. The moment he set his eyes on it he knew it would be perfect forâ€¦</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny." He breathed quietly. <em class="calibre9">Where did that come from?</em> He knew he had feelings for Ginny, but was it that deep. He had almost told her the other night that he loved her, but now it was really sinking in. He loved Ginny, more than anything else in the world.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled to himself. He placed the boxes and letter back in the wooden box and carried it out of the vault. He was feeling great after the realization that he loved Ginny. He even smiled for the photographer who had moved to wait outside of Gringotts.</p><p class="calibre7">As he was on his way back to the Leaky Cauldron to apparate to the Burrow he passed a vendor selling flowers. He bought a single red rose and didn't even worry when the photographer snapped another picture. When he inquired who the flower was for Harry just smiled to himself and headed off.</p><p class="calibre7">When he arrived in the back yard the wonderful scent of whatever Mrs. Weasley was cooking drifted towards him. He breathed deeply, taking it all in before heading towards the back door. When he entered, Mrs. Weasley was in her usual spot stirring a giant pot of soup, He could smell fresh bread in the oven.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ahh, there you are Harry. It'll be done any minute." She smiled sweetly at him.</p><p class="calibre7">Suddenly there were loud rushed footsteps on the stairs and a few seconds later Ginny appeared, she leaned against the wall and tried to act as if she was there the entire time.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh your back?" She asked nonchalantly. Harry had to bite back his laughter when Ron entered the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah and it's not like you've been sulking around here all day." He said raising his hands to make air quotes <em class="calibre9">'When is Harry getting back? When is Harry getting back?'.</em></p><p class="calibre7">Harry just smiled as Ron pranced around the kitchen mimicking Ginny. Ginny looked down bashfully and her face turned a deep blush.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry walked over to where she still stood on the stairs, he gave her a quick kiss before whispering into her ear.</p><p class="calibre7">"I've thought about you all day too." He said handing her the rose "This reminded me of you."</p><p class="calibre7">She just smiled before giving him a crushing hug.</p><p class="calibre7">"Dinners done." Molly called from the stove.</p><p class="calibre7">"Finally." Ron muttered under his breath as he took his seat at the table.</p><p class="calibre7">Later on that evening Harry laid in his bed reading one of the books he had purchased in Diagon Alley. The information he found, made him extremely grateful that he had not sat through the conversation with Mr. Weasley. He did not want his girlfriend's Dad thinking he would try that kind of stuff on his daughter.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry was contemplating whether or not Ginny would ever do any of those things when she walked in the room unannounced. He quickly shoved the book under his pillow and hoped she had not seen it.</p><p class="calibre7">"So did you get everything done today?" She asked as she wandered over to the dresser where he had sat the wooden box from his vault. "Is this the box on the Gringotts list?" Harry nodded, and then laughed when she tried to open it. <em class="calibre9">Thank goodness I thought ahead and put every locking spell I knew on it earlier.</em></p><p class="calibre7">She looked over at him. "What's in it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"It's a surprise." He chuckled.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny strode over to where he was lying on the bed. She swung one leg on to each side of him so that she was sitting on top of him. She leaned down and whispered very softly "Come on, tell me what's in there." She had a sly smile on her face.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry thought his heart would burst through his chest. Ginny was sitting on him, parts of her touching parts of him. Just the thought of it sent shivers through his body.</p><p class="calibre7">What happened next he couldn't help.</p><p class="calibre7">He tried to hide it but she must have already felt because she just smiled down at him. She ran her hands through his hair, messing it up even further. She bent down and gave him a gentle kiss, she was about to pull back up when Harry placed his hand on the back of her neck and held her there. He tangled one of his hands in her hair and placed the other on her hip. He ran his tongue along her bottom lip roughly.</p><p class="calibre7">She separated her lips and tilted her head to the side to allow him more room. He began exploring Ginny's mouth, everything about it was wonderful. The way she tasted, the way her tongue felt against his and especially the little noises she made as they kissed. He pulled her even closer to him and she began to wiggle against him.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Maybe she would be up for a few of the things in the book.</em></p><p class="calibre7">He rolled them over so that Ginny was beneath him and was just about to test his theory when Ron came into the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey mateâ€¦GET OFF MY SISTER!" Ron yelled as loud as he could before running over to them a pushing Harry off Ginny and into the wall the bed was against.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny propped herself up on her elbows and glowered at Ron. "Ronald if do not get out of here within the next few seconds I am going to hex you into next century."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just looked at the two siblings, he didn't know what to. He wished he could just disappear.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm not going anywhere, you're the one who needs to leave." He said sternly to Ginny. "I have something very important to talk to Harry about." His voice took on a serious tone.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at Harry for what to do. He glanced back at Ron whose eyes were pleading and then gave Ginny a small kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'll see you in the morning." She seemed kind of upset but headed down the hall for her own room.</p><p class="calibre7">He noticed that as she walked out she swung her hips a little more than usual, which made his decision to talk to Ron all the more difficult.</p><p class="calibre7">After she had made her exit, Harry finally turned to Ron. "This had better be important. And why the hell did you push me so hard for? That really hurt."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well you were basically shagging my sister!" Ron bellowed. "And it is important." He looked at Harry somewhat undignified.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat up on the edge of the bed. "I'm sorry, what is it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I need help in picking out a gift for Hermione." Ron stated seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry was furious "That's what you interrupted us for? So I can help you pick out a gift?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron just nodded. Harry would not believe it; He really could not believe that his best mate was that dense.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron must have been able to tell Harry was getting angry because he quickly added,</p><p class="calibre7">"And beside, you and Ginny were getting a little too chummy. Best mate or not, I don't want you doing that stuff with my sister."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry couldn't believe his ears, <em class="calibre9">wasn't it Ron earlier in the summer that pushed me to fix things with Ginny? And now he has a problem with it?</em></p><p class="calibre7">"What are you getting at? I thought you had no problem with me and Ginny being together?" He finally voiced his concerns.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't, I just don't want you to be together in THAT sense." Ron said in such a resolute tone that Harry could tell that Ron thought he was in the right. Harry decided that he could not deal with this presently. He was quickly becoming upset about how much of a git Ron was being and his head was still swimming with thoughts of Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, I can't deal with this right now. I'll talk to you in the morning, Then we'll go and find Hermione something." Without another word her rolled over to signal that the conversation was over. He heard Ron slowly get up and walk out of the room.</p><p class="calibre7">The next morning Harry woke up to the sounds of fighting down stairs. As he dressed and headed downstairs he could hear Molly feverishly trying to gain control on her two youngest children.</p><p class="calibre7">He didn't know how long Ginny and Ron had been going at it but as he entered the kitchen he could see that Ron was sporting a black eye.</p><p class="calibre7">"RONALD! GINEVRA! IF YOU TO DO NOT STOP THIS, I'LL BE IT!" Mrs. Weasley bellowed with no consequence. When she saw Harry, she gave him a pleading look. Harry quickly understood. He rushed over to where Ginny was and gathered her up in his arms just as she was going to lunge at Ron again. He pulled her into the sitting room.</p><p class="calibre7">"What the hell was that all about?" Harry asked sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">"He called me a slag."</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Harry said outraged, he was about to go in there a punch Ron himself.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, He accused me of shagging you and called me a slag."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry slowly sat on the couch and put his face in his hands. <em class="calibre9">Am I really causing that much trouble between them?</em></p><p class="calibre7">He looked up as he heard the door open and a very cross-looking Ron followed Mrs. Weasley into the room.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked at Ron and Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sit." She said sternly. She turned to Ron. "I will not have you calling your sister such distasteful names." She turned to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"And just to clarify, have you and Harry, umâ€¦" She fumbled with her fingers and Harry looked up mortified.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny just looked appalled. "Of course we haven't. Who do you think I am?" She asked outraged.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry could have sworn he heard Mrs. Weasley breath a sigh of relief.</p><p class="calibre7">"I want you both to apologize, Ron for calling your sister such a name, and Ginny even though he deserved it, you shouldn't have hit him so hard." She waited for them to mumble their apologies before heading back into the kitchen to finish breakfast.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat there in silence for a few minutes before Ron spoke up.</p><p class="calibre7">"So are we going into town to get something for Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked at him shocked. He still expected him to go into town with him. He was about tell Ron where he could stuff it when Ginny looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you mind if I join you?" Harry looked down at her, he nodded silently and after breakfast they set off for Ottery St. Catchpole.</p><p class="calibre7">That night Molly made a large dinner, the entire family joined them, except Charlie who was unable to get away, and Percy who was still working long hours to rebuild the Ministry. Andromeda even stopped by with Teddy.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry watched as Ginny sat on the floor playing with his godson. It pained him how much Teddy looked like Tonks and Remus, and he had to turn away. Ron and Bill were deeply emerged in a game of wizard chess, Bill was the only person who had ever came close to beating Ron, and he was determined to be triumphant.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly, Andromeda and Fleur were in the kitchen putting the finishing touches on things. While George and Arthur were discussing some of the latest products George had come up with when the doorbell rang. This caused everyone to look up.</p><p class="calibre7">First of all most people just walked into the Burrow and secondly no one very used the front door. Finally the anxious feeling to see who it was overwhelmed Arthur and he got up to answer it. When he answered the door, his eyes went wide and he leaned in for a hug. "You made it." Harry couldn't see who it was from where he was sitting he leaned back in his chair to get a better view. As he caught view of the visitors he felt himself start to lose balance, he wobbled for a second before the chair fell backwards and he smacked into the hard floor. There was laughter all around him before a familiar hand reached out to him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks Percy."</p><p class="calibre7">Later on that evening they all sat around the garden table idly chatting, when Percy stood up and tapped his wand on his glass signaling that he wanted everyone's attention. As soon as everyone had quieted down, he cleared his throat.</p><p class="calibre7">"I just thought I should in for you all that I have asked Audrey to marry me and she has graciously accepted." He sat down quickly while everyone just stared at Percy and Audrey dumbfounded.</p><p class="calibre7">It was Mrs. Weasley who finally broke the silence with a loud sob. She stood up and gathered the couple in her arms.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh dears. I am so excited for both of you. Now have you decided on a date?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron rolled his eyes "Here she goes again."</p><p class="calibre7">The next day was spent packing and running around gathering last minute items before they had to head to King's Cross the next day.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum! Mum! Have you seen my jumper? The green one." Harry heard Ginny yelling through the house. He laughed to himself, he remembered the first time he had been at the Burrow and Ginny was running around frantically looking for a lost jumper. It seemed like so long ago, they all were so young. He finished packing his truck reminiscing in memories of years past.</p><p class="calibre7">That afternoon the sky began to darken earlier than usual and a dense heat settled over the Burrow. Even with the windows open and a few cooling charms the air was still stifling and Harry's shirt clung to his body.</p><p class="calibre7">Finally around midnight the storm broke, rain pelted loudly against the side of the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre7">A bolt of lightning struck and lit up his entire room. He heard the scurrying of feet on the landing outside his door and looked up to see Ginny in his doorway wearing her dressing gown. She walked over to the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry can I sleep with you?"</p><p class="calibre7">He looked up at her confused "What?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Can I sleep in here with you?" She clarified "It's a lot cooler in here and, and well I don't want to be alone."</p><p class="calibre7">He looked at her; he could see in her eyes that she was serious.</p><p class="calibre7">"Won't we get in trouble if you Mum finds us?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I promise I'll be gone before she even wakes." She paused for a moment.</p><p class="calibre7">"Besides it's not like we're going to do anything." Harry looked at her disappointed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Harry, it's too hot and I really am tired."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry starred at her for a few more moments before her pulled down the sheet he was sleeping under and scooted over to make room for her. She slid in next to him, her body was warm, but a different warmth that the one produced by the storm, and he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry awoke the next morning to Ginny softly pushing on his arm.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, Harry wake up. Mum will be up in a little bit."</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly opened his eyes to her blurry figure. He reached out for his glasses and put them on. He saw Ginny lying next to him, still in her nightgown. He was suddenly very worried.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny you've got to get out of here...if anyone finds us." He stammered.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know but you've got your arms wrapped around me and I can't get out." Her voice was strained as she wiggled in his grip.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh sorry." Harry blushed as he let go of her and she got up from the bed. She leaned down a placed a soft kiss on his lips before she silently snuck back to her room.</p>
