<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_11">*Chapter 10*: Chapter 10</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Another short one before i head out to finish my christmas shopping, ive been putting it off because the holiday season is so depressing when your hubby is deployed, take my word for it, but it is my daughters 1st christmas, so it should be interesting. You should so review. I mean come on it is the season of giving right? lol. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Same Disclaimer, i dont own, blah.</strong></p><p class="calibre7">The next few days were enjoyable. Ron really did make an effort to be cordial to Harry and Ginny, but he couldn't help himself from making disgusted faces whenever they kissed in front of him. Ginny found it amusing, and after awhile Harry did too. They began sharing small kisses whenever Ron was around just to irritate him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Would you two stop that, I'm trying to eat here." Ron announced one day at breakfast. He and Harry had been there from sometime and Ginny had just entered the hall. Harry had routinely placed a small kiss on her cheek as she sat down. Harry just laughed and began to place small kisses all over Ginny's face. Ron just stared in disgust. "Ok, ok I give. Can you just take it down a notch?" they laughed as Harry resumed eating and Ginny began to pile her plate.</p><p class="calibre7">"Did you see the notice on the board in the common room?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"No Hogsmead 'till winter. Yeah I already owled Hermione to tell her"' Ron said through a mouth full of food.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron that's disgusting" Ginny said appalled.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you talking about?" Ron replied as he shoved another forkful in.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry did all he could to keep from laughing. "Come on gin, lets head to class" he grabbed Ginny hand and lead her out of the hall with Ron yelling from behind "what?"</p><p class="calibre7">A few hours later Harry found himself walking Ginny to her Muggle Studies class. They stopped outside of the classroom door and Harry began to place small kisses on her face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry stop it" Ginny giggled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Never!" harry yelled as he began to kiss her faster.</p><p class="calibre7">They heard footsteps as Romilda and a small group of sixth years walked past.</p><p class="calibre7">"Isn't that disgusting" Romilda said with a snarl.</p><p class="calibre7">"But I thought you liked Harry?" one of the girls asked softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I do, but I can't stand to see him with that slag" she said the last words a bit louder so that Ginny could hear as they walked by.</p><p class="calibre7">One look at Ginny's face told Harry that this wasn't the first time something like this had happened. He quickly turned around.</p><p class="calibre7">"What was that Romilda?" he asked with a faked curiosity.</p><p class="calibre7">"Um well, uh…nothing Harry" Romilda stumbled through her word.</p><p class="calibre7">"That's what I thought" he turned back to Ginny and gave her a small smile. "I have to head to class. If you have any other problems let me know" he lifted up her chin "okay?" she nodded her head and he gave her a soft kiss before he quickly headed down the hall towards his defense against the dark arts class.</p><p class="calibre7">Romilda gave a small 'humfp' as she stomped her foot, Ginny looked over at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know what he sees in you Weasley, he could do so much better." she shook her hair back and all the other girls nodded on agreement. "You must be a pretty good shag for him to keep you around, I don't see any other reason why he would" and with a small smirk Romilda turned on her heel and headed down the hall towards her next class.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny waited until they were out of sight before she let herself breakdown. She slid down the wall and rested her head in her hands. She didn't understand why they kept saying those things to her, she knew they were just jealous but it hurt just the same, and she couldn't help but wonder if the whole school had the same idea, that Harry was only with her because they were 'supposedly' sleeping together. She looked up to the sound of footsteps coming down the hall, and silently prayed it was Romilda coming back to torment her some more.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny what's wrong?" Ron asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's nothing Ron." she said as she wiped the tears from her face.</p><p class="calibre7">"It doesn't look like nothing. Come on tell me what's wrong." He said as he took a seat on the floor next to her.</p><p class="calibre7">"It just…well…you see" she paused trying to figure out how to word it so Ron would understand. "Harry has..."</p><p class="calibre7">"Has he done something to hurt you" he interrupted. "Cause best mate or not, if he hurt you I'll kill him"</p><p class="calibre7">"No its not harry, I'm mean it has to do with him, but it's not his fault."</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm still not catching on Ginny"</p><p class="calibre7">She gave a sigh before continuing, "It's just people, especially Romilda Vane, keep asking me what I did to trick him into dating me. There saying the only reason he's with me is because I'm shagging him." she let out a deep breath, it felt surprisingly good to tell someone how she was feeling.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, um are you two, uh <em class="calibre9">shagging</em>?" he twisted his face in disgust at the last word.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at the disgusted look on her brother's face and smiled. "No Ron were not shagging."</p><p class="calibre7">He let out a breath of air. "Good. Well then what does it matter what they say? You know it's not true and so does Harry. There just jealous." Ron wrapped an arm around her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know but it still hurts."</p><p class="calibre7">"I know, but there's nothing you can do about it except ignore them. Don't let them see you upset, sooner or later they'll stop."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked up at Ron and smirked. "Wow Ron I didn't know you could be so deep."</p><p class="calibre7">"Smartass" he said as he swatted the back of her head. He stood up and dusted off his trousers, he offered his hand down to her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on gin let's get to class." she took his hand and headed into the classroom.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre4">Meanwhile</strong></em></p><p class="calibre7">Harry ran into the DADA classroom just as the bell rang. Auror Williamson sat at the desk in his usual position.</p><p class="calibre7">"Beginning to make a routine out of that aren't we?" he asked with a smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sorry professor. It's just that my girlfriends class is on the other side of the castle and…" Williamson raised his hand to cut Harry off. "I understand completely. Now since this class is also counting for Auror credits, I thought we would take today and go over some of the basic spells that we use every day in the line of duty. Okay?"</p><p class="calibre7">"That sounds great" Harry was actually quite excited about this, it'd be awesome to learn something new, as he was beginning to become bored with his regular DADA classes. "what's first?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Eager aren't we?" Williamson asked with a chuckle. "Well I thought we'd start with a simple stunning spell."</p><p class="calibre7">"But sir I already know the stunning spell."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes you know the basic one, but this one is a bit stronger. Watch."</p><p class="calibre7">He moved his hand and quietly muttered "Stupefactus" a bright yellow light flew out of his wand and stuck the dummy on the other side of the room. As the dummy flew across the room Harry took everything in, it really was stronger than the basic Stupefy. Williamson looked down at Harry and smiled "what do you think?'</p><p class="calibre7">"I think it's bloody excellent," he said a little more eagerly than he had meant to. "Can I try?'</p><p class="calibre7">Williamson used his wand to right the dummy and stood back. "Let's see what you've got."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry carefully mimicked the hand movement he had seen Williamson demonstrate. He muttered the incantation and when the yellow light flew across the room and struck the dummy, he was very pleased with himself.</p><p class="calibre7">"Excellent m'boy! I didn't expect you to get it so soon, that means we can move on. Ok let's try this one.' he again righted the dummy before striking it with another spell. "Evinxi" chains rose up and all around the dummy. "This is what you would use to tie up a particularly difficult suspect." he smiled at Harry "care to give it a go?"</p><p class="calibre7">When the bell rang for the next class Harry could barely hide his excitement he had learned five new spells including one hell of a shield charm. He was so excited that when he saw Ginny, he couldn't help himself he gathered her up in his arms and kissed her deeply. He ignored the catcalls and whistles around them, and lost himself in her. When he finally released her she looked back at him dreamily, her eyes still half closed.</p><p class="calibre7">"What was that for?" she asked after a few moments.</p><p class="calibre7">"What I can't kiss the girl I love whenever I want?" he asked while pretending to pout. Ginny just laughed at him and pulled in him into a close hug.</p><p class="calibre7">"I have no problem with it, it was just a bit…unexpected." she let out a small chuckle. "What happened?'</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing" he tried in vain to act nonchalant "just started some of my Auror training." at the last word he could not help it; his face involuntarily went into a full-blown smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh' Ginny cried out. "I'm so excited for you!" she squeezed him close once again before Auror Williamson called for class to start.</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: So what's ya think, huh? lol.</strong></p>
