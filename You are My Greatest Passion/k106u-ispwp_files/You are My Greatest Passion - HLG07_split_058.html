<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_59">*Chapter 58*: Chapter 58</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Hey sorry about the brief period
between chapters, anyone who has every spun/heard of winterguard
knows this is the fierce part of the season. FFCC held championships
this past weekend and my girls walked away with first! Hahahaha!! I'm
so proud. But anyway, enjoy your chapter and review please! Lol</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: I DONT OWN HARRY POTTER,
BUT I TEACH A 1ST PLACE GUARD!!!!!!!!</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty Eight-2012</p><p class="calibre7">"James," Harry said softly as he
stood in the doorway of the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre7">James looked up wearily from the book
he had been pursuing. "Yes Dad?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed and walked over to sit on
the edge of the bed. "I've been thinking about what you asked me
the other day." he said, fiddling with his hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"About your hand?" James asked
sitting up a bit more. Harry nodded, "It's just, Well James I don't
know how to tell you everything and frankly I still think your too
young to know it all." He said turning to look at James who nodded
in understanding. "What do you already know?" Harry asked lamely.</p><p class="calibre7">James took a deep breath. "Well Teddy
said there was a big war, and well thats how his parents died, but
that's about it." James blushed a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, well yes there was a war and
yes that's how Teddy's parents died. And a lot of other people too."
He looked down to his hands again. "Did you know your uncle George
was a twin?" He asked looking to James once again.</p><p class="calibre7">James shook his head, "I've seen
pictures, with them, but now one ever explained it to me." he said
quietly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded. "Fred." he said
quietly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Like my cousin?" James asked
confused and Harry produced a small smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"No like your uncle," he laughed.
"The second half of Weasley Wizading Wheeze's" He laughed, "They
caused so much trouble for your Grandmum when they were younger, and
most people never expected them to succeed to anything." He laughed
again. "But anyway," Harry sighed, trying to get back on subject.
"The war affected a lot of people, and Me and your Mum's family
were in the very center of it."</p><p class="calibre7">"Actually your Mum wasn't supposed to
be there, she snuck there. Never would have forgiven her if something
would have happened." He mumbled and James looked at him silently.</p><p class="calibre7">"The point is, there is a lot to
understand about it and I just don't know how to tell it all."
Harry said turning to face James completely. "Maybe in a few years
or so, when your just a bit older. Okay?" he asked pleadingly.</p><p class="calibre7">James nodded, "I can deal with that."
he smiled and Harry made for the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"But Dad?" James asked, causing
Harry to turning from his place by the door. "Will you at least
tell me what happened to your hand."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled, "Yeah, I guess I can do
that." He smiled as he lay next to James in the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">They spent the night, Harry retailing
the story of Umbridge and her rein of terror over Hogwarts, and James
laughing at the antics of his uncles; and Harry and Hermione leading
Umbridge to the centaurs.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Summer 2013</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
and James stood on the back porch watching Teddy fly on his new
broom.</p><p class="calibre7">"James
don't you even think about it." Harry said sternly as Teddy flew
and James eyes grew wide.</p><p class="calibre7">"But
why not Dad?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Because
I said so that's why."</p><p class="calibre7">"It
not fair," he pouted, "Teddy got to do it."</p><p class="calibre7">"And
teddy is older than you."</p><p class="calibre7">James
stopped his foot. "Not fair."</p><p class="calibre7">"And
that attitude is exactly why you aren't old enough to try it."
Harry reasoned as he walked back into the house.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
walked into the living room later that afternoon.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny
have you seen James?" he asked looking around.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah,
he was heading outside, said something about practicing." She said,
not looking up from her magazine.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh
noâ€¦" Harry said as he headed towards the back door.</p><p class="calibre7">"What
is it Harry?" Ginny asked from behind him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
turned to face her. "your son," he said pointing at Ginny, "got
upset this morning when I showed Teddy the Wronski Feint and wouldn't
let him try." Ginny's eyes grew wide as she pushed Harry aside
and ran for the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Daddy
said not to try it." Albus reminded James for the fifth time.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah,
well Dad isn't here is he?" James said smugly as he mounted his
broom.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your
going to get hurt."</p><p class="calibre7">"No
I'm not. Stop being a baby Al." he said before he flew off to the
sky. <em class="calibre9">Al, always trying to ruin my fun.</em></p><p class="calibre7">He
looked at the ground and waved at Albus. He made a few lazing
circles,"Okay, I'm gonna do it now!" he yelled to the ground
before he turned his broom forward and flew full speed towards the
ground.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay,
I'm gonna do it now!" was the first thing Ginny heard as she
stepped into the back yard. The second was a Woo-Who from her oldest
son. And the Third was the smack as he hit the ground.</p><p class="calibre7">She
ran as fast as she could over to James, but Harry's longer legs
ensured he made it there first.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ouch,"
James cried as he held his arm. "It hurts."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
looked at his son angrily, but pushed it aside as he took his sons
arm.</p><p class="calibre7">"I
think its broken Gin. Well have to take him to St. Mungos."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
nodded. "Al, will you go tell Lily to get ready?" she asked
looking at James arm, bent at a weird angle.</p><p class="calibre7">Albus
quickly ran off and met them in the livingroom a few minutes later,
Lily in tow.</p><p class="calibre7">"James
is in trouble, James is in trouble." She sang as she danced around
Harry, who held James in his arms.</p><p class="calibre7">"No
I'm not." James defended as he stuck out his tongue at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh
yes you are." Harry said, stopping the banter. "I specifically
told you not to do that. But did you listen? No, you did it anyway,
and look where it's gotten you." He finished as the flames grew
green and he stepped through them into the waiting room of St.
Mungos.</p><p class="calibre7">They
made their way up to the receptionist.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah
hello Harry. James." She smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Afternoon
Florence." James smiled sweetly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What
did you do this time?" she asked looking at his arm.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why
nothing. What would make you think that I, sweet innocent James would
do something."</p><p class="calibre7">"Quidditch."
Harry interrupted as Ginny signed them in.</p><p class="calibre7">Florence
nodded, "You know the way." She sighed as they walked towards the
hall. "Bye James."</p><p class="calibre7">He
smiled sweetly and waved with his good hand as they disappeared down
the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"You
know he gets it from you." harry reasoned the next day.</p><p class="calibre7">"Me?"
Ginny asked affronted. "What makes you think he gets it from me?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well,"
Harry paused to pull his shirt over his head. "You never really
listened to your parents, and your broke your arm more than a few
time playing."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
huffed indignantly. "I seem to remember you never obeying orders
too. And, and...well you broke a bone almost every game back at
Hogwarts." she laughed at Harry outraged face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Most
of those weren't my fault! The one time was Quirrell, then dobby,
then the dementors..." trailed off looking smug.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
laughed, "Have an excuse for everything don't you?" she asked
climbing into the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">Laughed, "Usually." he laid down
next her under the sheet, and put his arms behind his head.</p><p class="calibre7">"did you ever think it'd be like
this? Back then?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed a bit and laid her head on
his chest. "I don't know, I mean, I thought we'd be together,
especially after fifth year," she laughed. "And then James was a
surprised, but a good one-most of the time." They laughed together.
"I like the way things turned out," Ginny finished, "Don't
you?" she asked looking up at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">He moved his arms down around her, "Of
course. I never dreamed I'd be here, But now that I've got it, I
wouldn't trade it for the world." he said as he squeezed Ginny
gently.</p><p class="calibre7">She smiled softly against his chest, "I
love you Harry" I love you too Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Lily, get off."Albus said pushing
the small girl slightly. "I'm trying to read." he said, holding
the book above her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"I want to read." Lily pouted,
crossing her arms.</p><p class="calibre7">"You can't your too little."</p><p class="calibre7">"She's bigger than you." James
laughed as he came into the room, idly munching on an apple.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shut up James." Albus said
throwing his book down.</p><p class="calibre7">"Aww did I hurt LITTLE Albus's
feeling?" James laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Albus huffed as he pushed his glasses
up his nose and stood from the chair.</p><p class="calibre7">James laughed out, "What are going to
do?"</p><p class="calibre7">Albus took a deep breath before
stepping over to where James was reclining in the side chair.</p><p class="calibre7">James looked up at him a laughed again.</p><p class="calibre7">Albus closed his eye and reared back
his fist.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum!" James cried as he ran threw
the house, holding his nose. "Mum!"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny poked her head out of
the office, "What now James? Oh my Gods!" she ran threw the</p><p class="calibre7">doorway to James. "What
happened?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Albus hit me!" James said
incredulously.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stifled a laugh as Al came around
the corner, Lly in tow.</p>
