<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_24">*Chapter 23*: Chapter 23</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N" Hey sorry bout the wait. im currently unpacking, so that got in the way. and well victoria's secret had a huge sale, spent 4 hours at the mall. lol. Okay hope you enjoy this one, its kinda smutty. Enjoy and review.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Cherry Coke= GOOD Assuming i own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny had barely made it into the kitchen when Harry came running down the stairs and gathered her in his arms. He began planting kisses all over her face and finally her lips. When he ran his tongue against her bottom lip, she pushed him away.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked at her with a hurt expression "What?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing." She drew out the word and motioned her head towards Mrs. Weasley, whom Harry had not even noticed in the kitchen. "Not here." Ginny mouthed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Harry nodded. "Here let me help you get your things unpacked." He added while picking up her bag.</p><p class="calibre7">They hurriedly made their way upstairs and into the sanctuary of Ginny's bedroom. Harry quickly locked the door before throwing Ginny's bag and turning back to her. "God I've missed you." He stated before latching his lips onto hers. He quickly backed her up and onto the bed before reaching up and pulling off his shirt. Ginny paused for a minute and looked at his chest, "Harry what happened?" she asked as she traced a faint outline of a scar on his ribs. She was used to seeing the other scars on his chest, the heart shaped one from the locket and the small one from where Voldemort tried to kill him for the second time, but this one was new to her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Stupid. Other. Trainee," he managed to get out as he attacked her lips again. "Didn't understand how to properly do a spell before he tried it." He told her as he lifted her shirt above her head. He sat back on his knees and looked down at her. "You really don't know how much I've missed you," She heard a low growl escape his lips, before he leaned down licking and sucking on her neck. He reached around and quickly undid the clasp of her bra before throwing it to the ground and moving a hand down to her newly exposed breast. He kissed down her breastbone before letting his tongue find its way to her nipple. He let it linger for a moment before sitting back up to undo his belt buckle.</p><p class="calibre7">"Trousers are way too uncomfortable at this point." He laughed and Ginny helped him push his pants down and off. He turned his attention to Ginny's jean shorts. He leaned down and kissed the skin above the button before undoing it and pulling the shorts off her. <em class="calibre9">Thank god, I wore cute knickers.</em> However, it did not matter for long, soon Harry had grabbed onto them and they joined the ever-growing pile of clothes. "Gods Gin," Harry said kissing the inside of her knee. "The past month and half has been dreadful without you." He kissed her inner thigh. "First Training, then I had to sit around and listen to Ron and Hermione, telling each other how much they love one another." Ginny laughed and he moved to her hipbone. "And when I would get them one on one, all they'd want to talk about was the other. Or worse-they'd want to discuss sex."He moved up to her breast again. "And all the while, they were talking about sexual positions and acts, I couldn't help it, you kept popping into my head in said positions." He finally gave her a small kiss on the lips. "I love you."</p><p class="calibre7">He sat back up and removed his boxer before lying on top of her. She wrapped her arms around his bare back as he sucked on her neck. She could feel him pressing his hips and <em class="calibre9">oh,</em> <em class="calibre9">other parts</em> against her, creating a friction that was quickly overwhelming her. She let out a low throaty moan; Causing Harry to quickly move to the side of her and move his hand slowly down her body. He began slowly pushing his finger in and out of her as he rubbed her with his thumb. He kissed slowly down her body and began sucking on her hipbone.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Gods I love this</em>, he thought of the way she felt around him, the small noises she made, and even the way she smelled. He vaguely wondered what it would taste like. He thought back to the books he had purchased in Diagon alley and thought about one of the chapters he had read, <em class="calibre9">I wonder if she'd let me. Would she like it? </em>He chanced a glance at where his hand was moving in and out of her. She let out another moan as if subconsciously telling him to go for it, <em class="calibre9">okay I can do this,</em> he thought as he moved his face between her legs, he slowly let out a breath causing Ginny to open her eyes just before he replaced his thumb with his mouth.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Oh my god what is he doing? </em>Ginny thought as she opened her eyes to look down at Harry, it had almost felt, as if he had blow cool air onto her. She looked down to see Harry's head positioned between her legs. <em class="calibre9">Oh, he is not. </em>He lowered his head. <em class="calibre9">Oh he is. O, goodness. </em>She repressed a scream of pleasure and Harry moved his finger quicker, in and out. <em class="calibre9">Oh my gods.</em> She thought as he sucked on her. She tangled her hands in his hair, she could feel the pressure building and knew if he kept this up, it'd be over soon. She bit her lip in hopes of prolonging the pleasure.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry moved his tongue in a circle again; she seemed to moan especially loud when he did that. He sucked on the small buddle with a renewed force. Soon she was panting and pulling his hair so hard, he was afraid she would rip it out. He sucked harder on the nub and raked his teeth against it. Ginny let out a low cry before releasing his hair and lying still on the bed. Harry slowly removed his fingers from her and looked down at her once again. He could not resist, He gave one last slow lick and Ginny shuddered a bit. He moved up to lie next to her, inconspicuously wiping his fingers on her bedspread.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Harry," Ginny said without opening her eyes. "That wasâ€¦" she trailed off.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you." Harry said smiling. "The book said you'd like it." He said under his breath</p><p class="calibre7">"Book?" Ginny asked peeking through one eye at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, yeah." He turned away, looking for something to steer the direction away from his slip up. "Oh, so how were auditions?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I'll tell you after you tell me about the book."</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Damn it.</em> "Okay," he sighed. "When we first got back together, your dad tried to give me and Ron 'the talk' but I couldn't sit through that, not with him. So I purchased some books in Diagon alley on the subject."</p><p class="calibre7">"On the subject?" Ginny laughed. "Harry you sound like Hermione!"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry blushed slightly. "Okay, make fun of me all you want, but you've got to admit, you enjoyed it."</p><p class="calibre7">"Wasn't saying I didn't." she smiled at him sweetly before getting off the bed to retrieve her clothing. Harry got up after her and did the same.</p><p class="calibre7">"So your turn. How did auditions go?" he asked slipping into his trousers.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smile to herself. "Oh they went okay I guess." She slipped on her shirt to help hide her smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sorry Gin," he slipped on his shirt and came over to wrap her in a hug.</p><p class="calibre7">"For what?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"That you didn't make it." Harry stated confused, He thought it'd be apparent.</p><p class="calibre7">"Who said I didn't make it?" Ginny smile brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"You made it?" Harry yelled lifting her up and spinning her around. Ginny nodded and Harry kissed her hard.</p><p class="calibre7">"Goodness, we need to tell your Mum. And Ron! He's going to be so jealous!" Harry said as he pulled her out of the room and down the stairs.</p>
