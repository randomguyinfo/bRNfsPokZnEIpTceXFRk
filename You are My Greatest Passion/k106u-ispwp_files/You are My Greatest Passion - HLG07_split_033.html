			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Sorry abou the lack in updating. Between trying to get the b-day list and timeline done, writting chapter 25, and preping my guard for their premier show this weekend. i didnt really find time to edit. So sorry about that. I'll try to updat eagain to tomorrow and if not then, most likly sunday. ENJOY AND REVIEW!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Hopefully getting top 10 at preimer=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p class="calibre7">"So where exactly were you wanting to look?" Harry asked a few nights later. They were sitting on the couch sharing a bowl of chocolate ice cream.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, just a few places." Ginny said licking her spoon. Harry starred as she trailed her tongue over the spoon. <em class="calibre9">Uh…maybe she will. </em>He could feel himself hardening,<em class="calibre9"> No wedding stuff, focus.</em> He shook his head.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well you have to tell me where to start."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well," Ginny began her cheeks turning a slight pink. "Your remember when you told me about Godric's Hollow?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up confused, but nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well you mentioned a church. Just by where your Parents are. I thought that would be nice." She blushed deeply as she looked down into the bowl.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," he started before clearing his throat. "That's the sweetest things I've ever heard." He smiled at her shyly. "Now I feel really terrible about fighting with you."</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't worry. You did not know. So can we check it out? I've never seen it." She was nearly bouncing on the couch.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, but it's a muggle church you know that right?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stopped bouncing. "Oh. Really?" she looked dishearten for a moment. "It's okay well work something out." She smiled big again. "I love you."</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too Ginny."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry woke Saturday morning well rested. He loved weekends.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly rolled over and wrapped his arms around Ginny, when he felt her stir he asked. "So what are we doing today?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, well I don't know about you but I," she pointed to herself, "have the first fitting for my wedding robes." She smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, okay." Harry said disappointed, he had really been hoping to spend the day with her. "Well I guess I'll just, hang out."</p><p class="calibre7">"You could go to Madame Malkin's and see if she can fit you in for your robes." Ginny suggested.</p><p class="calibre7">"You're not getting yours from her?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"No were going to the bridal shop at the far end of Diagon Alley."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, there is a bridal shop in Diagon alley?" Ginny nodded. "I never knew that."</p><p class="calibre7">He sat there for a moment longer. "Well if I'm going to see if she'll take me I better get going. Can you meet me for lunch?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. "I might have Hermione with me, but yeah."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay," he said slipping into his shoes. "Leaky Cauldron around one-ish?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Sounds great."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry kissed her cheek before heading out the door.</p><p class="calibre7">Fortunately, Madam Malkin had been able to fit Harry in fairly quickly and now he had a few hours to kill. He stood in Quality Qudditch supplies book and stationary section, looking for the new edition of the Harpies calendar. He was to give up when someone tapped him lightly on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">He turned to face Cho Chang.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, hello Cho." He said surprised.</p><p class="calibre7">She smiled brightly at him. "Hi Harry."</p><p class="calibre7">They stood silently for a minute.</p><p class="calibre7">"So what are you looking for?" she asked softly touching his upper arm.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked at the hand cautiously. "Oh, the new Harpies calendar."</p><p class="calibre7">"Would you like some help?" She asked, rubbing at his arm slightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, sure. I guess." As much as he did not want to talk to Cho t the present moment, he couldn't find it in himself to be rude to her either.</p><p class="calibre7">He continued to scan the shelves.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here it is," Cho spoke up after a moment, she carefully handed it to Harry. He thumbed though it and when he got to August he smiled. How lucky was it that his mother's engagement ring would match Ginny's Quidditch robes.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Harry," he was brought out of his train of thought. "How have you been? I haven't seen you since before last Christmas."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I've been great." He did not want to provide anything that would lead to a longer discussion.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really, if you didn't notice I didn't return after break." Harry nodded. "I went to France for a while and interned at their Ministry. I'm supposed to start in ours soon." She smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"That sounds great Cho." Harry said moving towards the register. <em class="calibre9">Maybe she will get the hint and leave.</em></p><p class="calibre7">He was however, not so lucky. Cho followed by his side as he exited the store and headed towards the leaky cauldron, babbling about what had happened since last Christmas.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh and Harry, have you been working out?" she asked clutching his upper arm again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, yeah Auror training and all."</p><p class="calibre7">She gasped. "You're an Auror. Oh wow, to get through the training that fast, you must be really good." She moved closer to him. "We'll have to get together for lunch when I start next month." She said excitedly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh Cho." Harry said as he tried to pull away. He had to find a way to get away from her. He looked at his watch. "I actually was on my way to the Leaky Cauldron to have lunch wit…"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Harry," she cut him off. "Id love to have lunch with you." She smiled big. <em class="calibre9">Uh oh Ginny is not going to like this.</em> "You know we never did get to go into Hogsmead together like we said we would."</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">When did we say that</em>? Harry wondered as he pushed the door open. He quickly scanned the room for Ginny's bright hair. When he found her, he was relieved to find her accompanied by Hermione. <em class="calibre9">Good maybe that will ease the blow.</em> He made his way to the table, Cho following close behind.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey," Ginny called brightly as she saw Harry, however when she saw Cho behind him her face quickly turned into a mask of anger.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey sweetie, darling, baby?" Harry said every pet name he could think of as he reached Ginny and gave her a small kiss. As he was pulling away, he whispered in her ear. "She won't stop following me."</p><p class="calibre7">He quickly took his seat next to Ginny, leaving Cho to pull up her own chair, as she looked on confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"You two are still together?" she asked upset.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded smugly.</p><p class="calibre7">"That's why I was looking for a Harpies calendar." He said as he pulled the item from his bag and flipped to August. "Look at Ginny." He said proudly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ugh," Ginny said as she lifted the calendar from the table. "I look terrible."</p><p class="calibre7">"I agree," Harry heard Cho mumble but chose not to acknowledge it.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Cho how have you been?" Hermione asked. <em class="calibre9">Always the diplomatic one,</em> Harry thought.</p><p class="calibre7">After they had ordered and after thoroughly awkward conversation the rest had been informed about Cho's past year.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Ginny," she said haughtily taking a sip of her drink. "What are you up to, besides dating Harry, for now?" She raised her eyebrows.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well Cho," Ginny drew out her name and Harry sat back further in his chair, <em class="calibre9">this could get dangerous. </em>"I have been busy playing Professional Quidditch. And you're right about me dating Harry for now." Cho face brightened just bit, "this time next year we won't be dating." Ginny smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh you won't, too bad." Cho said with a feigned sweetness.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh don't feel too bad."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh but I do, to break up after being together that long. A tragedy."</p><p class="calibre7">She looked at her with feigned shock; bring her hand to her chest. "But no one said we were breaking up," Ginny chuckled. "I just said we won't be dating."</p><p class="calibre7">Cho looked confused. She made to speak but Ginny cut her off. "Well be married." Ginny smiled brightly and presented her left hand.</p><p class="calibre7">Cho looked at the offered hand a bit confused and scared, as if the hand would bite. She swallowed deeply. "It's nice. I've, uh. I've got to go," she mumbled as she gathered her things and hastily made her way out of the tavern.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," Harry said, "I think you made her cry."</p><p class="calibre7">"Serves her right. Hitting on you. And assuming that we would set a date to break up? I mean who does that?" she asked before taking a sip from her drink.</p><p class="calibre7">"We'll either way she's gone so let's just try and have a good lunch." Hermione pleaded.</p>
