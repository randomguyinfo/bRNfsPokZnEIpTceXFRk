<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_42">*Chapter 41*: Chapter 41</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Wow so interesting days. My MS Word stopped working so i went to get a new copy. Did anyone know its like $150? what the hell? well lets just say im now working with openoffice and its taking awhile to get use to. ugh. oaky i hope you enjoy this. Read and Review!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: Losing 2 pounds(115 lbs now, hey!)=AWESOME Assuming I own Harry Potter= NOT SO AWESOME</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Forty-One</p><p class="calibre7">Harry waited in the back room of the church, pacing. <em class="calibre9">What was taking so long?</em></p><p class="calibre7">He looked up when the door creaked open and Ron walked in.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mate, their ready for you." Harry nodded and followed Ron slowly into the chapel.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked out at the crowd of family and friends gathered. The church looked, if possible, more amazing that it had the previous night. The Setting Sun shone in through the stained glass window reflection millions of colors across the tulle that covered the church.</p><p class="calibre7">He watched as several people waved, and shuddered when he saw Romilda in the crowd. <em class="calibre9">Who the hell let her in?</em> he was about to catch Ron's attention when he saw the person next to her wrap an arm over her shoulder. <em class="calibre9">Hmm who would have though Romilda Vane and Anthony Goldstein. </em>He continued scanning the crowd until the music started.</p><p class="calibre7">He watched as the flower girls made their way down the aisle sprinkling the petals delicately along the way. He smiled as Teddy began the trot down the aisle stopping every few steps to wave to someone he knew. When he reached the front and saw Andromeda he made his way over to her. "I'm in uncle Harry's wedding." He exclaimed loudly. "Aunt Ginny is pretty." He smiled big as Andromeda pulled him into her lap.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny took in a deep breath as Luna disappeared down the aisle with Neville, smiling dreamily.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Okay I can do this.</em> She told herself.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hermione" she whispered. "What if I trip?" she asked, petrified suddenly of taking a tumble.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione turned and gave Ginny and exasperated look, "Ginny you are not going to trip. You'll be fine." She peeked over her shoulder. "I've got to go, just calm down." She gave a fleeting smile as she rounded the corner and headed to the altar.</p><p class="calibre7">She took a deep breath as she slowly counted to ten.</p><p class="calibre7">"You ready dear?" Arthur asked as he hooked his arm in hers.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and gave her father a small smile. They took a step forward and rounded the corner into her new life.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sucked in a deep breath as Ginny appeared at the edge of the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Breathing mate, its vital." Ron laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shut up," Harry whispered back fiercely, not taking his eyes off of Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny slowly made her way to the alter, feeling as if without her fathers support she would collapse at any moment.</p><p class="calibre7">When they reached the alter the Minister mumbled something and Ginny felt her father pulling away, she wanted to scream <em class="calibre9">no I'll fall</em>, but soon a pair of familiar hands grasped hers and she felt safe again. She looked up into Harry's eyes and smiled brighter than she had at all that day.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry began to worry as Arthur stepped away, Ginny's expression was terrified and he was scared of what she might do. He quickly reached out to grab her and keep her from running. When she turned her face up to smile at him, and all was right in the world.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9"><br class="calibre6"/></em>In the name of God, I Harry James Potter…</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">In the name of God, I Ginevra Molly Weasley </em></p><p class="calibre7">take you Ginevra Molly Weasley to be my wife,…</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">take you Harry James Potter to be my husband, </em></p><p class="calibre7">to have and to hold from this day forward,…</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">to have and to hold from this day forward,</em></p><p class="calibre7">for better, for worse,…</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">for better, for worse,</em></p><p class="calibre7">for richer, for poorer,…</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">for richer, for poorer,</em></p><p class="calibre7">in sickness and in health,</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">in sickness and in health,…</em></p><p class="calibre7">to love and to cherish,</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">to love and to cherish,…</em></p><p class="calibre7">until we are parted by death.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">until we are parted by death. </em></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">This is my solemn vow. </strong></p><p class="calibre7">The minister raised his wand and a shower of silver stars rose out above their heads as Harry gave Ginny a soft kiss. She giggled slightly and they turned to face everyone, harry raising their clasped hands high. They quickly retreated down the aisle as everyone stood to applause.</p><p class="calibre7">They entered the small dressing room on the front side of the church and sat down.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, my feet are killing me." She said as she rubbed at her foot. Harry laughed as he wrapped and arm around her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">"and just think, we still have the reception."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh all that dancing," she grimaced.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he picked up her coat. "Come on, we've got a while before we have to apparate back to the Burrow. Let's go for a walk, the cold snow should help your feet."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at him doubtfully but slipped into the coat anyway.</p><p class="calibre7">They walked idly around the grounds of the church, "Do you like my dress?" Ginny asked motioning at her attire.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's beautiful," Harry said pulling her in a little closer. He cleared his throat, "Would you like." He stopped and looked at her. "Would you like to see my parents?" he asked unsure.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked up at him, wide eyed. She nodded slowly and he began leading her into the small cemetery. A few rows back her stopped at The large gravestone, the white marble had a thin layer of snow resting upon it, obscuring the names beneath. Harry knelt by the stone and gently wiped his gloved cover hand across it, revealing the names of Lily and James Potter. They sat there for a moment, in silence, before Harry spoke up. In an unsure tone he uttered the small phrase to know one in particular. "This is Ginny, My wife." He looked back up and smiled at her. She couldn't think of a better first introduction as his wife than to his dead parents. She gently placed her hand on his shoulder and he brought his up to rest on top of it.</p><p class="calibre7">She stood silently by his side as he bowed his head in silence, until after a few minutes he squeezed her hand. "I think it time we headed to the reception." He said still starring ahead at the white marble.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded silently as he stood and wrapped and arm around her waist. "I'm sure Kingsley has gotten the cars out of here already." He mused as he lead her back out of the graveyard and to the back alley where they were to apparated from.</p><p class="calibre7">He kissed her gently. "thank you Gin." He smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"For what?"</p><p class="calibre7">"For going with me to see them. It really meant a lot to me."</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, you know I'd always go with you. And well…" she stopped and took his hands in hers. "It means a lot to me that you would bring me here. Share this with me." She looked down as the soft blush began covering her face.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry lifted up her chin to look her in the eye, before kissing her deeply. "I Love you Ginny."</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too Harry." She smiled as he kissed her again, just before apparating them away.</p>
