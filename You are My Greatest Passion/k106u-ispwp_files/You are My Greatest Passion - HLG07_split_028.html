<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_29">*Chapter 28*: Chapter 28</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Wow just read an interview with JKR and she say that only Hermione goes back to Hogwarts, which totally contradicts my story. Damn. And I tried so hard to keep it canon. W/E.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Okay new thing, if you vote on the poll or review guess what you get? A COOKIE! YAE! Everyone loves cookies. Of course you will have to get said cookie for yourself, but still. Okay enjoy!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">OMG MAJOR SMUT WARNING. NOT FOR THE KIDDIES! IM NOT JOKING. ENJOY.</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p class="calibre7">A few months later the weather turned a bit cool as august rolled in and the Quidditch season was nearing its end. Ginny was almost relieved, she came home exhausted and almost never saw harry or family, except at games. Harry attended everyone, usually in the company of Ron. He would always cheer loudly and bring her flowers, specifically Calla Lilies. Then after she had played, he would take her out, usually to a small-unknown diner where they would not be recognized. After the scandal with the Prophet at the first Quidditch match, Harry was determined to try to keep their relationship out of the public eye.</p><p class="calibre7">But now the season was almost over, and Ginny hoped the press would die down some, the only responsibility she had left to really fulfill was her photo for the annual Holyhead Harpies Calendar.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat in the livingroom of the flat she shared with Harry, thumbing through the current issue of W.I.T.C.H Weekly. She could hear Harry getting out of the shower and smiled. It was Saturday and neither of them had to work. It was the first day they had to spend together in a long while.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry finally came out into the living room, dressed in just his boxer shorts. Ginny laughed at him as he sat on the couch next to her. "Going super casual today Harry?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't see you making any effort to get all dressed up." He replied, motioning to the sleep shorts and shirt she was wearing.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny just shrugged and went back to her magazine.</p><p class="calibre7">"Anything interesting?" Harry asked after a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah there was this amazing article on dental spells, how to keep your teeth their brightest." She laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sounds amazing," Harry said as he slowly trailed his hand up her bare thigh.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you serious?" Ginny asked looking down at his hand. "It's not even noon."</p><p class="calibre7">"And?" Harry asked lifting his hand to the hem of her shorts and leaning over to suck on her neck.</p><p class="calibre7">"How you can be ready to go twenty-four seven I will never know." She said getting off the couch and heading towards the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginnnnyy." Harry whined. She turned around and laughed at the pouting face he had put on.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" she asked as she moved to stand in front of him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Please?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Please what Harry?" she asked leaning down and whispering in his ear.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uhh. Come onâ€¦" he asked as he pulled down his boxers. He stroked himself a few times before pulling Ginny down into his lap. He sucked softly on her neck and she could feel him pressing into her upper thigh.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny whispered into his ear. "What do you want Harry?" she asked in her best seductive voice.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry moaned, and thrust his hips up towards her. "You," he moaned in a low voice, he grabbed her hand and led it down towards himself.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny grabbed him, unlike the first time she had done this for him, she now knew what to expect, and according to Harry was getting fairly good at it.</p><p class="calibre7">She rubbed him hard, up and down. She watched as Harry closed his eyes and let his head fall to the back of the couch. "Gods Ginny. You are amazing. Oh." He moaned again and Ginny had to stifle a giggle at the expression on his face.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked down at where her hand was moving. <em class="calibre9">I wonder if he would like it if I licked it. I like it when he uses his mouth on me </em>she looked at Harry, his eyes were still closed she carefully began to climb out of his lap to kneel on the floor, never breaking her stride. She watched her hand move for a minute before removing it. Harry gave a small whimper at the loss of contact but gasped loudly when Ginny stuck out her tongue and let it trail from the base to the tip.</p><p class="calibre7">"God Ginny, your killing me." He said as she slightly hovered her mouth above him. She quickly shaped her lips and moved her mouth to cover him. She sucked slightly and Harry moved his hands to grip her hair tightly. He pulled tightly at her hair when she pushed him deeper in her mouth.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ouch Harry," Ginny said as she pulled back. "Not so hard."</p><p class="calibre7">"Sorry, just please. Don't stop." Harry moaned, lightening his grip slightly and Ginny moved back to her task.</p><p class="calibre7">She sucked hard and Harry started panting.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron and Hermione stepped out of Harry's floo a moment later, and were meet with a scene they were not expecting. Ron looked on in horror as his sisters head bobbed up in down in Harry's lap.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh my god I'm going to be sick," Ron yelled as he covered his mouth and ran for the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre7">When Ginny heard her brother her eyes widened in horror and she jumped to her feet. She turned around and faced Hermione.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you doing here?" Ginny asked horrified as Harry quickly picked up his boxers and slipped into them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your Mum and Dad are on their way over." Hermione let out quickly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What? Why?" Ginny shrieked she looked down at herself; she was still in her nightclothes and was pretty positive her hair was messed up from Harry's hands. <em class="calibre9">Oh, harry. </em>She looked over at him. He was still sitting on the couch in his boxers with a dazed look on his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry go get dressed." She nearly yelled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why?" Harry asked looking up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because my parents are on their way over here."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Harry's eyes widened before he jumped off the couch and ran for the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was walking out of the bedroom smoothing down her top when her Mother walked out of the floo, followed closely by her father.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear," Molly gushed as she walked over and took her daughters face in her hands. "Eating okay?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and Molly moved on to sit on the couch.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny quickly surveyed the room; Hermione was sitting next to Ron, who still looked as if he was going to be sick again at any moment, to Harry who was now fully dressed-but still looking quite nervous.</p><p class="calibre7">She walked over to sit by him and placed a calming hand on his leg. Harry looked down at her hand before taking it in his own.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum what brings you over, unannounced?" Ginny asked after awhile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh it the greatest thing ever." Molly started. "This morning when I got up there was an owl waiting. From Bill." She smiled brightly, she grabbed Arthur's hand. "Were going to be grandparents!" she squeezed Arthurs hand tightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Fleur's pregnant?" Ginny asked. The thought of Fleur being a mother somewhat frightened Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, they've just found out. She's due in late April, early May. Isn't it wonderful." Molly smile brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just great." Ginny said.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wait," Harry said. "I thought you said you were too young to be a grandparent?" Harry asked, a bit of teasing humor in his tone.</p><p class="calibre7">"No," molly said seriously. "I said I'm too young for Ginny to make me a grandparent. So don't you get any ideas." She finished pointing at Harry. He just laughed.</p>
