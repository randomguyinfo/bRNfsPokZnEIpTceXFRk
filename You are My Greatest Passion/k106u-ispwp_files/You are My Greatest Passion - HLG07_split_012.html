<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_13">*Chapter 12*: Chapter 12</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Hehe. Here's the rest. hope you enjoy it. Leave me reviews! lol. Oh yeah i dont own hp!</strong></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre4">What you didn't say anything about pants." she giggled before going back to the task at hand.</strong></em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre4">And that was her mistake.</strong></em></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twelve</p><p class="calibre7">Seamus awoke to the sound of <em class="calibre9">Giggling? No there is no way that's what it was.</em> He sat up in his bed and surveyed the room, everyone was asleep. He was about to lay back down when he heard the noise again and noticed a rustling behind the curtains of Harry's bed. A smile began to form across Seamus' face and he slowly got out of bed and tiptoed over to Dean's. He silently nudged Dean awake and motioned for him to be silent. Dean gave him a questioning look before Seamus pointed towards Harry's bed. Dean's eyes widened and a look of shock came over his face before Seamus motioned for him to follow as they headed towards Neville's bed. He thought it be best if they woke up the brother of the girl who was most likely behind the curtains last. They quickly woke Neville up and made their way to the side of Ron's bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Who wants to do the honors' of waking him?" Seamus asked with a small chuckle.</p><p class="calibre7">"You noticed them, you do it." Dean argued.</p><p class="calibre7">"Fine" Seamus said feigning irritation. He slowly reached out to Ron and slowly tried to nudge him awake. He proved harder than the others did and Seamus actually had to push him rather hard before Ron finally stirred.</p><p class="calibre7">"what." he said with his eyes still closed.</p><p class="calibre7">Seamus smiled before pointing at Harry's bed and the pile of cloths next to it. Ron abruptly sat up and his eyes widened. The three others sat on the edge of Ron's bed. "Listen to them in there" Dean mused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh harry." Ginny moaned deeply. He was massaging her breast and sucking on her neck, with such vigor, that it was driving her mad. She ran her hands down his back and let them slip just below the waistband of his boxers before sliding them back up his back and pressing him into her. He moaned when she pressed her hips into him. They had long abandoned her skirt and now lay, Harry clad only in his boxers and Ginny in her lacy blue knickers. He had commented earlier about how much he liked them and Ginny made a mental note to buy more of the same style in every color.</p><p class="calibre7">"There not in there doing what I think their doing. Are they?" Ron asked, a bit afraid of the answer.</p><p class="calibre7">"It sure sounds like it." Seamus snickered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well someone stop them!"</p><p class="calibre7">"Nah mate" Dean said shaking his head. "If they are doing that I really don't care to see it." the thought of seeing his former girlfriend and one his best mates in the act did not exactly go over well with him.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron huffed and looked at the others. His eyes stopped at Neville, who eyes went wide and quickly shook his head no. Ron then turned to Seamus who was still sporting a cheeky grin.</p><p class="calibre7">"If you want to see it mate" and he took a step towards the bed being careful not to step on the small pile of clothes.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stopped what he was doing, very much to Ginny's dislike. She had enjoyed that thing he was doing with his tongue. She looked up at him quizzically.</p><p class="calibre7">"Did you hear something?" he asked while straining to hear. He could have sworn he hear Seamus laughing. <em class="calibre9">Oh no, what if we woke them up. </em>He gulped. <em class="calibre9">What if we woke Ron up, he will kill me.</em></p><p class="calibre7">Ginny must have sensed his anxiety because she reached up, wrapped her arms around his neck, and pulled him back down into a kiss. "Don't worry love. Everyone's asleep and will be for a few more hours." then she pulled him back down. She slowly and gently sucked on his bottom lip. She ran one hand up into his hair and the other lower down to the small of his back. Harry lowered himself back down onto her and brought his hand up into her hair. He let them tangle there for a few minutes before letting one trail its way down to her breast. He gripped it roughly and Ginny moaned before biting his bottom lip. He expected it to hurt but found that he rather liked it. Harry pressed into her breast again in hopes that she would moan again, but this time she thrust her hips up into his and Harry marveled at how good it felt. He returned the motion and was surprised when she gripped his head and moaned into his ear. "Harry" she breathed heavily "do that again." Harry pressed himself onto her repeatedly while roughly massaging her breast and kissing her with such a passion that he knew it would be much longer. He was just about to crash when a noise behind the curtain caused him to look up just before it was pulled back.</p><p class="calibre7">"What the hell!" Ron yelled. Seamus stood stunned with the edge of Harry bed, curtain still in his hand. Neville and Dean suddenly found the floor very interesting.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry leapt from the bed, Ron was happy to see he at least still had his shorts on, and stood on the opposite side from Ron and the others. Ginny pulled the blanket up to cover her bare chest.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, mate ummâ€¦" Harry stumble to find the right words. "This isn't what it looks like?" he said scratching his head, he wasn't sure it that was right though. <em class="calibre9">What does this look like?</em></p><p class="calibre7">"Yes it is." Harry was surprised to hear Ginny say. "Now all of you back to bed." she gave them all one last look, daring them to challenge her before they all headed back to their respective beds, except Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked down at Ginny then up to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Look I know I said I'd be more accepting of your relationship but don't you think this is pushing it just a little bit?" he asked with a look of defeat on his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"What your saying is you wouldn't be doing the same with Hermione if she was here?" Ginny said in a newly found calm voice.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well." Ron began to protest, "Yeah I guess you're right. Just could you at least cast a silencing charm next time." he shuddered at the thought of a next time and Ginny laughed. "Seriously Seamus was having a field day listing to you." he smiled at his sister before the realization, that she was lying there half-naked hit him. "Oh, well, um I'm going to bed." he quickly jumped in his bed and pulled the curtains tight.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat down on the edge of the bed and leaned back to put his head in Ginny's lap.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well that was interesting."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I guess it was." she half chuckled while running a hand through his hair.</p><p class="calibre7">She leaned back against his pillow and patted the space next to her. "Come to bed" Harry smiled at her before he crawled up the bed next to her and slid beneath the covers. He laid his head against the pillow and wrapped his arms around Ginny who had melded herself into his side and placed her head on his chest. He lazily ran his hand through her hair for a moment before bend to kiss the top of her head. "I love you Ginny." "I love you too Harry" and with that they silently fell into sleep.</p>
