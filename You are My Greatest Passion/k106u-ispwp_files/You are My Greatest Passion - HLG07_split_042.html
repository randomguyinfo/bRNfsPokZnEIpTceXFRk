<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_43">*Chapter 42*: Chapter 42</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: A cookie to whoever can guess the movie Ginny associates the chandelier with.</p><p class="calibre7">Whew, just finished painting the floor for the school i tech at. Amazing way to spend your saturday, covered in black paint. Yea! Okay, enjoy the chapter, read and review!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: Finally getting your colorguard performance floor painted=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Forty-Two</p><p class="calibre7">They arrived on the outskirts of the Burrow. Across the small field they could see the large tent, brightly lit up as the music drifted towards them.</p><p class="calibre7">"You ready?" Harry asked, squeezing her hand. Ginny nodded and they slowly began making their way toward the tent.</p><p class="calibre7">Out front, Molly was fidgeting her hands. She had been waiting nearly twenty-minutes for Harry and Ginny. People were getting a bit restless and were ready for them to arrive.</p><p class="calibre7">She peered out across the field when she saw two figures in the distance.</p><p class="calibre7">As they came closer she let out a low "Finally."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly tightly embraced Harry and Ginny when they arrived at the tent entrance.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh goodness, what took you so long?" she asked placing her hands on her hips after she had let them go. "We've had everyone lined up for ages. Laura and Lynn kept trying to sneak off to play." She huffed and Harry couldn't help but smiled. The Prewett twins reminded him oddly of Fred and George.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sorry, we stopped off at my parent's grave." Harry said as he began following Molly to where the rest of the wedding party was lined up.</p><p class="calibre7">She stopped and turned abruptly. "Oh Harry I'm sorry dear. I should have realized. Did you get enough time. You can go back if you need to, we can wait." She stumbled over her words to get everything out.</p><p class="calibre7">"Molly its fine," Harry laughed putting a reassuring hand on her arm. "Were ready to go in and eat." He laughed again as he looked at Ginny who nodded in agreement.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly gave a short,silent nod before leading them to stand behind Ron and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny watched excitedly as Ron and Hermione disappeared into the tent. She hadn't seen the decorations yet, but somehow she knew they'd be perfect. She waited impatiently for the band leader to announce them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, calm down." Harry laughed from beside her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I can't help it. I'm excited…and Hungry. I haven't ate since breakfast." She said exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed deeply. "You and Ron are more alike than you know."</p><p class="calibre7">"what is that supposed to…" she started to ask before she was cut off by the booming voice of the Band leader calling their names.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's time to go in." Harry said as he grabbed her arm and started walking towards the tent opening.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny watched in amazement as the ceiling of the large tent sparkled with a million twinkling lights. They slowly made their way through the tables to the dance floor in the center. Above them hung an illustrious chandelier worthy of the muggle movie Harry had taken her to see once. <em class="calibre9">Something about a distorted man and an opera house. </em>She though fleetingly as Harry turned her to face him.</p><p class="calibre7">A soft melody began to play from the corner of the tent where the band had set up, and Harry pulled her closely to him as they began to sway in time.</p><p class="calibre7">"This is nice," he commented as he pushed his face into her neck and breathed in the scent of her shampoo.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, Mum really went all out with the decorations. This is more than I imagi…" Harry cut her off by lifting his head and bringing a finger to her lips.</p><p class="calibre7">"The decorations are nice, but that's not what I was talking about." He laughed softly. "I was talking about this." He motioned between the two of them, "being married. Its just feels right."</p><p class="calibre7">"I know what you mean." Said as she stood on her toes to give him a kiss. "I love you." She smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too." He said as he spun her once again.</p><p class="calibre7">When the dance finished they quickly made their way to the head table and sat in between Ron and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron lightly punched Harry on the shoulder. "Welcome to the family. Officially." He said smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks Ron." Harry said as the food appeared on his plate.</p><p class="calibre7">"Finally, I'm ravished." Ron said as he shoveled into his plate without reserve.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gawked at her brother for a moment before turning to Hermione. "I don't know what you see in him."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, " Hermione said covering her mouth as she took a small bite. "You have to look beneath the surface." She laughed as she looked over at Ron. She watched as he shoveled the food down for a moment before exclaiming. "Ronald breath between bites!" he looked up at her fairly amused before going back to his plate.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry silently watched the exchange between Ron and Hermione. He was elated that after all these years that they had finally come together and were happy.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled as he grasped Ginny's hand. She turned to him and smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Cake!" Molly yelled above the crowd of dancing people. "Harry, Ginny its time to cut the cake."</p><p class="calibre7">They quickly managed their way over to the round table that housed the cake.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wow Gin, its beautiful." Harry said looking at the delicate frosting lilies that covered the cake. He tentatively reached a hand out to touch one, but was smacked down by Hermione who had made her way over.</p><p class="calibre7">"Other people have to eat it to you know." She said, "your just as bad as Ron." A bit of playfulness in her stern voice.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly came by to join them as she handed them a cake server. Harry carefully covered Ginny's hands with his own as they cut the first piece. As it was plated he grabbed a small piece and placed it in her mouth, carefully not to get any frosting on her.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled proud of himself as Ginny gently picked up her piece. He opened his mouth expecting her to be as restrained as he had been, but soon found that was too much to hope for.</p><p class="calibre7">"You got it up my nose!" he cried as he reached blindly for a napkin. His glasses were covered in a thick layer of frosting as was, he assumed, the rest of his face.</p><p class="calibre7">He heard Ginny off to the side laughing hysterically as he tried to clean himself. Hermione finally taking pity on him, muttered a cleansing charm and he was once again able to see.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked over to where Ginny was standing holding her sides furiously, as feint tear lines streaked her face. He pointed to her and mouthed 'you' before heading towards her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny quickly took off around the edge of the tent, laughing as she ran.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," she squealed. "not fair." Taking in a deep breath. "I'm wearing a dress."</p><p class="calibre7">She headed out of the tent and into the field, Harry right behind her.</p><p class="calibre7">She had reached the middle of the field when she felt his hands grabbed her waist and pulled her back to him.</p><p class="calibre7">She tried in vain to calm her breathing as he lowered his head to her ear. "Gotcha." He whispered softly.</p><p class="calibre7">He pulled her closer and let out a soft, 'oh' as she pressed against him. She turned to face him and wrapped her arms tightly around his neck.</p><p class="calibre7">They stood there for a moment, just staring intently at each other before she lifted up to softly kiss him. She moved her head to softly whisper in his ear, "I think I'm ready to leave."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked at her and smiled brightly. "Well lets go say goodbye," he said softly, nipping at her neck.</p><p class="calibre7">They walked hand in hand back to the tent to find Molly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum, I think were going to head off. Its been a long day." She said as she sharply nudged Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yes um. Long day." He quickly faked a yawn, to which Ginny rolled her eyes at.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sure that's why you want to leave," Molly said skeptically. "but nonetheless dear, you still need to throw your bouquet."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yeah." Ginny said looking at the flowers she had left resting on the head table. "well lets do it now."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly sighed but began to gather the women anyway.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny retrieved her flowers and made her way back to the dance floor. She stood smiling for a moment, watching the women gather, before turning a throwing the small flower arrangement with all her might into the crowd.</p><p class="calibre7">It sailed gracefully towards the back, and Ginny admired her pitching skills, before a long slender arm reached up and plucked it from its skyward trip.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked down to see a blushing Angelina Johnson, clutching the bouquet to her chest.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry watched George's expression as the girls congratulated Angelina on her catch.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's the one who catches it supposed to be the next married?" Neville asked, smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">George just nodded, his brow furrowed and silent for once in his life. Harry patted him one the shoulder, "Well, looks like you'll be joining the club." He laughed and George swatted at him. "eh, I don't think your sister would like it to much if you hurt me." Harry laughed, moving out of the way of Georges arm and moving to stand next to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ready to go?" he asked, slipping an arm around her waist. Ginny nodded in consent, as they made their way over to the Portkey, that would take them to the Honeymoon suite they had booked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny hugged each of her brothers in turn, as they gathered around the old vase. Molly quickly engulfed the couple in a hug before they took each others hand and headed to stand next to the vase.</p><p class="calibre7">"You take care of our sisters virtue." Bill said jokingly pointing at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"What do you mean," Ron snorted, "He took care of that a long time ago." he emphasized his words before taking another drink from his glass.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shot Ron a look worthy of death, as the other brothers processed this information.</p><p class="calibre7">"Whats that supposed to mean?" Charlie asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing you need to worry about." Ginny said innocently from besides Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked at the brothers lined up, <em class="calibre9">okay I believe its time to leave.</em> He thought as he reached his hand out towards the vase. He muttered a quick good bye and grasped Ginny's waist with one hand and the vase with the other. <em class="calibre9">Best to leave before they have time to get truly upset. </em>He though as they swirled into the middle of their room.</p>
