<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_6">*Chapter 5*: Chapter 5</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter 5*</strong></p><p class="calibre7">After breakfast the next day Harry sat on the floor in his bedroom with the contents of the folder from Gringotts spread front of him.</p><p class="calibre7">He leaned back on the side of the bed and furiously rubbed the bridge of his nose. He didn't understand any of this and was getting a headache.</p><p class="calibre7">He was about to say sod it all and take a nap when there was a soft knock on his door.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" He answered a little more harshly than he had intended to.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked up at the door as it opened. There stood Ginny in a white t-shirt and some much worn jeans.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey." She said softly as she moved to take a seat next to him. She picked up the paper closest to her and examined it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you need any help with this?" She motioned at the papers lying haphazardly across the floor.</p><p class="calibre7">"I just can't seem to understand any of it. It's like it's in a different language." He put his hands on his temples and rubbed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well this for example," She motioned to the paper in her hand "Is the deed to Number 12 Grimmauld Place."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked at her shocked and grabbed the paper</p><p class="calibre7">"How can you tell that? I've looked at this same paper three times and didn't see that." He held up three fingers as he spoke.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed as she pointed at the top of the paper where it read DEED and then lower where it listed the address.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry wrapped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close to him and gave her a kiss on top of her head. "What would I do without you?" He let go of her and picked up another piece of paper "What's this one?"</p><p class="calibre7">She grabbed the paper and examined it.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's another deed." She paused for a moment and her face became serious.</p><p class="calibre7">"What is it?" Harry asked, concern marring his voice.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's the deed to your Parent's house in Godrics Hallow." She looked up at him unsure of how he would react to this. He just smiled and took the paper. He sat it on top of the deed to Grimmauld Place and picked up another paper and handed it to her.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry was shocked to find that he, the boy who truly felt he never had a true home, now held the Deed's to two separate houses.</p><p class="calibre7">The next thing that shocked him was that on top his vault at Gringotts that he knew about, there were two he didn't, and they both contained more gold than the first. After finding this out Harry looked uneasily at Ginny. She had an embarrassed blush on her face but ignored it and had moved on to the next paper.</p><p class="calibre7">It was a list of items placed in the vaults. Several Pieces of jewelry, a Pensive; Which Harry was very excited about owning, A share in the Cuddly Cannons; Which Harry's dad had bought when he was at Hogwarts;<em class="calibre9"> I'll have to keep that a secret from Ron,it would make an awesome Christmas present</em>, And a security box which didn't divulge what was inside.</p><p class="calibre7">The next few papers were a collection of things ranging from a list of people who owed the Black family money to a detailed list of Harry's spending since he'd had access to his vault. Harry picked up another paper and stared blankly at in for a minute before slamming it down. Ginny picked it up and examined it.</p><p class="calibre7">"700 pounds a month?" She asked shock evident in her tone.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah." Harry responded calmly "And yet they could never afford to buy me new things, I always had to do with Dudley's old hand-me-downs." He took the paper back from her "If I would have know they were getting this much every month for taking care of me…" He trailed off. "Do you know what these are?" He asked Ginny picking up a small bundle of rectangular papers.</p><p class="calibre7">"No," She said flipping through them, "But Mum or Dad might."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded and pushed them into his pocket before continuing to sort the remaining papers. After two hours they had everything sorted and organized in to their respective piles. Harry careful put them all away and leaned back on the bed. To his surprise and delight, Ginny laid down next to him and put her head on his chest. He ran his hand through her hair and marveled at her beauty. He bent his head down and planted a kiss on the top of her head. She turned up to him and smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny I..."The words caught in his throat. He had never said what he was about to say to anyone and on top of that he wasn't sure how Ginny would react to him telling her that after only a few days back together.</p><p class="calibre7">"You what Harry?" He decided to abandon the idea of telling Ginny that he loved her and quickly shifted the conversation.</p><p class="calibre7">"I…I think lunch is ready." He jumped off the floor, nearly knocking her over in the process, and began for the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shall we?" He asked opening the door and motioning downstairs.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked at him uncertainly before getting up off the floor and heading downstairs.</p><p class="calibre7">They reached the first floor landing and were surprised to hear a familiar voice. They headed into the family room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah Harry there you are. Minerva has something she would like to speak with you about" Mrs. Weasley said excitedly. "Ginny why don't you come help me finish lunch."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry took the chair next to where Professor McGonagall sat as Ginny followed Mrs. Weasley into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry I'm here to ask you a favor of sorts." She asked as soon as he had sat down. Harry nodded to the Professor indicating she should continue.</p><p class="calibre7">"We'll as you have probably heard the ministry has requested that we continue on with Defense Against the Dark Arts classes, even though the major threats have now been vanquished." She took a deep breath before continuing. "We had a bit of trouble finding someone this year. Finally we had to have the Ministry appoint someone."</p><p class="calibre7">"That sounds good" Harry said hesitantly, he couldn't tell if she was happy about having a Ministry appointed Official back at Hogwarts after the fiasco with Umbridge.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, it truly is." she said to Harry's relief, "The only problem is that he wouldn't be able to be there full time, as he still has duties at the Ministry." Harry wasn't exactly sure where this conversation was going, but he had a terrible feeling. "Harry, I need to ask you a favor."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed. <em class="calibre9">Hadn't he done enough?</em> He was about to get upset until he looked the again Professor and saw the worried look in her eyes and etched on her face. He felt sorry for her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Anything Professor." The words seemed to soften her face a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well since Professor Williamson won't be there full time we've decided to appoint him an assistant. To help him keep track of class schedules and lessons, and on occasion, this assistant may be required to teach a lesson or two."</p><p class="calibre7">After she stopped talking she stared at Harry. Now he knew where this was going, she wanted him to be the Defense against the Dark Arts assistant. He wasn't sure if he wanted to take on that responsibility. She must have sensed his doubt because she continued.</p><p class="calibre7">"On top of having one of you classes changed to a planning period with Professor Williamson, you will also receive an additional free period." She paused to make sure he had heard her correctly. "And I have spoken with Minister Shacklebolt and he has agreed to use the time you spend assisting Professor Williamson toward your hours that you must meet in Auror training." She stopped but then added sharply, "It is a very valuable arrangement, if you don't mind me saying."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled as he thought about it for a moment. While he didn't want any additional responsibilities, it might be okay, maybe it would be just like the DA again, just permitted this time. <em class="calibre9">And</em> he would be earning hours for Auror training which would help a lot when he left school.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay Professor, I'll do it." He smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank goodness." She sighed. "Well I must be going I've got lots to do and not much time left." she began heading for the door but paused with her hand on the knob, she turned back to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just to let you know you will not be the only assistant at Hogwarts this year. Neville has agreed to be Professor Spouts while he studies Herbology, and Miss Chang will be assisting Professor Flitwick." She smiled at him before opening the door and heading off towards the apparation point.</p><p class="calibre7">A few minutes later Molly busted into the room with Ginny right behind her. Apparently she knew what McGonagall was there about and had informed Ginny too.</p><p class="calibre7">"So what did you say Harry?" Molly inquired excitably.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shrugged his shoulders, and Molly looked disappointed until he smiled and told her he had said he had agreed to do it. He was then forced into one of Molly Weasley's world famous bone crushing hugs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well that's just wonderful dear." She told him before she turned and headed back into the kitchen to finish the lunch.</p><p class="calibre7">Now Harry that was left alone once again with Ginny, she causally walked up to him and ran a finger down his chest.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Potter what are you planning on doing with all that free time?" She asked with a sly smile.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry could feel his face getting warm.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, but I'll think of something." He smiled as he pulled her in to him, kissing her with more fervor than he had before. They were just really sinking into it when Ron came down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oi!" they both looked up and blushed "What did I say about not snogging in front of me?" He looked around uncomfortably. "Is lunch ready yet?"</p><p class="calibre7">They both laughed and the three of them headed into the kitchen for lunch.</p><p class="calibre7">That night at dinner they talked about trivial things until Harry remembered something.</p><p class="calibre7">He reached into his pocket and pulled out the small bunch of paper slips from Gringotts he held them out to Molly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mrs. Wesley, would you happen to know what these are?"</p><p class="calibre7">Mrs. Weasley blushed. "Well Harry those are Vault slips"</p><p class="calibre7">"Vault slips?" Harry questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes. For if you want to buy something buy don't have any gold on you. You fill out one of these and the vendor redeems it at Gringotts." Her blush seemed to deepen. "They are usually reserved only for Wizarding families that have a significant amount of gold in ones vault. The Goblins want to make sure you don't promise away money you don't have. I think when I last check you have to have a balance of, Oh Arthur what was it, Ten-Thousand Gallons?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron chocked on his stew and spit it out all over his shirt.</p><p class="calibre7">"Did you say Ten-Thousand?" Ron asked, still sputtering stew.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes Ronald I did, now can you try and not make a mess everywhere?" She said as she scourgifed the stew off the table.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry blushed a shade worthy of only the Weasley's as Molly handed him the book of slips back. He sank into his chair even further when the conversation didn't manage to pick back up again.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny did all she could to keep from staring. She smiled and placed a warm hand on Harry's shoulder he looked over at her and gave a meek smile, before containing to eat.</p><p class="calibre7">After dinner Ron and Harry played a game of chess while Ginny sat on the couch reading the latest issue of W.I.T.C.H.</p><p class="calibre7">Suddenly Molly came in, looking very uncomfortable.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, Harry." They looked up as their respective names were called. "Arthur would like to have a word with you two in the kitchen." She dropped her head and quickly went to sit on the couch next to Ginny, who in turn gave her a questioning look. Molly dropped her voice and whispered something to her that Harry couldn't hear. Ginny had to do everything she could to keep from rolling on the floor laughing. The boys just looked at each other and shrugged before they headed into the kitchen not really knowing what to expect.</p><p class="calibre7">When they entered they saw a very serious looking Mr. Weasley sitting at the table. He motioned for them to sit down. After they did he summoned them each a butterbeer from the fridge.</p><p class="calibre7">"Boys, Molly thinks, and I guess I agree, that I should have a talk with both of you before you return to school this year." Ron and Harry both looked at each other confused, then returned there gazes to Mr. Weasley.</p><p class="calibre7">"Although I probably should have done this last year. Generally you have this talk when a Wizard turns 17 but..." He trailed off before promptly turning the color of a beet. He fidgeted with his drink a little before he began to speak again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now when a Wizard and a Witch fancy, no, no that's not right. When they love each other…" Harry now knew where this was going and he didn't want any part in it. He hadn't had the "sex" talk before but he really didn't want it to come from his girlfriend's father. He quickly thought of a way to get out of it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Excuse me, Mr. Weasley."</p><p class="calibre7">Mr. Weasley stopped right in the middle of a rant on the importance of contraceptive spells and potions and looked at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sirius already explained all this to me. Can I go?" He blurted out quickly.</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur just nodded, and Ron gave him a reprehensible stare as he left the room. He felt bad about lying to Mr. Weasley but there was no way he could have that talk with him.</p><p class="calibre7">As Harry climbed the stairs to his room he thought of ways he could get the information he would one day need. Maybe Ginny would already know all that stuff, but he knew very well he could not make her totally responsible. He decided that he would take the Hermione route of things and go down to Diagon Alley tomorrow to get a book on it. Happy with his decision he laid down in bed and fell asleep.</p>
