<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_52">*Chapter 51*: Chapter 51</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: As for the time of Ginny's
reaction, I put in that she eight weeks, thus it's eight weeks after
the first entry. Yes some of Harry and Ginny's children are the same
age as Ron and Hermione, But James isn't. Okay, I hope I explained
everything. lol. Read, Review and Enjoy...</p><p class="calibre7">AND OMG IVE BEEN TRYING TO UPLOAD THIS
FOR THREE DAYS! IT WOULDNT LET ME LOG IN! SOO SORRY!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: I DON'T OWN HARRY POTTER!
Te-He.</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty-One</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny walked through the back door,
Harry close behind her, a cautious hand on her back.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum," she said quietly causing
Molly to look up from the veggies she had set to chopping. "Can we
talk to you, and Dad, in private?" she asked timidly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry almost laughed at seeing Ginny so
scared, and he probably would have if he wasn't terrified himself.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly nodded and motioned for them to
sit before hollering into the next room for Arthur.</p><p class="calibre7">She took a seat across from the table
and eyed them suspiciously.</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur came in a second later, the
Daily Prophet tucked beneath his arm. "Yes Molly?" he asked
taking a seat.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny and harry say they have
something to tell us-Privately." she added at the end.</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur nodded before turning to gaze at
the couple.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny took a deep breath and squeezed
Harry's hand beneath the table.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum, Dad. Were having a baby."</p><p class="calibre7">"I know!" Molly let out. Ginny just
stared at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"How can you know, I just found out?"
Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Dear I've know since Christmas."
Molly said excitedly.</p><p class="calibre7">"But how could you know?" Ginny
asked again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Dear, you don't have seven children
and not know the signs of pregnancy." Molly laughed before bringing
a hand to cover her mouth. "Oh Arthur, our baby's having a baby!"
she shrieked.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he wrapped an arm
around Ginny's shoulders. "Well that was easier than expected."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny stood in the middle of
the baby department in a large department store.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry which one?" Ginny asked,
holding up two packages.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know," Harry replied,
setting the rattle he had been playing with down and walking over to
her. "Why do we need bottles? Aren't you going to do the whole
breast thing."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at him fiercely before
dropping the boxes and wrapping her arms around her chest, "Mine"
she whispered sharply.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed for a moment, "Okay,
okay. Whatever you want." he chuckled again as he bent to pick up
the boxes. "So what's the difference between these?" he asked
turning the boxes over.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny hesitated for a moment before
dropping her arms and moving over to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well these," she pointed to the
first box "Are just regular plastic bottles. And these..." she
pointed to the other one. "Are glass." she paused for a minute.
"Eww, which considering I just dropped them, I say plastic." she
cringed and Harry laughed as he set the glass set back on the shelf.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"What's wrong with this one?" Harry
asked exasperated. <em class="calibre9">Fifth freaking house we've seen today that she
doesn't like</em> he thought sourly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know," Ginny said placing
a hand on her small stomach. "It just doesn't feel homey." she
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, homey isn't a house option. You
have to give me something else to work with." Harry huffed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I don't know." Ginny threw
her hands up. "I just don't like it."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his head slowly and rubbed
the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, okay. Lets go see the next
one." he placed a hand on Ginny's back and led her out of the large
house, Shaking his head at the wizard who was helping them search for
a house.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay," the wizard said pulling a
file out of the air. "Yes, I've got one more. It's in Glasgow
though, a little further away than you wanted." They nodded as the
wizard showed harry the coordinates and the apparated away.</p><p class="calibre7">They arrived a bit outside of the
outskirts of the city. Ginny looked up at the large iron gate. She
ran a finger down the cold iron bar before turning to Harry. "I
like this one." she said excitedly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, we haven't even see the house
yet." he shook his head.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know but, something just feels
right."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked over to see the wizard
stifling a chuckled as he unlocked the gate with his wand. They
slowly made there way up the long, winding drive to the house.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny took in a deep breath as she saw
the house. "Harry see I told you it was perfect." she said
excitedly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed lightly as he wrapped an
arm around Ginny and walked through the front doors.</p><p class="calibre7">"This is the one." Ginny said
firmly as the stood in the master suite. "I mean it has everything
we could ask for an more." she said sitting on the window seat and
stretching a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well if you like it, I like it."
Harry said sitting next her and wrapping an arm around her. Ginny</p><p class="calibre7">smiled as he kissed the top of her
head.</p><p class="calibre7">The wizard stuck his head into the room
coughing loudly. "So Mr. And Mrs. Potter, what do you think?" he
asked cautiously.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled down at Ginny, "I think
we've found the one."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"No Ron. That box needs to go in the
other room!" Ginny said irately as Ron picked up the misplaced box
again.</p><p class="calibre7">"What other room Gin, there are
several and, if you haven't noticed, I'm not a bloody mind reader."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron..." Harry said cautiously as
he walked up next to him, his arms full. "just let it go."</p><p class="calibre7">"Bloody pregnancy hormones..." Ron
mumbled as he followed Harry out of the room.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"I think that was the last box,"
Harry said as he took a seat on the couch and opened his butterbeer.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank the lord," Ron said plopping
down next to him. "If I had to take one more order from her..."
he let his sentence trail off, shaking a fist a Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Leave her alone, its not her fault."
Harry sighed before taking another drink. "Besides, only what, four
months left?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron nodded vacantly. "I'm never
having kids, if it's going to turn Hermione into that." he pointed
at Ginny and Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"You know there are plus sides."
Harry said calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, like Gins becoming a plus
size." Ron laughed as Harry punched him in the arm.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hush, she's really touchy about her
weight right now. Besides, its not that much really, its just looks
like it on her."</p><p class="calibre7">Ron nodded, but still snickered into
his bottle.</p><p class="calibre7">"Anyway," Harry started again
"Thats not what I was talking about." he cautiously looked around
before leaning in towards Ron. "Recently, she wants to do it, like
all the time." he whispered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Eww." Ron said loudly and Harry
held up his hand to hush him. "I don't want to hear about my sister
like that," he whispered, a disgusted look on his face.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry leaned back and shrugged.
"Whatever Ron, these past three months have been the best of my
life." he smiled as he took another sip of his butterbeer.</p><p class="calibre7">A/N: DON'T HATE GINNY FOR NOT BREAST
FEEDING! I know a lot people are really passionate about it, but that
scene was actually written from my life. Me and my hubby stood in
babies 'r' us and he asked if I was breast feeding, to which I
promptly covered my chest protectively and told him hell no, there
mine.</p>
