<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_48">*Chapter 47*: Chapter 47</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Theo3983
July 30th
2001-Molly Marie (P/A). Puts conception on Nov 6th
2000.</p><p class="calibre7">So this chapter was so freakin'
awesome...the part with Harry and Ron was perfect. The dialogue, the
descriptive tones, Then my daughter turned of my computer and of
course it wasn't saved. Fuck-my-life. I'm pissed, so here is the
shity, what I can remember version. Sorry. Lol.</p><p class="calibre7">And sorry about the lack in updating, I
lost where I was going with this, plus my guard has been having
competition every Saturday and long rehearsals, but we are currently
ranked 5th in state. I'm so proud. Lol. Enjoy, leave me
all kinds of reviews! Lol</p><p class="calibre7">Disclaimer: 5th in
state=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</p><p class="calibre7">Georges wedding was what anyone would
have expected from him.</p><p class="calibre7">He and Lee had gotten together and
planned several 'surprises' behind molly and Angelina's backs.</p><p class="calibre7">These included things from the large, a
grand firework display going off just as they were pronounced husband
and wife. To the small, mixing in several WWW products with the other
sweets set out.</p><p class="calibre7">Angelina had angrily chased George
around the tent after her sister bit into a nosebleed nugget and
dripped blood all over her bridesmaid dress.</p><p class="calibre7">As Harry and Ginny walked back towards
the Burrow, he wrapped his cloak around her shoulders as the cool
October air swirled around them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Molly's so cute." Ginny said of
the two-and-half month old,conversationally as they walked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, Kind of weird. Something that
cute coming from Percy." he laughed as they made their way through
the back door.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'll grab our bags and we can get
going." Harry said releasing Ginny's shoulders and heading up the
stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny watched as harry made his way up
the stairs. "looking at his bum?" Hermione asked from beside her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why Hermione," Ginny said holding
a hand to her chest, "I don't think I've ever heard you talk like
that." she laughed and let out a soft sigh. "but yeah, I was."
the girls laughed together again before Hermione made her way into
the family room in search of Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," Ron yelled as he stepped
out of the floo and into the small flat. "Harry, where are you?"
he yelled again as he walked down the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Harry asked annoyed as he
opened the office door.</p><p class="calibre7">"There you are," Ron smiled and
pushed past him into the small office to take a seat.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, come in, have a seat Ron."
Harry sighed as he made his way back to the desk. "Not like I'm
working or anything." he added under his breath.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron tapped his foot impatiently as
Harry went back to his papers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, can you stop that? Seriously."</p><p class="calibre7">"I need your help." Ron blurted
out.</p><p class="calibre7">"No. What you need is professional
help." Harry said under his breath.</p><p class="calibre7">"You remember when you asked Ginny to
marry you?" Harry nodded, not looking up from his parchment.</p><p class="calibre7">"And you promised if I helped you,
you'd go with me when I finally got around to asking Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre7">This earned another another vacant nod.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," Ron's voice was serious
and Harry reluctantly set down his quill and looked at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's time."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry processed this for a minute
before smiling broadly. "Your finally going to do it?" he asked
leaning back in the desk chair.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron nodded. "I'm bloody scared too."</p><p class="calibre7">"Why its just Hermione, and well her
parents I guess. Whats there to be afraid of?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Your one to talk, you were afraid to
ask Dad."</p><p class="calibre7">"Nah, it was more that I was afraid
of your Mum." he laughed getting up and putting an arm around Ron's
shoulders. "Well are you ready to go?" he asked as he slipped on
his robes.</p><p class="calibre7">"You mean...right...right now?" Ron
stammered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well yeah, you said you were ready.
Why not get it over with?" harry said leading Ron out of the office
and locking the office door.</p><p class="calibre7">"You do know where her parents live
right?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron nodded vaguely.</p><p class="calibre7">"Good, because I have no clue." he
laughed. "I guess you'll have to side-along me." he said as he
locked the apartment door and they headed into Diagon alley.
"Besides, whats there to worry about?"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Several minutes later they arrived on
the other side of England, in front of a stark white house. The
hedges that lined the yard were meticulously kept and even the tulips
that rested in the beds in front of the house even seemed to grow in
perfectly straight lines and at the same height.</p><p class="calibre7">"Whoa, now I see where Hermione gets
it from." Harry said motioning towards the house.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron nodded and started up the path.
Harry looked around the clean neighborhood, then down at his attire,
maybe his bright burgundy robes weren't the smartest thing to wear in
a muggle neighborhood. He glanced over at Ron who was dressing in
Jeans and a plain button up. <em class="calibre9">Damn, don't I look stupid</em> he
thought as Ron knocked cautiously at the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, look no one home, lets go." he
said turning as soon as his fist left the wood.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron," Harry said grabbing his
shoulders, "How bad can it really be?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron didn't have a chance to answer. A
rather thin woman stood at the front door, and for a moment Harry
could have sworn he was staring at his aunt except fro the fact the
Ms. Granger had brown hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ronald," she began, shaking Harry
from his stupor. "What an unexpected surprise. What brings you all
the way out here?" she said motioning for them to enter the house.</p><p class="calibre7">"I um, I was wondering if I could
have a word with you, and Mr. Granger if possible."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh dear, I'm sorry he's not here.
Dental conference. You understand." she said showing them to a
small sitting area in what Harry assumed was their living room. The
room was to clean and didn't seem very lived in to him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Have we met before?" She asked
turning her attention to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, I'm sorry." Ron said quickly.
"This is my brother-in-law, Harry." Ron said almost laughing.
After all the years of being introduced and referred to as Harry
Potter's best friend, he pointedly made it his goal to constantly
introduce Harry as a second character.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yes, Hermione told me about your
sister getting married, she was a bridesmaid, yes?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Terribly young if you ask me." she
commented as she stood, "Would you care for a cup of tea?"</p><p class="calibre7">the boys nodded absently as she left
the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"See I told you this was a bad idea.
'Terribly young'." Ron whispered furiously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron get a grip. Your older than me
and Ginny were. Are, whatever."</p><p class="calibre7">Ms. Granger reentered the room and
handed them their cups.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you. And well as far as age
goes, I just figured why delay the inevitable." Harry said calmly
as he stirred his tea.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, how terribly sweet." Ms.
Granger said holding a hand to her chest. "Your wife, and well I
guess sister. What is it that she does exactly."</p><p class="calibre7">"Qudditch." the boys answered
simultaneously, before laughing aloud.</p><p class="calibre7">"She plays for the only all female
Quidditch team." Harry answered after regaining his composure.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now, Quid-dicth, whats that? I don't
think Hermione ever mentioned that?"</p><p class="calibre7">"She wouldn't." Ron laughed.
"probably the only thing Hermione cant do."</p><p class="calibre7">Ms. Granger nodded. "Is it a sport?"
the boys nodded. "That would be it then, my Hermione, never been
one for sports." she starred off, reminiscing fondly.</p><p class="calibre7">Off in another room, a clock chimed and
caused her to check her watch. "Oh, dear. Look at that nearly five
already." she brushed the invisible crumbs of her skirt. "There
was something you need to ask me Ronald?" she asked looking at him
pointedly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron felt his mouth go dry. He took a
large sip of his tea before mumbling. "Um, oh yes. Yes, I need to
ask you, if well. You see." he tripped over his words again and
again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, just spit it out." harry
whispered from next to him.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron took a deep breath and looked back
at Ms. Granger. "I love Hermione more than anything. And even
through I might not be the best wizard, I really think I can make her
happy. And well, I would like to marry her." he finished and
quickly dropped his eyes back to his cup.</p><p class="calibre7">Mrs. Granger held her hand to her
chest. "Oh Ronald," she cried as she set her cup down and walked
to stand next to him. "Of course, you may. Oh I cant believe this,
I must call Hubert, he'll just be elated." she cried as she hugged
Ron tightly.</p><p class="calibre7">She quickly exited the room, and Harry
turned to Ron, "Hubert. Really?" Ron nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well mate, now all you have to do is
ask Hermione. Just hope shes not as bloody difficult as your sister."
Harry said sourly. "Had to wait for her to break her arm to ask
her."</p><p class="calibre7">"You could have asked her before
then, you just chose not to."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well thats besides the point."
Harry huffed, uncrossing his arms. "So when are you going to ask
her?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Ive got reservations tomorrow night
at that restaurant she likes. I figure that as good a place as any to
do it." he finished as Ms. Granger reentered the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hubert is delighted. He said to tell
you he is looking forward to you being his son-in-law." she smiled
sweetly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks,I um appreciate it?" Ron
said.</p><p class="calibre7">"So dear, when do you plan on asking
her? As soon as you do I'll need to get a hold of your Mum. Oh
goodness, planning a wedding! It will be so much fun." Harry
laughed internally as Ms. Granger rambled on about her excitement
over the planning. He looked at Ron, who was staring intently just
past Ms. Granger, a blank expression on his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ms. Granger," Harry interrupted
when she took a breath, <em class="calibre9">best treat this as a Hermione situation</em>,
"I hate to have to leave so soon, but I've got to be getting home,
Ginny should be back soon."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yes, I'm so sorry. Look at me
rambling on as if we had all day!" she stood and began leading them
towards the door. "Now, Ronald. You have Hermione call me as soon
as you propose, you hear?" Ron nodded and she gave him a hug before
they exited the house.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks mate." Ron said as the
reached then end of the walkway.</p><p class="calibre7">"anytime Ron, anytime."</p>
