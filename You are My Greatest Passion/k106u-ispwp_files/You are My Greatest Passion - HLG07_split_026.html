<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_27">*Chapter 26*: Chapter 26</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: OMG I messed up so bad! In earlier chapters I said that fleur was already prego, and well I just checked the timeline I had gotten before I started writing, and well it would have fleur being prego for like 2 years. Lol. Its great that I miss calculated, considering that I have a daughter right? Okay, well because of my floppy you get another chapter, yeah! Please review, and vote on the poll so that I know who to finish chapter Twenty-Eight! Thank you.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Voting on the smut poll=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">oh an a small smut warning...hehe</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twenty-six</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat in his office in the Auror department of the ministry. He looked at the folder on his desk. <em class="calibre9">Stupid kids </em>he thought<em class="calibre9">.</em> A few of them had gotten together and tried to conjure a dark mark. Fortunately, they did not have the spell right and only succeeded in turning their own skin a sickly green. Harry laughed a bit to himself. <em class="calibre9">I helped save the Wizarding world for this. </em>He looked around his office; it was fairly neat, due to it being so new, with only a few photos. He glance at the wall, on the left was a large group portrait of the Weasley family, himself and Hermione. The one next to it was he, Ron, Ginny and Hermione heading back from a Quidditch game in his sixth year. They all waved at the camera, and the photo Harry kept shooting glances at Ginny with a longing in his eyes. He moved his eyes the next and last picture in the wall. One of him and Ginny out by pond, every few seconds the photo Harry would give Ginny a light kiss on the lips.</p><p class="calibre7">He turned back to his desk, but it only provided more memories and grief, for on the corner of his desk sat another picture. This time Ginny alone. Every few moments the photo would turn and blush before laughing softly. He turned his face down to get away from the memories.</p><p class="calibre7">Two weeks later Ron stopped by the same office. He had barely seen Harry since he left the burrow, and today was Ginny's first game. Harry really needed to be there. He walked down the hall of Auror offices, finally coming to the one he was looking for. He took a deep breath and knocked on the door. A small "come in" sounded from the other side.</p><p class="calibre7">He walked into the small office, and sitting behind the desk was a clearly disheveled Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked up when Ron entered.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you doing here"? Shouldn't you be on your way to Ginny's match?"</p><p class="calibre7">"So you didn't forget about it." Ron stated.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, how could I." Harry sighed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you going to go?" Ron asked, maybe things could be patched up. He had not seen Ginny much since the fight, but what he had seen hadn't been good. She kept up appearances but it was almost as if she was dead behind the eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"How could I?" harry asked dejectedly. "She'd spear me alive if I showed up."</p><p class="calibre7">"How do you know? Maybe she really wants you there."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed again. "How did things go so wrong?" he leaned forward, placing his elbows on the desk. "I wish I could just go back and fix things."</p><p class="calibre7">"Mate, I don't really understand why you go so upset in the first place. I mean so what she made starting line. Do you really think she wouldn't want to marry you because of that?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know Ron. I just." He ran his hand through his hair. "I just don't want her to feel like I'm holding her back." He rested his head in his hands.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron stayed silent for a moment. "You know it's not too late. Just postpone proposing." Harry looked up horrified, and Ron motioned for him to stay quite. "just wait until she finishes the season. Then do it. Take things slow." Harry nodded. "You know it's not too late. Why don't you come to the game." Harry went to say something, and once again, Ron stopped him. "She sent a ticket to your office, I know she did. I was there when she sent the owl away."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry leaned back in his chair, before opening his top drawer and pulling out a white envelope. "Yeah I got them." He set it on his desk.</p><p class="calibre7">"So what are we waiting for?"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat nervously next to Ron in Kenmar stadium, watching Ginny fly around the stadium. He knew she had seen him, he was positive of it. Next to his feet sat a small of bundle of Calla Lilies that he had picked up before the game. He could tell the game was almost over, the Holyhead seeker had already almost caught the snitch twice and was currently right behind it. He bounced his leg, and Ron shot him a look of knowing.</p><p class="calibre7">Then it was over. It was over and now he was going to have to talk to Ginny, to apologize.</p><p class="calibre7">He watched her celebrate with the team on the field, and then as he sat there, almost paralyzed, she flew up to the box where he and Ron sat.</p><p class="calibre7">She stopped shortly to hug Ron, and Harry watched as Ron whispered something in her ear that they both laughed at, before turning to leave.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny began walking towards Harry and he stood carefully grabbing the lilies as he did so.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey," she said softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey," he said down casting his eyes. "I um brought you these." He held the flowers out to her and she took a step closer.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you," she said taking the flowers. She ran her finger over one of the soft petals. "Harry I've missed you."</p><p class="calibre7">He looked up for the first time to meet her eyes, and without hesitation, stepped forward and gathered her in his arms before kissing her passionately.</p><p class="calibre7">In the background he dimly registered flash bulbs flickering, but all he was concerned with was Ginny, and when she turned and apparated them into her dorm room, he did not protest.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br class="calibre6"/>They fell onto her small bed in the Holyhead players dorm, without breaking their embrace.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, I'm so sorry." He whispered as he removed his lips from hers.</p><p class="calibre7">She just nodded, as he pushed a stray hair out of her face. "I love you so much Ginny." He kissed her again softly.</p><p class="calibre7">They slowly undressed each other and spent time caressing each other in ways that they had overlooked in the past.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry kissed just below her brow line as he ran his hand up her side, they were cuddled under her blanket and had spent the last hour talking.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, why did you move out?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed. "I don't know Ginny, I was just going through something's. I can't really explain it."</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you think you're over it?" She asked quietly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'd like to think so."</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you going to move back in?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry thought for a minute, he would love to be back under the same roof as Ginny again, but there was part of him that said moving back in was a step in the wrong direction.</p><p class="calibre7">"I. I don't think so Gin." He finally answered moving so that he was lying on his back. Ginny curled up into his side and began tracing patterns on his bare chest.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why not? Don't you want to be with me?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry felt a pang at his heart as Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Of course I want to be with you Gin. It's just. I don't know." He sighed defeated. "I want to be with you Gin, but I can't move back into the Burrow."</p><p class="calibre7">"I guess I understand." Ginny said softly. "I just wish we could be together. You know I have a month off now."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really? That's great Ginny." Harry said kissing the top of her head and pulling her closer.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah. But with you not at the Burrow, and then working, when will I see you?" Ginny asked troubled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well you could hang out at my place; hey you could even fix it up for me." He laughed at the last part. "I have a bed and that's about it." Ginny looked up at him but did not say anything.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed, "Don't worry Gin, we'll figure something out."</p><p class="calibre7">They laid there for awhile just curled up around each other, Harry could tell that Ginny had fallen asleep by the way he breathing calmed, but for some reason he couldn't get himself to stop thinking. He knew there had to be away to stay at his new place but still make Ginny happy. Then he realized it.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly nudged Ginny awake. She proved to be almost as hard as waking Ron was, finally she stirred and opened her eyes slightly to look at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" she asked sleepily.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny I got it. I know how we can both be happy." She just stared at him and yawned in response.</p><p class="calibre7">"You should, you should move In with me." Harry finished, while tracing lines on the palm of Ginny's hand.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laid there for a minute and Harry worried that maybe she would not want to, but then she spoke. "What did you say? I think I might have fallen back asleep." Ginny turned her head up to face Harry, and he laughed. "I said you should move in with me." He laughed again and the worry that she would say no was apparent in it.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat up, pulling the blanket to cover her chest, "Harry are you serious?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No and yes." He laughed and she looked confused for a minute, before hitting him on the arm.</p><p class="calibre7">"Be serious for a moment please"</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you sure you want that gin?" Harry asked almost falling off the bed in his fit of laughter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," she whined. "Come on, did you really mean it? Do you want me to move in?" she asked unsure.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry took the hand that wasn't holding up the sheet and held it carefully. "Only if you want to."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled brightly before kissing Harry deeply. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pushed him back onto the bed. When she broke apart for a second, harry asked, "So can I take that as a yes?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed before attaching her lips to his again, Harry rolled them so that he was on top and pressing into her. Ginny moaned at the contact, and Harry moved his hand to her breast. He began kneading softly and running his thumb over the nipple just slightly. He pressed his hips harder against her and let out a low groan.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," Ginny breathed softly when he moved to suck on her neck. He made a low noise against her neck, and she took that as a sign to continue. "Harry, I think. I think I'm ready." Harry immediately stopped what he was doing and pulled back to look at her, his eyes wide.</p><p class="calibre7">"You mean ready for," his voice was higher than usual, and he looked down. "For that?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. Harry gulped.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Great okay, I can do this. Its every guys dream right</em>. Harry thought as he positioned himself above Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"You're positive about this?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Again, Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry took in a deep breath, he was about to push himself in, when the door opened and Ginny's dorm mate enter.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry dropped himself down onto Ginny to cover her body, and Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">The blonde girl finally looked over at the bed, and blushed when she saw the two, Ginny laughing madly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," she finally breathed. "This is my roommate, Brianna." She laughed again. "Brianna, this is Harry."</p><p class="calibre7">"Err nice to meet you." Harry said lamely. He quickly glanced around the room for his clothing,when he finally found them but they seemed to be just out of reach.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Damn my wands in my trouser pocket.</em> He looked down at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here take this," she handed him a small throw blanket off the bed. He carefully wrapped it around his waist and got out of bed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny called over to Brianna, who had been sitting on her bed, pointedly starring at the ceiling. They both looked at Harry, trying to grab his clothing while holding the small blanket around his waist, and laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shut it you two," Harry said as he looked at them angrily. "Ginny is there a washroom I can get dressed in?"</p><p class="calibre7">The two girls laughed again. "Yeah, down the hall. Thing is," she stopped and laughed again. "It's female only."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed. "So where am I supposed to get dressed?"</p><p class="calibre7">"It okay harry, you can dress in here. I'm sure the Prophet would pay loads for a description of Harry Potter's bits." Brianna said and the girls laughed again, before Ginny spoke up. "W.I.T.C.H. Weekly would probably pay more." They started laughing again, and Harry slammed down on Ginny bed, frustrated and still naked.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm just joking, harry." Brianna said as she gathered some wash things and clothes. "I'll see you later Ginny. Nice to meet you Harry." She walked out the door and down the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed quietly as she moved to sit behind Harry, she rubbed his shoulders softly before wrapping her arms around him. "we should get dressed."</p>
