			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Hey lookie another chapter! wow! Okay so now i get to rant right? Okay so Universal is opening a Harry Potter Theme Park at Universal Islands of Adventure in Orlando,Fl right?(like 25 mins away from me, hehe be jealous) but just found out they pushed the opening date back to 2010!

As he slowly eased himself in, he buried his face in her hair and slowly breathed in her scent. She smelled like strawberries, broomstick oil and...<em class="calibre9">Bacon</em>?</p><p class="calibre7">Harry opened his eye to find not Ginny below him, but the white cotton of his pillow. He rolled onto his back and looked down at himself; it was mornings like this that required long showers.</p><p class="calibre7">Twenty minutes later harry appeared at the bottom of the stair, showered and subdued for the moment. He peered into the dining room, everyone had finished eating already and moved on, except Ginny who sat at the table, her legs pulled up to her chest, with a book in her hand and absentmindedly chewing a piece of bacon. She looked up momentarily from her book when Harry entered the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Morning. Finally decide to join us?" she asked smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry mumbled something about female redheads before piling his plate.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm going to Diagon alley today" Ginny said without looking up.</p><p class="calibre7">"For what?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I need to get some Christmas presents."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh." Harry said as he buttered his toast, he furrowed his brow. He had not even thought of presents yet, and there was only another week until Christmas. "Do you mind if I tag along?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smile up at Harry "that'd be wonderful." she shoved the rest of her bacon in her mouth before hurrying up the stairs to get ready.</p><p class="calibre7">As they made their way down the snow covered streets in Diagon alley Ginny snuggled a bit closer to Harry's embrace. The wind whipped at her hair and the small knit cap she wore did nothing to keep the cold from her ears. "Let's go in here," she said pointing at a small shop. As they walked through the door, a small bell chimed. As Ginny walked further into the store. Harry paused at a case. Inside were no less than 20 forks, each with a different handle. <em class="calibre9">What is the difference? You just eat with them, what is the big deal about what they look like? </em>He pulled himself away from the forks and walked over to where Ginny was admiring a silver teakettle set.</p><p class="calibre7">"For your mum?" he asked walking up beside her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, no I could never afford something like that. I'm getting her this." she pulled up a simple ceramic kettle and showed it to him. "What do you think?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I like the silver." Harry replied.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, but what about this one" she said holding the small one at eye level.</p><p class="calibre7">"I still like the silver."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes." Ginny replied, trying to keep her patience. "But the silver would take all my money and I still have to get gifts for the rest of the family."</p><p class="calibre7">"How about we buy gifts together. That way I don't have to pick anything out, and you don't have to worry about money." Harry asked still looking at the silver kettle. "I really do like the silver better."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was lost for words. <em class="calibre9">Did he really just suggest we buy presents together? </em>She looked up at Harry. "Did you mean it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"What" Harry asked finally looking down at Ginny, a bit confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"About buying gift together."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, what's the problem?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing. It just that, well people usually don't buy presents together until there, well. You know "she finished lamely.</p><p class="calibre7">"What until their married?" Harry laughed. "Gin I don't think anyone's really going to mind. Besides were going to have to get used to it before too long." Harry finished quickly before grabbing the kettle and heading towards the register, leaving Ginny behind, mouth agape.</p><p class="calibre7">"What did you mean before too long?' Ginny stressed the word too as she followed Harry out into the cold street.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing much, just the obvious; what about a Irish Jersey for George?" he asked steering Ginny towards the Quidditch shop, and away from the conversation.</p><p class="calibre7">A few hours later, they sat in a back corner booth at The Leaky Cauldron finishing their lunches.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay so, we only have" Ginny slowly ran her finger down the list she had insisted on making earlier in the day. "My Dad and Ron. Oh and you said you wanted to get Teddy a few more things."</p><p class="calibre7">"How about we go into Muggle London to get him something, I think he'd really enjoy that. And I already have Ron's gift"</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay" Ginny smiled. She had only been into muggle London on a few occasions and those usually tended to be trips to or Kings Cross Station. "Are you ready?" she asked</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, we just got our food" he chuckled "can I finish eating first?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yeah sure." Ginny blushed as she picked up her own sandwich and took the first bite.</p><p class="calibre7">They finished eating, paid for their food and headed out the front entrance onto the cold London streets. Up ahead a small vendor was selling hot chocolate.</p><p class="calibre7">"Would you like a cup?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Sure harry." Ginny said as she rubbed her hands together to try and bring some warmth in.</p><p class="calibre7">"This could pose to be a problem," Harry said as he pulled his hand out of his pocket.</p><p class="calibre7">"what could?' Ginny asked as she looked at his hand, full of galleons and a few sickles.</p><p class="calibre7">"Were in muggle London." Harry whispered. Ginny looked at him confused for a minute before registering the meaning.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh. I guess we should go back to Gringotts then." She gave a small chuckle.</p><p class="calibre7">They turned to head back to the leaky cauldron, as they were walking a rather large man grabbed one of Harry shoulders.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, is that you?" Harry turned fully around to face the stranger.</p><p class="calibre7">"Dudley?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah. How are you? I mean I haven't seen you since, well since that day you left and they took us into hiding." He whispered the last part.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah" harry said running a hand through his hair. "A lot has happened since then." Harry gave a small chuckle before he heard the soft clearing of a throat behind him. "Oh yeah, I'm so sorry gin." He turned around and grabbed her hand. "Dudley, this is my girlfriend Ginny. Gin, this is my cousin Dudley."</p><p class="calibre7">"Nice to meet you, Harry's told us so much about you." Ginny replied with a bit of venom in her voice. Even though Harry had said all was forgiven between him and Dudley, she still remembered all the stories he had told her about him growing up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I'm sure." Dudley said with a sad smile. "You wouldn't happen to be related to the other red headed boys are you? The twins. You remember harry. They gave me that candy." He laughed a little.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gave a small nod. "That was Fred and George." Harry answered for her. "Her brothers. One of them, Fred, he was, Well killed in the war."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up, I didn't know."</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay. Like you said, you didn't know." Ginny gave him a reassuring smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey we should have dinner sometime. I could introduce you to the girl I've been seeing, I really think you'll like her."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, that sounds great. When do you want to do it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well how about you give me your number and I'll give you a call?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh well, see I'm staying with the Weasley's and they don't have a telly. I can send you an owl. Or would your mum still freak about that?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I'm not staying with mum anymore. Moved out right after we came out of hiding." He rolled his eyes. "Yeah an owl works. Here's my address" he handed harry a small card." I'll see you around " They shook hands and Dudley headed back out into the busy streets.</p><p class="calibre7">Later that evening they sat in Harry's room surrounded by gifts, Ginny currently fighting with a stubborn roll of tape, while Harry sat on the bed reading a magazine.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you think you could help me?" Ginny asked annoyed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I did help." Harry sated offended, pointing to the two packages he had "wrapped" one being her father's electronic shaver, and the other being Ron's season to tickets to the Chudley Cannons games.</p><p class="calibre7">"It doesn't count if the sale clerk wrapped it for you!"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well what about Ron's?"</p><p class="calibre7">"You put them in an envelope! How hard could that be?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well," he thought about his retort for a minute. "I put a bow on it too." he smirked to himself.</p><p class="calibre7">"Fine then." Ginny slammed her hands and went back to the tape.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry gave a small chuckle before sliding off the bed to sit behind her. He wrapped his arms around her and kissed her neck before whispering in her ear. "You know I was joking right?" she gave a small nod.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here let me see that." he took the tape and untangled it.</p><p class="calibre7">They spent the rest of the night wrapping presents and laughing.</p>
