			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Ah ha! a Sunday update! hehe. This ones fun! M for smut! hehe. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">So hope everyone had a great saturday, im exahusted! got home at 11:50 and my daughter decided to wake up at 7am this morning. ugh. not cool. but my girls did okay, top 15 out of 27 guards. There are some awesome shows this year. but yea, okay this is supposed to be harry potter fanfic not colorguard time....lol. READ AND REVIEW!!!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER:Jaime Kennedy's Circle circle dot dot=Hilariously Good(listen at ) Assuming i own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p class="calibre7">A few weeks later Harry spoke to Kingsley about the possibility of having his and Ginny's wedding at the muggle church where his parents were buried. Kingsley assured him it was completely possible as long as he received an invitation. Harry had laughed and assured him he was already on the list.</p><p class="calibre7">Now they were apparating out to Godric's Hollow to see if Ginny liked the church. Kingsley had agreed to accompany them to figure out the best way to conceal it and Molly came just because she could.</p><p class="calibre7">When they arrived in Godric's Hollow a light layer of snow covered the ground. They made their way into the center of town, and Ginny paused at the monument in the center. She did not say anything, just stared at it for moment before moving on. Everyone stayed silent as they walked through the small town towards the church.</p><p class="calibre7">When they reached the front steps, Ginny looked up. The afternoon light was reflecting off the stained glass windows, causing it to shoot mini-rainbows across the ground. Ginny gasped as she turned to Harry. "It's perfect." She whispered.</p><p class="calibre7">They slowly made their way inside and found the muggle minister.</p><p class="calibre7">"May I help you?" he asked in a timid voice, briefly glancing at Kingsley.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes," Ginny spoke up, her voice bright and hopeful. "We'd like to book your church for a wedding." She said bouncing on her heels.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry placed a hand on her shoulder to calm her.</p><p class="calibre7">The minister looked at them sadly for a moment before speaking, "I'm sorry miss, but we only book the church for residents."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny's face fell. She looked over at Harry, about to cry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Is there any way around that?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I don't know I'd have to ask the vicars." He thought for a moment. "May I ask the reason your set on this church?" he motioned to Ginny, but it was Harry who spoke.</p><p class="calibre7">"My parents are…" he stopped for a moment and cleared his throat, "their buried in the small cemetery out back." He said motioning towards the general direction of the graves.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, I see." He let out as he rocked on his heels a bit. "Well, I'll speak to the vicars as soon as I can." He placed a hand on Ginny's arm. "I'm sure they'll have no problem, seeing as how at one point your family were residents." He smiled sincerely before leading the out of the church.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't worry Gin, everything will work out." Harry said putting his arm around her shoulder. They walked around the square and Kingsley discussed options to keep the muggles away during the ceremony.</p><p class="calibre7">"I mean, you could be married by a muggle minister. It would still be legal in our world but it's just not the same."</p><p class="calibre7">"I understand. I want it done magically." Harry said as they continued walking. He was not paying attention to where his feet were heading and soon they found themselves on the small road that lead to his parent's house.</p><p class="calibre7">He drew in a deep breath as they reached the small gate, and pulled Ginny a bit closer as they looked at the rubble. He remembered seeing it that night with Hermione, but it was almost a completely different scene in the light. He lightly touched the gate and watched the small sign pop up.</p><p class="calibre7">He felt Ginny begin to sob next to him and squeezed her tightly. "I think it's time to go." Ginny nodded and they silently lead the way into the alley before apparating out of Godric's hollow.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br class="calibre6"/>"I think we may have to pick a different place for the reception." Ginny said over dinner a few days later.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah," Harry responded between bites, "why?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well because the muggle church is a little small, and my initial idea was to have an outdoor reception on your parents lot, but I never expected it to be in the condition it is." She said softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay Ginny, I've had almost two years to get used to the image."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and Harry continued. "How about we just do the reception at the Burrow. That'll make your Mum real happy."</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you think people will like the idea of apparating from one place to another?"</p><p class="calibre7">"If they don't like it don't come." Harry said plainly, as he took another bite.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry we have to pick one. They have to go out no later than Thursday." Ginny said exasperated.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I don't know which one I like. Why don't you just pick?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Because it's your wedding too."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, well then I like…" he closed his eyes and ran his hand over the invitations. "This one." He said picking on up at random.</p><p class="calibre7">"Fine." Ginny said as she looked at his selection. She tried to be upset, but somehow in his stupid little game he had picked the one she had wanted all along.</p><p class="calibre7">They paid the cashier and went back to their flat.</p><p class="calibre7">"So any other plans for today?" Harry asked as they walked through the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nope, nothing. Tomorrow however…" she started but Harry cut her off.</p><p class="calibre7">"Tell me about tomorrow's plans, tomorrow. For now if were done I just want to relax." He said as he slipped off his robes and sat on the bed. He laid back and let out a groan.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you okay?" Ginny asked as she hung up her robes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah fine. My backs just sore." He said trying to rubbing it a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">"Would you like me to do that?" she asked as she climbed onto the bed and crawled towards him.</p><p class="calibre7">"If you like," He said as Ginny slowly slipped his shirt above his head and began massaging his lower back.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh," Harry moaned as she kneaded one of the knots out. "That feels great."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny felt herself becoming oddly turned on as she rubbed his bare back. She let her fingers linger as she trailed them up to his shoulder blades. She rubbed at them and he let out another moan, almost causing her to lose control. After she finished with his shoulders, she reluctantly let her hands fall.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry turned to face her. "That was bloody brilliant." He smiled and made to pick up his shirt.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do me?" Ginny asked, quickly grabbing his hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sure Gin." He sat back down on the bed and his eyes widened when Ginny removed her shirt. She laid face down on the bed and cross her arms above her head.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry gulped before moving to kneel above her. He awkwardly massaged her back. His hands much too large to do a proper job on her petite body.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny let out a small moan, it was not really from the pleasure of the massage but more from the fact that Harry was touching her. She smiled to herself when she felt him hardening against her rear. She shifted just a little bit to brush against it with her bum, and Harry sat up rigidly, before going back to her shoulders. He let his hands trail softly down her back until he met her bra strap. He gently but quickly undid the clasp and moved it out of his way. He trailed his hands down to her lower back just above her waistband. He rubbed slowly and she uttered another soft moan.</p><p class="calibre7">He could not take it anymore, he leaned forward and planted a kiss on her bare shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," he whispered in her ear, but she could hear the desire behind it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh huh?" she answered breathlessly.</p><p class="calibre7">He did not respond. He only acted.</p><p class="calibre7">He quickly flipped her over so that she was facing him and removed her bra the rest of the way.</p><p class="calibre7">He reached down and unbuttoned her jeans before pulling them off her. He sucked on her hip a bit before moving up to kiss her.</p><p class="calibre7">The kiss was rough and sloppy, but Ginny did not care. She tangled her hand in his hair as he continued assaulting her mouth with his tongue.</p><p class="calibre7">She pulled back after a moment and reached down to undo his trousers only to find them, along with his boxers, already gone.</p><p class="calibre7">"When'd you do that?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"While you were pulling my hair," he replied in between planting kisses on her neck.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," she moaned he began to pull at her knickers. She heard a small ripping sound but was too far gone to register what it was.</p><p class="calibre7">They paused for a moment and Ginny quickly pulled one of the pink vials from her bedside table. <em class="calibre9">Damn, I am running low. I will have to brew some more.</em> She thought in the back of her head.</p><p class="calibre7">Once she had drained the liquid and disposed of the container, Harry wrapped his arms around her and roughly thrust into her. He let out a deep moan as he first felt her enveloping him. He began to slowly rock in and out of her, holding her to him tightly.</p><p class="calibre7">She began panting beneath him and he kneeled back to look at her. She was beautiful to him, her hair drenched in sweat and her face flushed. He grabbed her leg and wrapped it around his waist as he pushed deeper into her. He stayed up right looking down at her as she closed her eyes and let her head drop back. He gripped her hips and pushed harder into her. He felt himself coming lose and soon he pulled Ginny's other leg up so that they were both around his waist. He leaned forward, and pressed his body against her as he thrust. He watched as Ginny moaned beneath him, he let his head fall back and pumped himself into her.</p><p class="calibre7">After his release, he moved inside of her a few more time, guaranteeing that she came to hers as well. When he was sure she was finished, he collapsed on top of her. Panting and covered in sweat, before falling into a deep sleep.</p><p class="calibre7">They woke up a few hours later. Or at least Ginny did, she pushed slightly at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just groaned in his sleep. "Harry get off me, your crushing me."</p><p class="calibre7">"Huh, what?" he asked rubbing his eyes. "Oh gin, I'm sorry," he said as he rolled off her and grabbed his glasses.</p><p class="calibre7">She got off the bed slowly, "Have you seen my knickers?' she asked bending to lift a few clothes from the floor.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I think I threw them," He thought for a moment. "In that general direction." He said pointing.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny walked over a picked up a ripped piece of lace. "Harry, look what you did." She said holding up what used to be her knickers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sorry?" he asked getting ready.</p><p class="calibre7">She just laughed at him as she deposited them in the trashcan and went to the closet to get dressed.</p>
