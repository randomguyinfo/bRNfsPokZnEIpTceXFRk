			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Wow uber proud of myself. usually i wont post chapters until i have atleast one more written, like to poster 22 id have to have 23 done. well guess what today,idk the writting bug hit me because im bout to start 25. yep 25, wanna know what happens? haha im not telling. hehe. okay okay, they all die. j/k(thats what my hubby tells ppl when they ask how somethings ends,lol) okay well review.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Godiva=GOOD Assuming i own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter twenty-two</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stood at the apparition point at the burrow, his travel bags next to him and Ginny in his arms.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know you'll be remarkable. Owl me when they accept you."</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry stop it." Ginny laughed at she playfully hit his chest. "You're going to jinx me." She laid her head back on his chest. "I'm going to miss you." She whispered.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay; I'll be back before you know it." He held her a little closer. "And beside you're leaving in less than a week. Then I'll be here when you get back."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny weakly nodded and snuggled closer into his chest.</p><p class="calibre7">They small alarm on Harry's watch chimed, causing him to look down at it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, I've got to go. I'll be late." She nodded and he lifted her chin up to look her in the eyes. He lowered his head and placed a gentle kiss on her lips.</p><p class="calibre7">He pulled away after a moment. "I love you Ginny." And with that, he turned and disappeared.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Week passed and Ginny was preparing to leave for try-outs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum, have you seen my gloves?' she yelled from her room. <em class="calibre9">Why can't I ever keep track of things when I really need them? </em></p><p class="calibre7">She emptied another drawer onto the floor and began rummaging through its contents. <em class="calibre9">Stupid gloves.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear," Molly yelled from downstairs. "I have your gloves, and an owl just arrived for you."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny pushed the items aside and bound down the stairs. Molly held out the gloves and Ginny shoved them in her already full bag. "You said there was an owl for me?" Ginny asked looking around the kitchen for a letter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes dear," Molly said, not looking up from the vegetables she was cutting, "He left the box on the back porch."</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Who would send me a package?</em> Ginny wandered as she made her way through the door and onto the back porch.</p><p class="calibre7">There sat an oversized package, she plucked the note off the box and began to read.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny,</p><p class="calibre7">Auror Camp is so much fun. Absolutely love it. Waking up at five and not getting a break until two. Awesome. Can you feel my sarcasm? Oh well hope this gets to you before you leave, I wish I was there to see you off. When you open this, don't be upset with me. I just thought you deserved the best. I love you and cannot wait to see you again.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">What the hell could be in the box that he would be afraid of me getting upset about? </em>She walked over and slowly undid the wrapping on the box. The outside package told that it had come from Quality Quidditch supplies, but gave no other clues. She slowly opened the box to see what was inside.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron was upstairs napping. He had already told Ginny good-bye and figured he was in the clear for a nice long snooze. That was until there was a shriek from outside. Ron jumped up in his bed, grabbed his wand and hurried down the stairs. He made it the back door at the same time Mrs. Weasley was exiting the house. They stood at the backdoor staring curiously at the source of the noise. A very excited Ginny bouncing up and down clutching what looked like a new broom.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny what the hell?" Ron asked sleepily.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ronald language, Ginny dear, did you really need to scream so loudly?'</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes Mum. Do you know what this is?" she asked as if the answer was obvious.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's a broomstick dear." Mrs. Weasley answered annoyed. Ginny just looked offended.</p><p class="calibre7">"It is not just a broom mother," Ginny said appalled. "It's the newest broom out. Only the major leagues even have them yet." Ginny beamed proudly. "Harry got it for me for my try-out." She added at the last minute.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh well then you're sure to do fine," Molly said looking at the clock in the kitchen, "but I'm afraid if you don't leave now you'll be late."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny peaked at the clock and gave a small shriek. She quickly shouldered her bag, gave her Mum and brother a quick hug before gathering her broom and running for the apparition point."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">When Ginny arrived at Holyhead stadium, she quickly surveyed the area around her. She had never seen so many female quittidch players in her life. Everyone around her was talking and making their way into the stadium to take seats.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny found a seat towards the front just as the clock on top of the announcer box hit twelve. A woman dressed in green robes stepped up to a box in the middle of the field. She held her wand to her throat and motioned for silence.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now that it has reached twelve, we have placed anti-apparation charms on the area. Here at Holyhead we take being on time very seriously." She looked around at the gathered witches. "I would like to welcome you all to the seven hundred and ninety sixth season of the Holyhead Harpies auditions." There was a loud roar of applause from the gathered candidates. "I wish you all the best of luck. Now if you will listen carefully, we are going to divide you into what position you play. Keepers to the far left of the field…" she proceeded to call of the specific areas where they were to separate.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">It was the end of the day and Ginny was drenched in sweat. Her hair was tangled and she had never been so tired in her entire life. Concisely, she had never felt better. She smiled brightly as the rest of the Chaser candidates made their way back into the stadium seats, they were about to announce who was invited back for day two of the auditions and Ginny was excited and nervous at the same time. She listened intently as they read of the names. "Lauren Buckfields…" a few more names pasted, Ginny counted on her fingers, they were only bringing twenty of the hundred and two chasers back for tomorrow, and already they had called seventeen names. "Brianna Smithfield…" two more names. "Clarissa Vale…" one more, Ginny crossed her fingers and shut her eyes. "Ginevra Weasley." Ginny looked up. "No one calls me Ginevra." She said sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">Then it hit her. <em class="calibre9">Oh, Ginevra Weasley </em>she bounced up in down in her seat, and finally had to make herself pay attention to what the announcer was saying. "Thank you to all those who took the time to try-out, we appreciate your effort. Unfortunately…" <em class="calibre9">I made second day, I made second day </em>Ginny chanted over and over in her head. "Tomorrow…" W<em class="calibre9">hoops.</em> <em class="calibre9">Okay time to pay attention.</em> "we meet at 7, on the pitch, wear your practice gear." She pointed to a small table at the entrance of the dressing rooms. "There you can find information on where you will be staying tonight. Lights out at 9."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br class="calibre6"/>Ginny made her way into the small room she had been assigned for the fifth night. It had just been announced that she was a candidate to stay for the final day of auditions and she was exhausted. She dropped onto her bed. She looked over at the other bed in the room, she had been lucky. She had only had to deal with a roommate for two nights. She slowly got off the bed and made her way into the bathroom, determined to have a nice long bath.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny once again sat in the Holyhead stands. Next to her were only four other girls. Tonight was the last day of try-outs. Two people would be awarded spots on the reserve team, with a chance to move up onto first string, and three would go home empty handed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny bounced her left leg relentlessly. She had never been so nervous. She did not know what she would do if she did not get this. Yeah she had done fine in school, and could probably go work at , or in some random Ministry department. However, she did not want to, she wanted to do something fun with her life, and that was Quidditch.</p><p class="calibre7">Her stomach put itself into a new knot as the announcer made her way to the center box. This time they had gathered all the candidates, not just one section at a time.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay ladies. It has been a long journey, and because you are sitting here means that you are a remarkable Quidditch player. If you are not selected, it just means that you are not right for Holyhead at the present time." She smiled sweetly at the bunch of nervous witches. "Well onto the announcements. As Reserve Keeper, Madelyn Louis." The girl who was obviously Madelyn jumped up from her seat and made her way onto the field. The rest of the women in the keeper section looked on disappointed and a few looked as if they were actually going to cry. Ginny looked on as the Beaters were announced. "Abigail McNath and Nicole Yemini. And now for our Chasers…" Ginny began wringing her hands together, <em class="calibre9">if you do not get it whatever you do; do not cry </em>she told herself. "Brianna Smithfield…" <em class="calibre9">Okay she was really good, oh my go what if I don't get it.</em> "…And Ginevra Weasley!" Ginny jumped up after Brianna and the two girls wrapped each other in a tight hug before making their way to the field. She heard them announce the reserve seeker, but didn't pay any attention; she was too preoccupied by her elation. <em class="calibre9">Oh, my I cannot wait to tell Harry he's going to be so happy.</em></p><p class="calibre7">She followed the rest of the reserve players into the stadium and up to the offices.</p><p class="calibre7">After the contracts were signed and her bag was packed, Ginny headed back to the apparition point.</p><p class="calibre7">She arrived at the burrow a moment later, her broom in one hand and her practice schedule in the other.</p>
