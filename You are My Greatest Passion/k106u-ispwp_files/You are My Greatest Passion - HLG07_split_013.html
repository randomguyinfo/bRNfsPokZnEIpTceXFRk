<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_14">*Chapter 13*: Chapter 13</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: If you thought Seamus was irritating in the last chapter. lol. I hope you enjoy it. Review! lol. p.s. i dont own Harry Potter.</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirteen</p><p class="calibre7">Soon the weather turned cold and a soft blanket of snow covered the grounds of Hogwarts. Hermione wrapped her scarf a little tighter around her neck and checked her watch. <em class="calibre9">8 am gods where are they. </em>She had been waiting for almost a half hour for Harry, Ron and Ginny in Hogsmead. She crossed her arms and impatiently tapped her foot. Finally on the road from Hogwarts emerged the silhouettes of three people, as they neared she recognized them as her two best friends and boyfriend.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where have you been?" she said in a voice the eerily reminded them of Mrs. Weasley. Harry just gapped for words under the wrath of Hermione while Ron yawned and Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sorry some of us" she pointed a thumb at Ron "had a little trouble waking this morning." Hermione dropped her arms and smiled at Ginny before pulling her into a hug. "I've missed you guys so much!" she pulled Harry into a hug before she looked up at Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ronald"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah?" he yawned.</p><p class="calibre7">"You haven't seen me in months and that's all you can say?" she asked angrily while placing her hands on her hips.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron looked puzzled for a minute before answering "ummâ€¦no?" Hermione swatted him playfully on the arm before pulling him into a deep kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">"So what should we do first?"</p><p class="calibre7">Hours later the quartet sat in the Three Broomsticks nursing their butterbeers and munching on a plate of chips.</p><p class="calibre7">"Working at the Ministry is amazing" Hermione gushed. "Of course I'm only entry level but to see them rebuilding it from the inside! It just takes my breath away."</p><p class="calibre7">"So what department are you working in?" Ginny managed to get in.</p><p class="calibre7">"Magical and Muggle cooperation." she said with a sigh. "But I'm hoping to get into the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures Department after I finish my training. That way I can further my efforts for SPEW." Ron stifled a groan.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wow that's amazing Hermione" Ginny offered before taking another chip.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione then turned her attention to the boys. "So how are classes going? Are you two studying enough?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron and Harry looked at each other guiltily. Neither of them had really been studying at all. Harry though now was a good time to leave.</p><p class="calibre7">"Um-Ginny didn't you have to get some new quills?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, but that can wa-" she stopped short when she saw the pleading look in his eyes. "Oh yes! We better be heading off." she gathered her bag and gave Hermione a hug before she and Harry headed out into the busy street. Harry laughed and wrapped his arm around her waist.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you so much. She'd hound me for hours if she knew I wasn't studying."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed into her gloved hand before pulling him towards Scrivenshaft's.</p><p class="calibre7">After Ginny had made all of her purchases and they were wrapped up in their scarves, once again they headed back out into the cold.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where to now" Ginny asked cuddling into the side of Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Let's head back up to the castle"</p><p class="calibre7">"Why I thought we were going to meet up with Ron and Hermione again"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, but I really don't feel like being badgered about my homework habits right now, or worse catching them snogging." He gave a small disgusted face.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gave a small laugh and they began walking towards the castle and up to the Gryffindor common room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Whoa seems like everyone had the same idea." Ginny said over the noise as they entered the room. It seemed that everyone in Gryffindor house was currently residing in the common room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on lets head upstairs, I kind of just want to be alone with you right now." Harry took her hand and led her through the madness and up the stairs to the seventh year's room. As they entered the room Harry slid off his gloves, scarf, and kicked off his shoes before dropping down on his bed. He looked intently at Ginny who remained in the doorway and raised his eyebrows suggestively. Ginny let out a chuckle before moving towards the bed and kicking off her shoes. She sat down on the edge of the bed and with a deliberate slowness removed her gloves and scarf. She began to slowly fold the scarf, when she went to set it on the table was when Harry lost his patience. He reached across the bed and dragged her onto her back while hovering slightly above her. He looked deep into her eyes and smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you Ginny." he slowly lowered his head and gently kissed her, he began to slowly trail kisses along her jaw line and down her neck. Ginny let out a low moan and ran her hands up Harry's back and across his shoulders. She then let her hands find their way to Harry's waistband and began to tug on his shirt, once free she let one hand linger softly on his back while letting the other one tangle in his hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry" she moaned "what if someone comes in? Do we really need a repeat?" she tittered. Harry pushed himself up off the bed and pulled the dressings closed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Better?' he said smiling down at her. She smiled up at him before slowly reaching for the buttons of his shirt. As she carefully released each button from its holding, she was taken once again with the marvel that was Harry. She let her eyes linger on his chest before looking him in the eyes. "Harry I love you so much."</p><p class="calibre7">"I know Gin, I love you too." he reached down a placed a soft hand on the side of her face and gave her a gentle kiss before letting his fingers trail their way to the hem of her jumper. He slowly inched it up her body and over her head before tossing it to the floor. Ginny pushed his shirt back on his shoulders and down his arms, she let her fingers linger on his shoulders before dropping it to the floor. She sat up on her knees and pushed herself close against him. Wrapping her arms around his neck, she fervently began to kiss him. After several heated moments, he felt her hands trailing down his bare chest and towards his belt buckle. Harry sucked in his breath when she removed the soft leather from its metal confine and advanced towards his button. When all was free and done she slowly tugged on the loose denim. Harry swung his legs over and pulled the jeans completely off. He turned back towards her with such a longing in his eyes it sent shivers through her body. He slowly pushed her down onto the pillows and let his hands trail down the sides of her body. He paused at her waistband, he rubbed the area where her smooth skin stopped and was met by the rough denim. He slid his hand together over the clasp of her jeans and slowly pulled the button from its holding. He held his breath as he slowly undid the zipper. Even though he had lain in bed, near naked, with Ginny before. It had been dark then and he had not been able to truly appreciate her. He gently eased the jeans down her hips and off her legs. He sat back on his haunches and starred down at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry what are you looking at" Ginny questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">He was shocked out of his trance. "Huh? Oh, uh nothing it's just that." he swallowed hard. "You're just so beautiful."</p><p class="calibre7">A deep blush slowly began to form on Ginny's face and ever so slowly began to cover her body as she shyly looked up at Harry. "You've got to stop saying that. You're going to give me a complex."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled at her before he leaned down and kissed her, letting his hands wander everywhere at once. After several heated minutes, he felt as if his brain quit working, he forced himself to see reason but it was increasingly difficult with each passing moment as Ginny lay beneath him moaning his name and withering against him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny" he heard himself call "Gin, will you. Will you touch me?" he asked as he grabbed her wrist and lead it towards himself.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked Harry in the eyes, he had to be kidding, <em class="calibre9">no there it is, the spark of desire</em>. She swallowed deeply before nodding. She did not exactly know what she was agreeing to but she had a feeling she was about to find out. She watched as Harry slipped off his boxers and turned his attention back to her. He smiled sheepishly at her before moving to kiss her. She let her hands trail over his chest before plucking up the courage to go any farther south, when she did Harry sucked in a sharp breath. He lay back on the bed and pulled Ginny next to him, never breaking their kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry" Ginny breathed as she broke away. "Show me what to do." Harry simple nodded at her before leading her hand down and showing her the up-down motion. Ginny watched as Harry's hand moved over hers and his breathing quickened. He moved his hand away from hers and she figured she must have been doing all right then.</p><p class="calibre7">She watched as he clutched the sheets tightly in his fist and felt as he began to throb under her. Even though she knew theoretically what was going to happen it still didn't help to prepare her any more when it happened. The smooth skin in her hand began to harden even more and throb erratically before a slew of warm white liquid shot from the top. Ginny shot her hand back but it was already too late. Her hand was covered in the sticky substance. She looked down at Harry, laying on the bed a calm, relaxed look on his face accompanied by a small smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin," he spoke softly. "That was amazing."</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, yeah. Sure" she said looking disgustedly down at her hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"What's wrong?" Harry asked sitting up and finally opening his eyes. He followed the trail of her eyes to her hand and let out a small chuckle. "Oh. Sorry about that." he reached out of the bed dressings, grabbed his wand, and preformed a cleansing charm on Ginny's hand.</p><p class="calibre7">She murmured a small thanks in response still looking at her hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, if you're not okay with this I won't ever ask you to do it again." Harry said sincerely.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, it ok. It's just that I wasn't really expecting It." she blushed slightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh. Well next time I'll try to give you a little warning." he smiled at her before giving her a quick kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on let's get dressed and head down to the Great Hall from some dinner." she nodded as he reached down next to his bed to retrieve their clothing only to find the floor bare. He looked down-nothing. He poked his head out of the dressings and looked towards the ground. <em class="calibre9">Where the hell did they go? </em>He was about to get worried when he heard the all too familiar snickering. He looked over to the next bed to see Seamus sitting there, with his and Ginny's clothes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Looking for these?" he laughed while gesturing at the pile of clothing.</p><p class="calibre7">"Err, yes" Harry answered hoping Seamus wouldn't drag this out to long. "can you give them to me?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Now where's the fun in that Potter? Nah I think I'll set them over here." he walked to the far side of the room and set the clothes on the bed. "now it gets really fun" he smiled mischievously, making Harry wonder what he was up to before Seamus yelled out "Oi Ron" Harry's eyes widened. "Potter wants you." Seamus broke down in hysterics as Harry difficulty managed to cover himself with a pillow and dash across the room to retrieve his and Ginny's clothing. He was able to just make it back to bed and dive under the covers with Ginny before Ron came into the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you hollering about Finnagin?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah, nothing Potter just wanted to see you that's all." he bit back his laughter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry?' Ron walked over to Harry's bedside where the drapes were still closed.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry did not respond and hoped Ron would assume he was asleep and just go away.</p><p class="calibre7">Unfortunately, Harry was never that lucky. Ron gripped the drapes and pulled them back reveling a frazzled Harry and Ginny frantically trying to sort through their clothing.</p><p class="calibre7">"Um hello Ron." Ginny attempted in an innocent tone of voice.</p><p class="calibre7">Seamus broke down in laughter and could be heard falling from the bed he had been sitting on.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron, trying his best to ignore his sisters near naked state, turned to Harry. "Um, Seamus said you wanted me?" Ron by now had figured out that Harry probably had not intended for Ron to come up to the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, no offence Ron, but no. not really" Harry tried to smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh. Well I'm just going to head down to dinner." he turned to walk away.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron!" Ginny called, he slowly turned back to her. "If you wait, outside that is, for a minute we were just about to head down. " Ron nodded and headed out of the dorm.</p><p class="calibre7">Seamus who by this time had picked himself up off the floor looked disappointed. "Well that didn't go as I planned."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes and you're lucky it didn't." Ginny shot at him. "You're lucky I don't hex your bits off!"</p><p class="calibre7">Seamus quickly grabbed himself with a pained expression and made his way quickly out of the room. Harry and Ginny dressed quickly in a companionable silence before going to meet Ron and heading down to dinner.</p>
