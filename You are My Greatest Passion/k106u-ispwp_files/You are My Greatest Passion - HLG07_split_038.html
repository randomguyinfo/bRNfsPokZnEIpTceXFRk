			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Victories name and meaning, not mine, JRK.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Ha-ha went to the opening Gasparilla parade last night. Awesome. Then valentine's day is the knight parade, gonna go party on 7</strong><strong class="calibre4">th</strong><strong class="calibre4"> Ave in Ybor...

Lol) 3) A Mustang Convertible</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Things I do not own…1) my husband's military contract 2) a 36" King Saber 3) Harry Potter</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty-Eight</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stayed silent as they made their way back towards muggle London. Truth be told she had never understood her Father's love for muggle things, but she had to admit, the car was nice. She especially liked how with the side windows down and the top one opened it almost felt like flying. Almost.</p><p class="calibre7">She stared out at the fields as they passed. That was one negative about apparating. You could get places fast, but you missed out on so much detail.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your parents live just over that way." Harry spoke up, motioning towards the east.</p><p class="calibre7">"Could we stop for a bit?" Ginny asked excitedly. Her father would have a field day just looking at the car.</p><p class="calibre7">"I guess we could, but we'll be getting back to London real late. Your Mum may just persuade us into staying." He laughed as he made a left turn.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny watched excitedly as familiar sights came into view. She could recognize the houses on the outskirts of the village and soon they were passing the ice cream shop she and Ron had visited every summer when they were little.</p><p class="calibre7">When they passed through the town and the landscape grew a bit hillier she excitedly bounced in her seat.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, you're shaking the car." Harry laughed, placing a calming hand on her leg.</p><p class="calibre7">They pulled up right by the back door and Ginny could see her Mum peering out the back door suspiciously.</p><p class="calibre7">With a laugh, she released the belt and got out of the car. "Mum!" she called and Molly opened the door a bit more. "Come look."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly slowly made her way down the back steps and over to where Ginny stood.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well Harry dear this is lovely." She said looking reservedly at the car. "I don't see why you would need to buy one, with apparition and the floo but…" she trailed off when she heard Arthur coming up behind her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," he said excitedly. Ginny could tell he was hoping to get a good look at the vehicle.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just laughed, "Would you like to go for a drive?" he asked and Arthur nodded vehemently. "You can even drive." Harry said tossing the keys.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed as her Father nearly ran to the driver side, he looked like Teddy on Christmas morning.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on Ginny dear. You can give me a hand finishing supper." Molly said turning to head back into the house.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm glad to see you're not upset with Harry," Molly said conversationally as the cut up vegetables for that nights stew. "He really didn't do anything wrong." Molly smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know," Ginny sighed. "I'm just so stressed out, and every little thing seems to set me off." She dumped the carrots into the pot.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's normal." Molly said calmly. "And just remember, in a week it will be over with and you'll never have to worry about planning your wedding again." She placed her chopped up vegetables in the pot and wiped her hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"I found my wedding dress the other day in the attic. Would you care to see it while the boys are gone?"</p><p class="calibre7">"That'd be wonderful Mum."</p><p class="calibre7">When Arthur and Harry arrived back, the women were sitting in the family room looking at Molly's wedding album. "Mum you were so thin." Ginny exclaimed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, well seven children can pack on some extra baggage." Molly laughed goodheartedly. "Are you ready for supper?" she asked when Arthur came over to peer at the book.</p><p class="calibre7">"Only if you're done here dear."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, I think we are." She gave Ginny a light squeeze on the shoulder before leading Arthur into the kitchen to serve the stew.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry tentatively took Molly's place next to Ginny. He looked down at the picture.</p><p class="calibre7">A much younger version of Molly and Arthur stood in dress robe waving back at them. "Do you think we'll be as happy as they are?" he asked arbitrarily.</p><p class="calibre7">"I would like to think so…" she said as she trailed a finger across the lace on the page.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry reached over and gave her a soft kiss. "Come on let's get something to eat."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and gave the picture one last look before letting Harry wrap his arm around her waist and lead her into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry it's getting quite late, how long did you say the drive back into London was?" Molly asked as she cleared the table.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry let out a small yawn, "About two hours, but that's without traffic." He scowled. <em class="calibre9">One bad thing about muggle transportation.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"Well that puts you getting back, at the earliest," she glanced at the clock. "One-AM? No we can't have that," she said as she sat the dishes to wash themselves. "You'll just have to bunk here for the night."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shot Ginny an I-TOLD-YOU-SO look and she hid a smile. "Okay Mum."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes," Molly repeated. "Too late. Which reminds me, Arthur what time do we have to be at Bills tomorrow?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I think he said 7 would be fine."</p><p class="calibre7">"Am or pm."</p><p class="calibre7">"I think am." Arthur said folding his paper neatly. "Well it's time I got to sleep." He yawned slightly. "See you in the morning."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I think I'm going to get to bed too, been a long day." Ginny said getting up from her chair.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry routinely got up from his chair and began to follow her, as he slowly followed her up the stairs a though hit him <em class="calibre9">am I supposed to go to her room? I mean they know we sleep together at the flat but…</em> he registered the footfalls behind him as Molly. <em class="calibre9">Great. </em>They reached the landing in front of Ginny's room. She quickly entered and left the door opened, apparently meaning for Harry to follow.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry glance at the open door, over to Percy's room across from it, then finally at Molly. She had a masked expression on her face and he could not tell if she was going to be upset or not.</p><p class="calibre7">He shifted his feet uncomfortably. Taking a deep breath, he said a quick good night and ducked into Ginny's room, closing the door tightly behind him.</p><p class="calibre7">He leaned his head back on the cool wood and let out a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny let out a giggle from across the room. "I thought your Mum was going to murder me." He said as he slowly opened his eyes and began heading for the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"She wouldn't do that." Ginny assured. "She's put too much into planning our wedding." She laughed as she sat up on her knees, bouncing slightly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just watched her silently. She was beautiful, the way her hair bounced and her…</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry?" Ginny repeated herself. She snapped her fingers in front of her face.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up befuddled. "Yes?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny let out a small laugh, "I asked if you were coming to bed."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah… I suppose." He went to lift off his shirt but stopped. "I wish I would have thought to bring night clothes."</p><p class="calibre7">"You'll survive," Ginny smirked walking over to her closet. She pulled out a faded pair of bottoms and a small top. She looked at them appraisingly. "Well, better than nothing." She quickly changed and got back under the covers. Harry just stood there. "You're not seriously thinking of sleeping in your jeans, are you?" She asked humor present in her voice.</p><p class="calibre7">"No I guess not," Harry said looking down. He quickly stripped and moved into the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Geez Gin," he pulled on the blanket. "Come on, I'm cold." He whined.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well," Ginny laughed. "You should have thought about that before." She laughed. "I'm sure if you ask my Mum she can find you some night clothes."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry thought about the prospect of waking Molly. "Nah, I'll survive." He said resolutely. "You'll just have to keep me warm," he said wrapping his arms and legs around her and burring his face in her neck.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry…" she squealed pushing at him.</p><p class="calibre7">He moved to pin her beneath him and began kissing at her neck. She slowly sunk into it and when he released her hands, she wrapped them around his neck and pulled him closer rather than pushing him away. He kissed her lightly on the lips before looking down at her curiously.</p><p class="calibre7">"No," Ginny replied. "Harry I know that look and the answer is no."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry's face dropped immediately. "Why not?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because for one were in my parents' house."</p><p class="calibre7">"I know," Harry replied cheekily. "That's part of the fun," he said as he reached under her top to caress the underside of her breast.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry focus." Ginny said grabbing his face, and pulling it so that he was looking her straight in the eye. "And secondly, you know that great little pink potion that I keep in my nightstand."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"The one that insures that it's just the two of us for a little while longer."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded again, smiling this time.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well it's still there." Harry's face fell into confusion.</p><p class="calibre7">"In my nightstand. Thus not here."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Harry said disappointed, he was really enjoying the thought of doing it in Ginny's old bed. Or doing it at all. "Hey," he jumped startling Ginny. "I bet your Mum has some in her potions cupboard." He laughed haughtily. "All you have to do is sneak down there and find it." He sat back and looked at Ginny, a proud look of confidence on his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"You seriously expect me to sneak down into my Mother's cupboard and steal a potion, just so that you can get some?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded vehemently.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you going to let me get good nights sleep if I don't?" she asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry pondered the question for a moment. "Not likely." He responded finally.</p><p class="calibre7">With a huff, Ginny lifted herself from the bed and made her way to the door. "You better appreciate this Potter." She shot at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I do." He said as he watched her exit the room.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny silently made her way down the stairs, mindful of the creaking one, and into the kitchen. The light was dimmed and she could barely see, but she did not want to chance waking her parents by turning on the light; that and she had left her wand in her room.</p><p class="calibre7">She made her way over to her Mother's cabinet and opened the door slowly. She carefully sorted through the bottles, being careful not to undo their organizational system. She was beginning to get frustrated and was about to give up. She lifted a small vial to her eye line. "Is that pink or red, I can't tell?" she asked quietly to herself.</p><p class="calibre7">Unfortunately, someone else answered. "That would be red dear."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nearly dropped the vial as she spun around to face her mother, who was calmly sitting at the kitchen table, sipping a cup of tea. "I think the one you're looking for is in the back. Left corner."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny could not speak. She just starred at her mother, unable to form coherent words. She let several "uh's" and "mmm's" escape her lips before finally speaking.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sorry." She was not sure how or why she had picked that as her statement, but now that it was out, there was not much she could do about it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sorry for what?" Molly asked as she placed her dirty cup in the sink. "You don't think I didn't know what you and Harry were getting up to at that flat did you?" she asked dryly. "I may seem to be oblivious sometimes, but that's usually for my own satisfaction."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned a bright shade of red, and continued to babble.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, dear" Molly placed a hand on her shoulder. "You're a grown woman and can make your own choices. I'm just happy you were taking the safe route." She finished by reaching into the cabinet and pulling out the pink vial, which she proceeded to handed to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">She turned to head up the stairs, but stopped briefly. "I've raised you the best I could and I am very proud of the decisions you have made and how you carry yourself Ginervra. Don't ever think otherwise."</p><p class="calibre7">She began heading up the stairs, with Ginny trailing silently alongside. Molly smiled brightly at Ginny before opening her bedroom door.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry, not paying attention to who was entering began to speak, "I was wondering what was taking so long, I feel as if I've been waiting for you forever." He said, his eyes closed and his arms crossed behind his head.</p><p class="calibre7">"That's sweet Harry, but I'm really quite happy with Arthur." Molly said cheerfully as Harry's eyes opened widely and his face turned red. He began stammering almost as bad as Ginny had been a few seconds ago.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly smiled and moved to let Ginny into the room. She made to close the door but stopped at the last second. "Oh and if you do decide to partake in, well particular intimate activities, could you please remember a silencing charm. Me and Arthur do have to be up early tomorrow." With that, she shut the door and left the couple alone.</p>
