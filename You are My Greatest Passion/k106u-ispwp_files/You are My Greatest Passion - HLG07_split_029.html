<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_30">*Chapter 29*: Chapter 29</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: OMG were almost to thirty! lol im proud of myself because i first published this less than a month ago. who's awesome. im awesome. okay enough self glorification. Review me and enjoy. oh and if you have any cute side notes that you'd like to see in this story let me know. you never know, i might use them.</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p class="calibre7">"Fleur pregnant, that's something I thought I'd never say." Ginny laughed as she undressed for the night.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah it is a bit strange." Harry said as he put his dirty clothes in the basket and climbed into bed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny curled up into his embrace. "You think we'll ever be there?" she asked quietly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where."</p><p class="calibre7">"Having kids, you know the whole domestic deal." Said in hushed tones.</p><p class="calibre7">"Id like to think we will." Harry said giving her a soft kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded against his chest before she drifted off into sleep.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat in his office waiting for Ron. He idly stirred his cup of coffee and took a small sip. <em class="calibre9">Ugh. Terrible. Why can't they just have tea?</em> He wondered. He sat the cup on his desk as Ron walked through the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey mate," he said taking a seat.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey Ron," said as he looked up. "Whoa what's with the shirt?" Harry said, motioning at the violent purple shirt Ron was wearing.</p><p class="calibre7">"George thinks it's funny; says it clashes perfectly with my hair." Ron said in a sour tone.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay if you're done making fun of me, what did u want to talk about mate?" Ron asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny." Harry replied without looking up.</p><p class="calibre7">"What happened now" Ron huffed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing." Harry laughed. "Everything's perfect."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well then what did you want to talk about?" Ron asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm going to ask her to marry me Ron. I am really going to do it this time. No chickening out."</p><p class="calibre7">"I am happy for you mate. What brought on this new courage?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Fleur getting pregnant." Harry laughed. "Ginny asked if I thought we were going to had kids someday." Harry leaned back in his chair remembering the conversation.</p><p class="calibre7">"Have you asked dad?" Ron asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"I should probably do that shouldn't I?" Harry asked starring at the ceiling.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Will you go with me? You know for support." Harry finished.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I guess I could. But if I ever ask Hermione you have to go with me to her parents."</p><p class="calibre7">"Deal" Harry said shaking Ron's hand. "Let's go." He grabbed his wand and opened the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"You want to go ask now?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No time like the present right." Harry smiled, "Maybe we can catch you Dad before he leaves."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Arthur wait." Harry called as he chased after Arthur Weasley in the atrium of the Ministry.</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur turned around just before he entered the lift. "Harry?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron stopped next to Harry and bent over to catch his breath.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay, breathe mate." Harry said as he patted Ron's back.</p><p class="calibre7">"Arthur can I speak to you for a minute?" Harry finally said.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sure Harry."</p><p class="calibre7">"In private. Maybe- my office?"</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur looked at Harry appraisingly, but let Harry lead the way back to the Auror department.</p><p class="calibre7">When they were seated and the door shut Harry tried to speak.</p><p class="calibre7">"I umâ€¦" he stammered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry is something wrong?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No, no" Harry quickly assured him. "It's just well." He glanced at the picture of Ginny on his desk and smiled. <em class="calibre9">Okay I can do this. </em>"Arthur you know how much I love Ginny right?" Arthur shifted uncomfortably in his chair but nodded. "And we've been together for quite some time now. And well." He looked over at Ron, who nodded and smiled encouragingly. "I'd like to marry her. If she says yes that is."</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur let out a breath. "Is that it?" he laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry when you brought me in here I thought it was going to be something much worse. You know how one's mind can wander." He laughed another dry laugh. "Any who yes, you have mine and Molly's permission to ask Ginny. You know we already think of you as family, so really in a way it's just putting it on paper." He laughed again as he got up. "Now I hate to leave so suddenly but Molly is expecting me for an early dinner. Will I see you at the last match?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Of course, I wouldn't miss it for anything." Harry said as he moved to open the door for Arthur.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat in Holyhead stadium for the last time that season watching the Harpies play the Falmouth Falcons, Ron was on his left and Ginny's parents sat on his right. The weather had turned bad half way through the seven-hour game and the rain was still pounding down on them.</p><p class="calibre7">The game was tied and Harry was anxious for it to be over, he watched as another bludger nearly hit Ginny. Molly visibly flinched as Ginny rolled her broom to avoid it.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry's eyes sought out the Seekers. If one of them could just catch the snitch, the game would be over and he would not have to worry as much. He spotted the Harpies Seeker reaching her arm out towards a small golden object. She quickly wrapped her hand around it and the stands erupted into cheers. Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He watched as the team took their victory lap, his eyes were so fully focused on Ginny, so he didn't even see the brown ball heading towards her until it had smacked her off her broom.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry eyes widened and he watched in horror as Ginny fell the short distance to the ground. He heard Molly scream behind him as he rushed down the stadium steps and jumped the small barrier between him and the field. He made his way to Ginny's side just as the medic -wizards began loading her onto the stretcher.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," Harry said as he grabbed her limp hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"We gave her a potion to keep her asleep until we can run the needed test on her." One of the medic-wizards said as he attached a port key to the side of the stretcher. "Any family members can go to the front desk of 's to find out information. If you could please back up so we can transport her." The wizard said again pushing Harry away.</p><p class="calibre7">By time, they had whisked away, Molly, Arthur and Ron had pushed their way onto the field.</p><p class="calibre7">"We've got to get to 's s," Harry said already heading towards the apparition point.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginevra Weasley." Arthur said calmly to the receptionist on the ground floor of 's . "she was brought in from the Harpies game,"</p><p class="calibre7">The receptionist nodded and flipped through her book. "Yes she's in room 811." She motioned to a hallway to her left before going back to her paperwork.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry did everything he could to keep himself from running down the hall towards her room. He made sure he was however the first to reach the door. He almost cried when he saw Ginny. She was propped up on the bed her arm in a sling and a bandage around her head. She was silently sipping something through a straw. Harry walked into the room followed by her parents and Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hi," she said brightly when she saw them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny are you okay?" Harry asked taking a seat next to her bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I'm fine." She said as she set down her cup. Harry made to help her and she shot him a dirty look. "I can do it myself."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear you had quite a fall; maybe you should let him help you." Molly fussed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really Mum, I'm fine. They said my arm is broken, but will be fine by morning and the worse is that I might have a slight scar on my forehead." She laughed for a moment. "Hey, Harry then well match!" she laughed again, but Harry just looked at her solemnly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny do you need anything?" Molly asked as she straightened the blanket on the foot of the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, if you could go to our place and get me my night clothes that would be great. I really hate these hospital gowns." She finished looking down at the grey smock that covered her body.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly and Arthur gave her a hug before heading down the hall for the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm going to get going too." Ron said coming to stand by Ginny's side. "Hermione will probably want to stop by tomorrow." He gave her a hug and left the room.</p><p class="calibre7">The room was silent for a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," Ginny said facing him. "Are you okay?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stood and paced in front of her bed. "Ginny you could have been killed." He stopped and put his hands on the foot of her bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"But I wasn't, that's the important thing right?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No, you're not getting it. Do you know how scared I was?" he asked as he sat next to her bed again.</p><p class="calibre7">"I get it but what am I supposed to do? People get hurt play Quidditch. It's something that happens."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny I don't think you should play next season." Harry said not looking at her, but continuing his pacing.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Ginny asked, she knew she had not heard him correctly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I said I don't think you should play next season. It's too dangerous."</p><p class="calibre7">"I can't believe you." Ginny said outraged. "You're not one to talk about doing dangerous things Harry."</p><p class="calibre7">"I just don't want to see you get hurt. Don't you understand that?" he pleaded.</p><p class="calibre7">"I understand perfectly. However, do you think I want to see you get hurt? What would you say if I told you I wanted you to stop being an Auror?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Id stop if you asked me." He said seriously, looking her in the eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, well I'm not going to ask you to do that. Do you know why?" she waited and he did not answer continued. "It's because I know you enjoy it. It is your calling. Your greatest passion."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stopped and looked deep in her eyes. "Ginny, out of all the things I could choose to do in this life, you are my greatest passion. Nothing else. You." He reached out and took her hand. "I love you." He said as he kissed her hand lightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too." Ginny said softly. "And, if you really want me to take time off, I guess I can." She said dejectedly.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, you don't have to do that, just please. Try to be more careful. Maybe feign sickness the next time you play the Falcons."</p><p class="calibre7">She smiled at his attempt at humor.</p><p class="calibre7">"We'll see. I'd like to get them back for that bludger." She laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up at Ginny. He face still had slight dirt smudges and her hair was matted underneath the bandage. She had never looked so beautiful.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, I have something to ask you." he started. He dug into his pocket and pulled out the small green, velvet box that contained his mothers ring. "I love you so much, and I would do anything for you." He took her hand in his. "I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I want to spend every day, each night, every morning with you. I want to spend each waking moment of my life showing you how much I care for you. I want to be there for you anywhere you might go. I need you and I can only hope you need me too." He took a deep breath before moving off the chair to kneel on the floor. "Ginevra Weasley, will you marry me?" he asked finally as he opened the box.</p>
