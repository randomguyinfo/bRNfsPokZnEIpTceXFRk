<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_21">*Chapter 20*: Chapter 20</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N:OMGOMG! So
while writing this chapter I was watching Mamma Mia.(uber good movie
if you haven't seen it yet) and in it there is this awesome
actress, she's hilarious and I knew I had seen her somewhere before
but I couldn't remember where, so I went to Wikipedia and searched
her name, Julie Walters, its freaking Mrs. Weasley, lol haha. See my
favorite scene here </strong><span class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">.com/watch?v=0XtNRnzSRmw</strong></span></p><p class="calibre7">Or here is a great
one of her solo's</p><p class="calibre7"><span class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">.com/watch?v=m1d2Xci8qMM</strong></span></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Molly is the
shorthaired one. Hehe.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Disclaimer:
Pepperoni, mushroom and black olive pizza=GOOD </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Assuming I Own
Harry Potter= BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">OMG IT'S CHAPTER
TWENTY</p><p class="calibre7">"NEWT's are over, NEWT's are
over." Ginny was bouncing down the hall in front of a solemn
looking Ron and Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny can you stand still for a
minute?" Ron asked irritated.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just because you blew up your
potion, don't wreck my happiness." Ginny bit back.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on Harry" she grabbed his
hand and pulled them up before dancing around him. "NEWT's are
over" She said repeatedly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just smiled down at Ginny,
sometimes she acted just like a little kid and he loved it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on, let's go get something
to eat before it gets too late." Ron said grumpily.</p><p class="calibre7">They entered the great hall. It
seemed everyone was there and they had a bit of trouble finding
seats.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gods. I think I've only seen it
this crowded at the entering and leaving feast." Ron exclaimed over
the noise.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on" harry said picking up
a tray of food. "Let's take this and go eat by the lake. I can
barely hear myself think in here." Ginny gathered up a picture of
pumpkin juice and a few glasses before she and Ron followed Harry out
to the tree by the lake.</p><p class="calibre7">After a short time and many
sandwiches later, Ginny sat back against Harry. She was positioned
between his legs and he began slowly running his hand through her
hair as he spoke to Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"You can't have possibly done
that bad." Harry was assuring Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry you weren't in the room.
It was that bad." Ron said referring to his astronomy class."I
miss labeled Orion."</p><p class="calibre7">"No you didn't" Ginny spoke
up. "That was the easiest one on the whole exam."</p><p class="calibre7">"That's my point." Ron pouted.
"I've failed everything. I just know it."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, you're starting to sound
like Hermione." Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat on a couch in Gryffindor
common room waiting for Harry and Ron to come downstairs. <em class="calibre9">How
long can it take them to pack, I've been done for nearly an hour.</em></p><p class="calibre7">A few minutes
later, they emerged on the landing laughing and talking.</p><p class="calibre7">"There
you two are. What have you been doing I was about to leave without
you." Ginny exclaimed.</p><p class="calibre7">"We were packing like <em class="calibre9">you</em>
told us to." Ron said incredulously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah but for two
hours?" She questioned.<br class="calibre6"/>"Well we didn't just throw everything
in like normally, and besides we had to make sure we had everything.
Who knows when well be back here." He looked around sentimentally
and Harry faked playing a small violin.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shut up" Ron
said as he playfully hit Harry on the arm.<br class="calibre6"/>"Are you two
finished?" Ginny asked annoyed at the boy's antics. "The feast
will be starting any minute now."</p><p class="calibre7">They made their way to
the Great Hall and were met by a sea of black. They quickly found
seats among their fellow seventh year Gryffindor's as Professor
McGonagall walked up to the lecture box.</p><p class="calibre7">"Another year
passed." She said looking around." Another group leaving us and
heading out into bigger, better things. Who know which of you will go
onto to work at the Ministry, , The Daily Prophet or some of
us who may even make their way back to Hogwarts." She pointedly
looked at Neville causing a deep blush to spread all over his face.
"Whatever it is you plan to do, do it to you fullest extent and
ability. Do not waste what has been given to you and what you have
fought for." She looked among the seventh years, most if not all of
which had participated in the final battle. "And at last a toast,"
she lifted her glass and motioned for everyone to do the same "to
the Hogwarts class of 1999!" she quickly drained her glass before
sitting to let the feast appear.</p><p class="calibre7">They walked
towards the Hogwarts Express for the final time. Harry holding
Ginny's hand, Ron on Harry's left and Luna on Ginny's right.
Neville had run off to talk to Hannah Abbott about something.</p><p class="calibre7">As they
boarded the train, fully taking in the scarlet walls and grey carpet
that made up the compartment. Harry and Ginny sat on one side, Luna
and Ron the other. Harry leaned his head against the window and
starred out at the landscape as it began to roll by. He vaguely heard
the compartment door open and two people enter, but paid it no mind.
He let his mind wander to all the events that had happened on this
vessel the last seven years. He had made his first real friend on
this train, been attacked by dementors, and watch his girlfriend
make, what most people thought was one of the most attractive girls
in school, jealous. He smiled to himself before finally looking up
to see who had entered the compartment. He looked over to see Neville
holding hands with Hannah Abbott. Harry looked around, shocked
apparent on his face, but no one else seemed to register this small
gesture.</p><p class="calibre7">"When
did all this happen?" he asked pointing at the two joined hands.</p><p class="calibre7">Everyone burst
out laughing. "What?" Harry asked confused "what happened?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well
apparently some of us were zoned out." Ginny laughed patting
Harry's shoulder. "Hannah had literally just finished telling us
that Neville asked her out today."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh" was
all Harry could think to say as the other occupants of the
compartment burst into laughter again and he sunk back into the
corner.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p><p class="calibre7">"Trunks
upstairs then back down for dinner." Mrs. Weasley called out to the
three former Hogwarts students who entered the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here Ginny
let me get that for you" Harry offered as he took the trunk handle
from her. <em class="calibre9">Sometimes I think Harry
forgets he's a wizard</em> she thought
as she watched him slowly lug the two full trunks up the stairs. She
slowly followed behind him fighting back a snicker.</p><p class="calibre7">When they
reached the landing in front of Ginny's room, Harry sat his trunk
down and placed hers just inside her doorway.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
playfully leaned against him "oh Harry what would I do without such
a strong wizard like you." She raised her hand to her forehead and
pretended to feint. "I mean it's not like I could have levitated
it up here myself or anything." She laughed as he caught her. She
turned in his arms and gave him a small kiss before smiling at him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
tightened his hold on her and pulled her close for another kiss. He
ran his tongue against her lip and playfully bit at it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oi no
snogging on the landing."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and
Ginny tore apart and looked at the source of the voice.</p><p class="calibre7">"Charlie!"
Ginny jumped out of Harry's arms and ran into her brother's hug.
"What are you doing here?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Shouldn't
I be the asking what you two were doing?" Charlie asked looking at
his sister then up at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
playfully hit him on the chest. "Seriously."</p><p class="calibre7">"I just
thought I'd come out a bit early for the wedding."</p><p class="calibre7">"Wedding?"
Ginny asked puzzled. "Oh Percy's! I nearly forgot!" she raised
her hands to her mouth.</p><p class="calibre7">Charlie
laughed. "Percy's going to be hurt Gin." Ginny looked up in
horror.</p><p class="calibre7">"Charles
Weasley, you will not say a word of this to anyone." She looked at
him sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay gin.
Gees I was just joking. But on a serious note, no snogging in the
hall, there are innocent eyes here." He feigned covering his eyes
and made his way back downstairs. </p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">A few weeks
later was the wedding Ginny had forgotten all about. Harry had made a
quick trip to Diagon alley and purchased a present the day after
their run in with Charlie. Ginny dressed in her green dress robes
from Harry and finished putting her hair up before making her way
into the living room. Everyone was waiting to leave and Molly was
fussing over last minute details.</p><p class="calibre7">"Would have
been so much easier if they would have just had it here like Bill and
Fleur." She mumbled to herself. "Had to make things difficult."
She looked up to see Ginny, "Oh don't you look lovely dear."
Causing everyone in the room to take notice, and in turn causing a
deep blush to cover Ginny's face. She quickly took a seat in
between Harry and Hermione. "What are we waiting for?' Ginny
whispered into Hermione's ear.</p><p class="calibre7">"Apparently
there was a little mix-up with the port key that was issued, and now
there trying to figure out how to get us all there." Audrey was a
muggleborn and had decided to hold the wedding in a small muggle
church outside of Oxford, and it would not do well to have eleven
wizards apparate all at once.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay this
is what's going to happen," Arthur spoke loudly as he came from
the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"We are
going to leave in groups. Molly, Fleur and Bill you will be going
first apparate directly behind the church, the ministry has set up
anti-muggle charms to keep anyone away." He nodded to Bill and
Fleur and gave Molly a hug and small kiss before they headed out the
door. The distinctive noise of three pop's could be heard.</p><p class="calibre7">"okay second
group," Arthur turned back to those waiting. "Ginny, Harry,
Ronald and Hermione. Apparate straight there. Then go around to the
left side, Molly will be waiting for you. Charlie, George you are
with me. We've got to stop and get Aunt Muriel before we meet you."</p><p class="calibre7">They made
their way outside and watched as the group of four left.</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: I do not
know how easily recognizable Orion is in the uk. I know it is the
most commonly recognized where I am, (florida, usa) so that's why I
used it.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Okay I planned to
have house cup winners, but I forgot about it until after I wrote
McGonagall's speech. If you really want to know, the winner was
Gryffindor followed closely by Ravenclaw.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">How I picked
where Audrey lived. The Neighborhood I live in had all these separate
communities in it, and they all have a British name. I just happen to
live in Oxford. Lol.</strong></p>
