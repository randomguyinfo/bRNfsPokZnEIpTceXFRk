<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_62">*Chapter 61*: Chapter 60</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: WOW! Bet you didn't plan to see
this! A chapter, Omg! It's been what 4 months? A lot has happened. If
you don't know, as I was heading out to Texas to see my Husbands unit
come home I was in a pretty bad car accident. Totaled my car. But its
okay, my dad fixes vintage cars so we were able to fix it. My biggest
cost was replacing part of my frame. Scary.</p><p class="calibre7">Well after that I started writing, but
then life had other plans again. I was performing and my knee
dislocated, tearing my meniscus. I'm expected to have surgery on in
with in the next two weeks.</p><p class="calibre7">And then on top of all that my husband
is getting out of the Army! Im so excited, but scared. All weve ever
really know was Military. An I'm potty training my daughter. Who
would have ever thought that would be so difficult. Lol. Also holly
crap we are like 2 months into Hurricane Season and we haven't had a
storm yet. It's nice but scary, I'm stocking up on batteries and
water, Just in case. In Tampa we don't play. Lol.</p><p class="calibre7">On a end note, I don't know whether I'm
back for good, life may have other plans, but I promise I'll try.</p><p class="calibre7">As always, please Read and Review.</p><p class="calibre7">A new Chapter after 4 months= GOOD.
Assuming I own Harry Potter= BAD</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Sixty</p><p class="calibre7">The Weasley clan gathered at the Burrow
the night before the Hogwarts Express would take away the various
school aged children.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly made a feast only worth of her
and George managed to sneak several bottles of Ogden's past her.
After dinner the all sat around in various spots around the back
yard, talking of nothing in particular. Teddy seemed to disappear
half-way through the night and Bill spent his time searching for
Victorie.</p><p class="calibre7">James found himself in the company of
his Uncle Ron, who after a couple drink was usually funny, but this
time he just seemed to keep rambling on about his days at Hogwarts.
Sometimes he didn't know if all of the stories were true, there was
no possible way that his father had gotten in that much trouble as a
kid. He shook his head when a particular phrase caught his attention.</p><p class="calibre7">"What did you
say?" he asked Ron pointedly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, the
Marauders map. Yes great help that was. Helped us sneak around the
castle after hours." he laughed. "Actually your granddad helped
make it, and Teddy's dad too" he said taking another drink. "Yep
those were the days." he said looking around. "Hugo, stop trying
to ride the dog." he yelled as he got up.</p><p class="calibre7">James barely
noticed. He had to find out more about this map, he spotted his Dad
across the yard and began to make his way over.</p><p class="calibre7">He tapped him on
the arm.</p><p class="calibre7">"yes James?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I want to know
about the marauders map." James said sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry's eyes
went wide. "There is no such thing, you hear me?" James looked at
him sceptically, but left him alone anyway. He could tell a losing
battle when he saw one. What he need was a reckless adult that he
could mold and manipulate into telling him anything.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uncle George!"
he said excitedly. "Can I refill your glass?" he asked sweetly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nah, don't
think I need 'hick' anymore." George slurred.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah, come on, do
you want the others to call you light weight?" James teased
relentlessly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hell no."
George said refilling his glass of fire whiskey once again.</p><p class="calibre7">After a half hour
Uncle George was ready to talk.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now Uncle
George, Uncle Ron was telling me about this thing, the marauders
map?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah, the map!"
George said loudly and James was afraid his Dad would hear. "Me and
Fred, my brother not your cousin mind you, we gave it to your Dad in
his third year. Bloody helpful that thing was. Turn out Potter's Dad
had made it with his friends when they were at Hogwarts." he
laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"How does it
work?" James asked curiously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah theres the
fun part." George slurred again. "Its so simple! You just tap
it," he mimicked tapping a piece of parchment, "And…I solemnly
swear I'm up to no good. Then it just appears, Hogwarts and all it
inhabitants." he smiled fondly.</p><p class="calibre7">"But cant you
get into trouble if someone like say, a professor finds it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well that's
the beauty of it my boy, you just," he motioned tapping again. "And
say mischief managed. And poof, the map disappears and it looks like
a plain piece of parchment." he smiled. "Gods we used to have fun
with that map, well before we gave it to your Dad that is. I reckon
he still has it. I know he did during the war, he used to use it to
keep and eye on your Mum, while he was off fighting voldy-mort." he
laughed. "Aw, James I think I might have to kick in for the night,
can't drink like I used to I guess." he said sadly as he patted
James shoulder and headed towards Angelina.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny!"
Harry yelled as he ran through the house "Ginny".</p><p class="calibre7">"What?"
she asked annoyed from the office, she was trying to finish her
latest article in time for the Friday deadline.</p><p class="calibre7">"Look
what your son has done."</p><p class="calibre7">"My
son?" she asked incredulously "Yes because you had no part in
it."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny,"
he whined.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?
What could James have possibly done now?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Look."
Harry said pointing to his hair.</p><p class="calibre7">She
peered at his head "What am I looking at Harry?"</p><p class="calibre7">"You
don't see it? How can you not see it?" He said grasping his hair
and looking at it.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?
What don't I see?" she asked annoyed.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's
a grey hair! He's given me grey hair!" Harry nearly cried.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
just looked at her husband oddly. "You're that upset over a grey
hair?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
looked at her offended. "Ginny this isn't just a grey hair.
Its…it's a sign that I'm getting older."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well
Harry you are getting older." she laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah
well..." he thought for a minute, "So are you."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
just laughed as he left the room frustrated and she went back to her
paper.</p><p class="calibre7">September
2015</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you ready James?" Ginny called
up the stair case.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes!" Called an excited James
before a trunk was sent clattering down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled brightly as he appeared in
front of his mother.</p><p class="calibre7">"Was that really necessary?" Ginny
asked, hands on hips.</p><p class="calibre7">James nodded. "Yes; You look like
Grandmum when you do that you know."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny quickly dropped her hand. "I
don't not."</p><p class="calibre7">James just laughed at he made his way
to the living room. They were Flooing to Andromeda's then traveling
to King's Cross station, where for the first time James would board
the Scarlet train that would take him to Hogwarts. He was so excited
finally he would be at school with Teddy, and away from Albus.</p><p class="calibre7">Truth to be told, Albus was quite
excited to be rid of James. Ginny called up the stair, "Harry are
you ready? We'll be late."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry peaked his head out of the
Bathroom, his toothbrush in hand. "Just a minute," He managed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny huffed as she continued through
the house.</p><p class="calibre7">"Lily, Leave them on." She said
sternly as she watched Lily futilely trying to remove he tights. She
heard Harry clatter down the stairs and gathered her children in
front of the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are we all ready?" she asked
looking particularly at James.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, Mum." He drawled out.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, James you first. Your father
will handle the trunk."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry came up behind her and grabbed
the handle. "You and Lily go next?" He questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded before lifting Lily into
her arms. She knew it would have been more practical to send Albus
next, but the prospect of leaving Albus and James anywhere alone for
any amount of time usually ended in a fight.</p><p class="calibre7">She stepped out of the flames and into
Andromeda's living room. Her eyes sought out James and found him
sitting on the couch animatedly talking to Teddy about all the things
he was going to do when he arrived at Hogwarts. Teddy just sighed and
rolled his eyes. He knew there was no way James would have tea with
the Centaurs, but he didn't want to discourage him on the first day.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny walked up with Lily on her hip.
"Teddy, James are you ready?" She asked as Harry, the trunk and
Albus tumbled out of the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">James shook his head excitedly and
Teddy tugged his trunk over for Harry before turning to give his
Grandmother a farewell hug.</p><p class="calibre7">"Enjoy it Teddy," she whispered
silently. "Dora would have been so proud of you."</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy nodded his head before heading
towards the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">"Aunt Ginny, do you want me to take
Albus." he asked heavily.</p><p class="calibre7">"If you'd like." Ginny replied
softly. Teddy nodded before grabbing Albus' hand and heading through
to King's Cross.</p><p class="calibre7">"He'll be fine Andromeda." Ginny
said as she pushed James through the Floo and stepped in herself.</p><p class="calibre7">Steam surrounded the small family as
they made their way down the platform.</p><p class="calibre7">"Teddy," Harry called as he caught
up with the trunks. "She's right you know." he said placing a
hand on Teddy shoulder. "Your parents would have been immensely
proud of you." Harry vaguely remembered Remus telling him the same
thing as a child and shook off the feelings it brought. "Enjoy
this year, and if you can, try to keep James out of to much trouble."</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy gave a soft laugh, "I'll try,
but I'm not making any promises." They laughed as Harry waved hello
to Bill and Fleur as they passed by, escorting Victorie to the train.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy looked over distracted. "Uncle
Harry, I've um, got to go." he said vaguely as he grabbed his trunk
and began heading in the general direction that Victorie had
disappeared.</p><p class="calibre7">"Bye Teddy." Harry waved as he
moved over to his own son.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now James." He said kneeling in
front of his son.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know, I know. You've told me a
million times," James stressed. "Be good. I promise I'll try!"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed, "Thats a good point
but that wasn't what I was going to say."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh." James said skeptically.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, I was going to tell you to have
a good time. And if you need anything that were just an owl away."</p><p class="calibre7">James looked down bashfully. "Okay
Dad."</p><p class="calibre7">The train whistle blew and the steam
began to pump more profusely. "Hurry James you better get on or you
wont be going." Harry laughed as James quickly kissed his mother
and hugged Harry. He paused briefly before heading into the
compartment. "You will write, won't you?" He asked uneasily.</p><p class="calibre7">"Of course." Ginny said, "As long
as you write back." she threatened.</p><p class="calibre7">James smiled brightly as the train
began to pull away from the station.</p><p class="calibre7">As it disappeared from sight Harry
tugged a teary Ginny into his arms. "It'll be okay." he said
softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know, but Harry, our baby's gone
off to Hogwarts." she said.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes and as soon as you know it he'll
be back and causing problems."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed quitely as she turned to
her two other children. Lily was sitting on a stoop, obviously bored
and Albus was grinning broadly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you so happy about Al?"
Ginny asked, slightly confused.</p><p class="calibre7">Albus took a deep breath before
proclaiming, "James is finally gone." Ginny and Harry broke into
laughter before gathering their children and heading home.</p>
