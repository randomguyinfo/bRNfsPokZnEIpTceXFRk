<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_32">*Chapter 31*: Chapter 31</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Okay here is the deal, I was going to just post an author's note as a chapter but I really hate it when that happens in a story I like, so I quickly edited this chapter. Bear with me.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Now onto business. I am currently retyping my master timeline for this story so that I do not miss any wedding dates, births etc. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">In the interviews JKR released the names of all the Weasley grandchildren and I have came up with birth years based on when the parents were married, personalities and birth order of siblings but it's difficult to pick random dates to be birth days. So here is my offer: the first 12 or so people to review and leave their birth date (month and day), will get them used in the story, with credit. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Now that is reasonable right. However, some characters have specific times of year that I think they were born, like I'm guessing Lily was born Jan-Feb, so even if you're in the top 12 please don't be hurt if I don't use yours. Good Luck and enjoy.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Disclaimer: Getting your B-day in an Awesome Story=Good. Lol. Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty-One</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny reenter their flat after a dinner out in muggle London. It had taken sometime for Harry to convince Ginny to go out tonight. She spent the majority of the time shouting at people, 'my name is Ginevra', whenever they would stare. To say she was quite irritated with the article was an understatement. They headed into the bedroom and began getting ready for bed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny huffed.</p><p class="calibre7">"What is it now?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"And to insinuate I'm pregnant!" she yelled. She gave a frustrated sigh. "How could they think that?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry came behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist, before whispering in her ear. "Don't fret about it. There just jealous and trying to sell papers." He kissed down her neck softly. He trailed his hand down her body to grip her hip tightly. She wrapped her arms around his back and pulled him close to her. He brought his lips back to hers and kissed her softly for a minute before running his tongue against her lower lip. Ginny opened her mouth slightly and Harry plunged his tongue into her mouth. He moved his hands to the bottom of her shirt and slowly lifted it up; they broke the kiss momentarily to remove it and took the opportunity to slip Harry's off as well. Harry resumed his ministrations and gently cupped her breast. Ginny trailed her hands down his back to the top of his night pants she pushed at them slightly.</p><p class="calibre7">She huffed in frustration when she could not get them down. Harry released her lips and breast with a small laugh. He sat stepped back and undid the drawstring.</p><p class="calibre7">"Did you want these off?" he asked Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">She blushed madly before nodding. Harry quickly slipped out of them before leaning over and reaching around Ginny's back to undo her bra. She held out her arms and he pulled it off her. He let his hands slowly linger down her stomach to her waistband. He grabbed the hem of her pajamas and pulled them down and off her. He then gently pushed Ginny down onto the bed, kissing his way up her leg, her stomach, and her neck before finally giving her a soft kiss on the lips.</p><p class="calibre7">He hugged her tightly to him for a moment. "Harry," Ginny spoke up as he moved back to her neck. He pulled back to look at her. "I think, I mean if you want to, maybe we should. Maybe it is time we. Oh I don't know." Harry looked deep into her eyes. "Harry I want you to make love to me." Harry nodded slowly before kissing her tenderly. He let his hand wander down her body, and tugged at her knickers. He removed his boxers and lay down gently onto of Ginny. "Are you ready?" he asked. She nodded slowly, never breaking eye contact. Harry gently positioned himself at her entrance, and took a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wait harry." Ginny said suddenly putting her hands on his chest. Harry stopped and looked at her confused.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled before she rolled out from underneath him and reached into her bedside table. She retrieved a small wooden box and pulled out a pink vial.</p><p class="calibre7">She held it up for harry to see. "Protection first right? Or else the Prophet might be right." She laughed softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yeah." Harry blushed; he had completely forgotten about that, <em class="calibre9">thank gods she remembered.</em></p><p class="calibre7">Ginny quickly drained the small vial, and licked her lips. "Yum, it kind of tasted like strawberries." She smiled as she moved back underneath him. "Okay, now I'm ready." She wrapped her arms around Harry's back and kissed him softly.</p><p class="calibre7">She could feel as he began to enter her. It was not exactly painful, almost more of a burning, <em class="calibre9">like when you push yourself to hard exercising</em> she thought vaguely. She winced when he pushed in a bit roughly, and Harry stopped. "Sorry, I couldn't help it." He blushed.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay harry, keep going. Slowly." She added as an afterthought as she put on her best smile for him.</p><p class="calibre7">Then he was there, he could feel Ginny all around him. It was as if she was inside of him also. He moved slightly forward and was rewarded with a small moan from Ginny. He repeated the motion.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Harry," she cried out, her eyes closed as he rocked into her again. Soon he found a rhythm and let himself be lost in it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Gins," he moaned. It was better than flying, better than firewhisky and just as good as emotional as finally meeting his Parents. He buried his face in her hair breathing in her scent. God she was wrapped around him tightly. She had moved her arms around his back and her legs around his waist as he began to drive into her faster and faster. If he had known, it would be like this he would have all but begged her to do it sooner. <em class="calibre9">No, I probably would have begged.</em> He thought as he moaned again.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moaned beneath him and he pushed deeper. He felt her dig her nails into his back. He knew it would leave a mark but loved the idea that Monday morning in the showers after his mandatory workout everyone would see them.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry suddenly felt the urge, no the need to mark Ginny as his even more. He pushed past her hair and found her neck before latching on; He had sucked on her neck before but had always been careful not to leave any signs. Now he was determined to leave his mark. He sucked hard as he thrust into her, he felt her roll her hips against him and threw his he's back in a moan. He thrust a few more times before he felt Ginny tighten around him. She gripped his back tighter and he could swear he felt blood on his back.</p><p class="calibre7">Then she let go and let out a low scream. Harry thrust again before collapsing on top of her.<br class="calibre6"/>"Gods Ginny that was amazing."<br class="calibre6"/>"I know." she said from beneath him.<br class="calibre6"/>"Am I crushing you?" He asked<br class="calibre6"/>"No not really."<br class="calibre6"/>"Good because I don't think I have the strength to move yet." He laughed.<br class="calibre6"/>He lay there a few minutes before rolling off of her.<br class="calibre6"/>"Oh my goodness Harry your back!" Ginny sat up quickly and grabbed her wand.<br class="calibre6"/>"Here you've got to let me heal it."<br class="calibre6"/>"No," harry said as he jumped from the bed, determination in his eyes.<br class="calibre6"/>"Why not?" Ginny asked putting her hands on her hips.<br class="calibre6"/>"Because I like them." Harry said as he admired the nail marks on his back in the mirror. "Kind of like battle scars, something to brag about to the guys."<br class="calibre6"/>He laughed at Ginny's face of horror.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry James Potter you wouldn't." she narrowed her eyes at him.<br class="calibre6"/>"Oh yes I would." He laughed. "Beside its only right that I have a mark to match yours."</p><p class="calibre7">"What do you mean?" she asked dropping her wand slightly.<br class="calibre6"/>"Look in the mirror." Harry laughed, while picking up his boxers.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny got out of bed, wrapping the sheet around her, And went over to the mirror.<br class="calibre6"/>"Harry!" She screamed. I have the calendar shoot tomorrow!"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well then the whole world will know your mine."</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry that is not funny. What's my Mum going to say?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing she hasn't said already." Harry said as he moved around to<br class="calibre6"/>stand behind Ginny, circling his arms around her waist.</p><p class="calibre7">"Besides, I think it's kind of sexy. Sort of commemorates our first time."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned around in his arms to face him before kissing him softly.<br class="calibre6"/>"I love you Harry Potter."<br class="calibre6"/>"I love you too Ginevra weasley." He drew out her first name and they laughed together as they held each other.</p><p class="calibre7">Sent from my iPod</p>
