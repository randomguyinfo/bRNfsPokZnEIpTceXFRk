<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_56">*Chapter 55*: Chapter 55</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Some of you said you'd have problems getting the books I have, I know I got my copy of Magical Beast and Quidditch as a set from Books-A-Million and my Tales of Beedle Bard at Target. Lol. If your outside of America, I don't know if you have these stores, thus I'm sorry, I love Target. Lol.</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: Polishing your wand in the common room is acceptable, 'Polishing YOUR wand' in the common room is not; Neither is assuming I own Harry Potter. Lol.</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty-Five or The Conception of Lily Luna</p><p class="calibre7">April 2007</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, the kids are at Mums for the night." Ginny said furiously ripping her jumper over her head. "But with Albus you never know." she stressed. The past few times they had tried to have him spend the night, he'd come home early crying.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry pulled off his shirt and moved over to place his hands on Ginny's hips, he kissed her lightly. "I love you Gin." he said softly as he rubbed her sides.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too Harry," Ginny replied as she pulled him closer to her. He slowly pushed up her top but Ginny stopped him. "We don't have time for all the foreplay." she laughed, but Harry could sense the seriousness in her voice as she picked up her wand and banished their clothes away. "Thats better." she mumbled as she reattached herself to Harry and pulled him down onto the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh harry I've missed this." she said as he gently ran his hand up and down her sides as he slid into her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know Gin, me, uh, too." he moaned. He lifted her leg slowly and was rewarded with a deep, throaty moan. "Oh gods Harry, its been so long." Ginny cried as she clutched at the sheet beneath her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," Harry began but his words were lost in his throat.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay," Ginny breathed. "I know. Just don't worry." she said as she moved her arms to claw at his back roughly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded as he plunged deeper into her, rocking erratically. He paused momentarily before thrusting once more and collapsing on top of her.</p><p class="calibre7">He wiped the sweat from his forehead on the blanket before lifting his head to look at her. "I'm sorry, you..." But Ginny silenced him with a finger to the lip.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay, I did. Just not as earth shattering as usual." she laughed quietly, eliciting a small smile from Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh," he said attempting to move off of her. "I'm so tired." he laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay," Ginny purred as she softly rubbed his back, "Lets just lay like this for a while. Okay?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay." Harry smiled before kissing her softly and laying back down to rest.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Crap, Crap, Crap." Ginny said as she sat in the waiting room of St. Mungos.</p><p class="calibre7">She watched as Hermione flounced out of the doctors office, all smiles. "The baby is perfectly healthy." she smiled, rubbing her stomach.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, so is mine." Ginny mumbled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Hermione gasped "So it was positive?" She asked excitedly</p><p class="calibre7">"Yep, I'm pregnant. Again." Ginny Sighed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, how exciting! We get to be pregnant together!" Hermione squealed. "Oh well, I guess we kind of were last time, but this time it's closer." she bounced excitedly. Ginny almost hated pregnant Hermione, all happy and bouncy. Ugh.</p><p class="calibre7">"So how are you going to tell Harry?"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat at the breakfast table, a bowl of cornflakes in front of her. She had sent the kids to Hermione and Ron's for the day, and now she sat at the table alone with Harry as he read the paper.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," she began conversationally. "What do you think of having another kid?" she asked, shoveling another spoonful in.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shrugged, "Well I like the two we have now, so I wouldn't say I'm against it, but I'd also like to have a little more time with Albus, we had him so quickly after James." he said looking up at Ginny/ "Why?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shrugged "Because I'm pregnant." she said nonchalantly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Harry asked, setting the paper down. "Since when?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shoveled in another spoon. "Well," she began. "You remember that night we sent the kids to Mum's and Albus actually stayed the night?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded and Ginny raised her eyebrows. "Oh," he said, leaning back in his chair and rubbing at his morning stubble.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yep," Ginny sighed. "I'm seriously considering getting fixed after this one."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"You have to be careful of daisy's" Luna stated. "They harbor Nargals." she said as she helped Ginny tend to the small garden.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'll keep that in mind." Ginny laughed as she tossed another weed out of the garden.</p><p class="calibre7">After a few moments of silence Ginny spoke up again. "Luna,"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes Ginny" Luna said, dusting off her hands and looking at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I was, well me and Harry, we were wondering if well, we'd like you to be the baby's Godmother."</p><p class="calibre7">Luna nodded. "That sounds lovely, I've never been a godparent."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well thats not it. If we have a girl, which is unlikely since it seems I'm doomed to have boys, we'd like to name her Lily Luna, Is that okay?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Luna smiled brightly. "Why yes, that's perfect. Lily Luna, thats pretty Ginny."</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you," Ginny said proudly. "I've always picked girl names and Harry boy's, as you can tell." she laughed. "But really, I just stole the names from other people." she laughed nudging Luna.</p><p class="calibre7">Luna nodded, "Well thats what everyone does if you think about it." she said airily as she tossed a daisy aside, "It had Nargals, I mean do you really think I'm the first Luna?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded, "Yeah, I get it." she laughed. "But just for the record, Your the only Luna like you."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"So what color are we painting this time?" Harry asked as they stood in the last free bedroom in their house.</p><p class="calibre7">"I have no clue. James we did green, Albus yellow. I can't think of anymore neutral colors." Ginny said frustrated.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, when can we find out the sex?" Harry asked, <em class="calibre9">make thing a hell of a lot less difficult.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"Next week." Ginny sighed. She turned to him. "You want to know the sex?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shrugged, "We found out with the other two." he reasoned.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded, "Okay, I'll make the appointment, then we'll paint."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny sat in the examination room in the maternity department of .</p><p class="calibre7">The doctor entered the room, scanning the clipboard in his hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well Mrs. Potter, and Mr. Potter, are we ready to find out the sex?" he asked cheerfully and Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well lay back please." he said waving his wand to move the bed flat.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laid there nervously as he ran his wand over her midsection, she always hated this part. It was now that they could find something wrong, and no matter how hard she tried she could never kept her nerves.</p><p class="calibre7">The doctor sighed. "Well Mrs. Potter, everything is perfectly fine. Now as for the sex, are you positive?" Harry nodded vehemently and Ginny gave a short nod.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well then, let me be the first to congratulate you on your baby girl." he smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Did you just say girl?' Ginny asked excitedly. "Are you sure, you've got to be sure."</p><p class="calibre7">the Doctor nodded, "I'm relatively positive. She's kind of showing it off to the whole world," he laughed pulling up the image again.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed, "Just like her mother."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br class="calibre6"/>"Really Mum, another pink jumper?" Ginny asked, holding the small article up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well dear, girls are different than boys, You'll see when you have her." Molly smiled secretively.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, but well her room is already pink, does everything she wears have to match?" she said setting another jumper down.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well how are people going to know shes a girl."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at her Mother offended. "Like they wouldn't be able to tell."</p><p class="calibre7">"You'll see Ginny, when that first stranger ask you how old your baby boy is. Believe me, I went through it with you."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed. "Yeah, yeah, yeah."</p>
