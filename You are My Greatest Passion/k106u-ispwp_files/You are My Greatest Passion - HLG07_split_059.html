<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_60">*Chapter 59*: Chapter 59 or maybe 58 and a half lol</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: So I've done it, I've posted another story before I finished this one, I promised myself at the beginning I wouldn't but I had to. I don't know, James is just easy to write I guess. But don't worry I'm not giving up on this one, just had to find an outlet for all my James stuff, and the second story kinda sequels to this one in a way. The charaters are the same with the same personality traits and such and same memories, so where James broke his arm in this story-its assumed he did in the new one too, get it? Lol. I think im confusing, idk. Okay enjoy this. I hope. And review! And go check out my new story The Book of James Sirius Potter (name pending, not sure if I like it)</p><p class="calibre7">Disclaimer: I don't own Harry Potter.</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty Nine</p><p class="calibre7">He didn't mean to do it. But the prospect of riding his broom through the house at the time had seemed like a good idea. Of course al had warned him that something bad would happen, but al always said that. So now here James said, in the linen closet hiding from his Mum s she cleaned up the remains of her favourite gas lamp. He heard heavy footsteps on the stairs and tensed up, peaking just a bit through the door crack.</p><p class="calibre7">"Lily," he whispered. "help me."</p><p class="calibre7">The small girl smirked at him sweetly before opening her mouth, "MUMMY! I FOUND JAMES!"</p><p class="calibre7">"Lily, you brat!" james said as he stood up from his hiding spot. The turned to see ginny comeing up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"James Sirius Potter." she said pointing at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"oh no." james said quickly as he turned to run.</p><p class="calibre7">Lily promptly stuck out her leg, tripping him.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny came up beside him, as he lay face flat on the floor. " You young man, are grounded. And I'm taking your broom."</p><p class="calibre7">James kicked the air slightly as he yelled into the rug.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stood and looked at lily. "That wasn't very nice. But thank you." she smiled as she headed back down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Christmas Eve 2014</p><p class="calibre7">"James you better be clean." Ginny yelled up the stairs. "Were leaving in fifteen minutes." she stressed as she ushered a fighting Lily into her christmas dress.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why do I have to wear a dress? The boys get to wear pants." Lily reasoned.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because your girl, and my mother made me wear them, so will you." Ginny said resolutely.</p><p class="calibre7">Lily stomped out of the kitchen, muttering insults as she went. Harry passed her on his way in.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sorry im late." He told ginny as he brushed her cheek light with his lips. "Long day." He stole a cookie off the near by platter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," ginny whined "Those are for the party."</p><p class="calibre7">"And im going to the party, why I cant I eat a few now?" He asked as he shoved the remained of the cookie in his mouth.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed greatly. "Ive got to check the boys, will you go get ready?" She asked, heading for the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah I can. But gin," he asked as she began to assend the stairs. "What am I wearing."</p><p class="calibre7">"Its on the bed."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">The stopped in the back yard of the burrow and ginny turned to the burrow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now what are the rules?" she asked, shooting a non-subtle look at james.</p><p class="calibre7">"No Running." James smirked.</p><p class="calibre7">"No Hitting" Lily said from beside him.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned to Albus who sighed dramatically.</p><p class="calibre7">"No provoking people."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded, appeased by her children.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay now, go ahead in. Be sure to tell Grandmum and Grandad hello." she smiled as the three ran for the door.</p><p class="calibre7">She and Harry walked slowly up the path way to the door, reveling in their time alone.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's so quite." Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"yep, and you had to go and ruin it." Harry laughed, pulling Ginny a little closer to him.</p><p class="calibre7">They stopped just outside the door, and ginny laid her head against harrys cheast. "Its nice to have a moment alone." She whispered and Harry nodded his consent.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked up at him. "Let leave my Mum can deal with the kids." she laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah I'm sure she'll love that." Harry laughed softly. He looked down at her, the dim light from the Burrow illuminating her face lightly. "Gin, I love you." He said softly before he lowered his head to kiss her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Eww," Hugo yelled from the door way. "Dad, Uncle Harry and Aunt Ginny are snogging!" he yelled as he ran back into the house.</p>
