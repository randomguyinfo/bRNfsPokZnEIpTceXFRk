<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_10">*Chapter 9*: Chapter 9</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Same. dont own. You should review, it would make my day.</strong>Chapter Nine</p><p class="calibre7">Lunch could not have come soon enough. In every single class Ron seemed determined to sit in between them and him and harry almost had at it in charms.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't understand what his problem is. He had no problem with is and now that were back he's acting like such a…a…"</p><p class="calibre7">"A prat?" Ginny offered. Harry looked over at her and smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">It was a pleasant day so they had opted to take some sandwiches and pumpkin juice and eat out by the lake. As Harry leaned against a large tree with Ginny facing him, they watched as several first years teetered on the edge of the lake hoping to spot the giant squid.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry started laughing as one leaned too far and almost toppled in. He sighed, "I just wish he'd stop acting like this."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny crawled towards him "let's stop talking about Ron" she whispered into his ear.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry swallowed hard before wrapping his arms around her and pulling her into a deep kiss. She pushed on his shoulders so that he was flat on the ground before running her hand through his hair. She couldn't believe how right this felt, she loved being with Harry, well really everything about him really. Then it hit her. She stopped moving her lips, which caused Harry to open his eyes and look at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"What wrong" he asked confused</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing" she lied, but he caught her blush.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny" he said as he pushed himself up into a sitting position and pulled her into his arms "tell me what wrong."</p><p class="calibre7">"It's nothing, it's just, it's stupid" her blush deepened as she ran the words through her head.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly lifted her chin with his hand "nothing you say could ever be stupid. Please tell me, I want to know." his eyes were full of compassion and she thought maybe it would be safe to tell him.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's just I've never felt like this towards anyone before" she began slowly. "I think I might l..." she trailed off; she just could not bring herself to say those words. <em class="calibre9">What if he didn't feel the same way towards me?</em> She knew he could probably see the worry in her eyes. Then he did the unthinkable he laughed. Ginny's mood quickly went from worry to anger as she righted her clothes and picked up her books and began to walk away. A moment later a still laughing Harry grabbed onto her arm and pulled her back down.</p><p class="calibre7">''Gin, I love you too." he laughed and ran a hand through his hair causing it to stand up more. "I've wanted to tell you for a while, but I've been afraid." he looked at her and she could see the sincerity in his eyes. "I almost let it slip over the summer but I was afraid of how you'd take it"</p><p class="calibre7">"The day McGonagall came over?" she asked. She remembered him starting to say something but stopping himself quickly; She smiled to herself. He nodded and looked down uncertainly.</p><p class="calibre7">She dropped her books and leapt at Harry wrapping her arms around him and pushing him back down in the process. After several minutes Ginny felt Harry's hands begin to wander towards the front of her shirt. She lifted up to give him more access and he soon tugged the material free from her waistband.</p><p class="calibre7">When she first felt his hand on her skin, it shocked her, his hands were rough yet it was a nice contrast to her smooth skin. She felt his breathing start to hasten as his hand began to move farther north. She leaned deeper into his touch, and just as he was about to brush the underside of her breast, they heard books drop and the Ron yelling.</p><p class="calibre7">"What the hell are you doing with my sister?" Harry quickly removed his hand and gently pushed Ginny off of him. He stood up and tried to explain to Ron "mate I swear nothing was happing, I swe…" Harry's words were cut off by a swift punch from Ron. Ginny jumped up to catch Harry and give Ron a piece of her mind but he was already on his way up to the castle. She examined the bruise forming under Harry's eye.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on we better get you to Madame Pomfrey."</p><p class="calibre7">Madame Pomfrey did a quick healing charm, but would not let them leave until Harry told her what had happened. He claimed he had fallen, but he knew she didn't believe him, but let them leave none the less.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry gave Ginny a quick kiss outside of her Muggle Studies class and bounded down the hall towards the Defense against the Dark Arts class where he would be helping Auror Williamson plan. The bell chimed just as Harry entered the classroom. He was out of breath, when he finally looked up, he noticed Williamson reclining at his desk smoking a pipe.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah, Harry there you are" he stood and offered his hand, which Harry shook "I don't know if you remember me, I accompanied Fudge after the Battle at the Ministry"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes I remember you" Harry smiled. "So what do you have planned for today" Williamson chuckled</p><p class="calibre7">"You like to jump right into it don't you" he smiled at Harry "why don't you have a seat and I'll show you what I've been planning." he reached down and placed folder on the desk. "You know Harry I specifically asked for you to be my assistant. Not because of your fame with Voldemort, but because of how you organized the students a few years ago. I knew you'd have great input, and already know how to teach."</p><p class="calibre7">"But Sir why would it be important if I know how to teach" Harry questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well because my dear boy, I cannot just quit my job at the Ministry and most of the time you will be covering my classes. Don't worry it's all be discussed with the headmistress."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded but wasn't sure if he was okay with teaching. Why hadn't McGonagall mentioned that when she asked him? Maybe because she knew he would have refused, now he was stuck.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well we better look at the plans then." Harry figured if he was going to have to teach he better know what he was in for.</p><p class="calibre7">An hour later the bell chimed again and students began filling into the class. Harry had already taken his seat toward the front when Ginny came in and sat next to him. She gave him a mischievous smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny what did you do?" Harry asked worried</p><p class="calibre7">"What makes you think I did something?" she asked innocently as she took her seat next to him and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. Harry just shook his head; he knew she had done something and that it more than likely involved Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">As if on cue, Ron entered a moment later spotting a very dark black eye. He glared at them as he took a seat a few tables away. Harry leaned over towards Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"What did you do to him"</p><p class="calibre7">"I used one of Fred and Georges products. It won't come off with magic"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry gave her a disappointed look. "The same one Hermione got a black eye from a few summers ago?"</p><p class="calibre7">"The same solution, different vessel" she said in a tone that was clearly proud of herself.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny…"</p><p class="calibre7">"What he deserves it?" She said defensibly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just wrapped his arm around Ginny's shoulders and laughed as he held her tight.</p><p class="calibre7">Soon Auror Williamson called order to the class and started the lesson. Practicing disarming spells, and very much to Harry dislike Williamson paired them off and chose Ron as Harry partner. While practicing Ron seemed to be trying to take his frustrations out on Harry, but Harry blocked every one of his spells. Finally, Harry disarmed Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"Expelliarums." Ron's wand flew through the air "what's your problem?" Harry asked as Ron picked up his wand.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron just glowered at him "sorry if I don't like the idea of my 'former' best mate basically shagging my sister" a few people stopped what they were doing and turned to watch the two argue.</p><p class="calibre7">"It was nothing like that" Harry said defensively "and beside, if Ginny wanted to shag me that's her decision."</p><p class="calibre7">"She doesn't know what she wants, and she doesn't need some filthy bloke trying to get at her every time she turns around."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just starred at Ron, shocked. He could not believe that the person who was supposed to be his best mate and the person who had encouraged him to work things out with Ginny was saying these things.</p><p class="calibre7">"If you haven't noticed Ron, Ginny makes her own decisions. I would never make her do anything she didn't want to, and anyway she'd probably hex me to pieces if I tried." now it seemed like the entire class was watching, including Auror Williamson.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well" Ron stammered for a response. "Stay away from my sister" he added sharply.</p><p class="calibre7">"And what are you going to do if I don't" Harry asked, he really didn't want to affront Ron, but he was being a complete git.</p><p class="calibre7">"Then I'll be force to kick your arse." he raised his fist and took a menacing step towards harry. This was when Ginny lost her cool.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ronald Bilius Weasley." she bellowed "if you do not stop this minute, I'll…I'll" she racked her brain for a good enough punishment. "I'll tell Hermione!" she shouted as she headed for the door.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron's face suddenly went from angry to scared. If Hermione found out how he had been, she would tear the nicky out of him. He dropped his fist and ran after his sister; she was already halfway down the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny wait!" he yelled. She slowly stopped and turned to face him. He could see the tears in her eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Please, just...I don't know. Just please don't tell Hermione." he pleaded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why shouldn't I you git" she scoffed at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny I don't know what's wrong with me." he ran a hand through his hair nervously. "it's just, it's weird you know, I've never liked seeing you with guys and with Harry you two just seem so...close. And frankly that scares me. You're my little sister. Well that and I don't have 'mione around to keep me in check." he finished with a small laugh.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at her brother sympathetically. She hadn't even though how her and Harry's relationship had affected him. He probably felt like he was losing his sister and his best mate at the same time, and to top it off, as he said, Hermione was not around. She reached out and hugged her brother</p><p class="calibre7">"Git" she whispered softly. She slowly let go of him and he looked down ashamed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron I'm sorry too, I didn't think how all this affected you." she paused to let the words sink in. "but you should be happy for us, we love each other and want to be together." she looked into his eyes pleading with him to understand. He slowly smiled at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sorry Ginny, but I promise to try from now on." he grabbed her shoulder a squeezed "next time I'm a git just threaten me with Hermione right off." he smiled and they both broke down into a fit of laughter.</p><p class="calibre7">After several minutes, they both walked back into the Defense classroom. Everyone had gone back to practicing, with the exception of Harry who was brooding in a corner, his arms crossed sternly over his chest and his face in a scowl. His face lightened when he saw Ginny, but soon darkened again when he saw Ron walking behind her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come back for more" Harry asked smugly. Ron's face began to blush and his ears turned red. He mumbled something under his breath.</p><p class="calibre7">"What was that" Harry asked bluntly. Ron looked up at Harry embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I said I'm sorry." he saw the look of disbelief on Harry's face "I really mean it mate, I've just been going through a few things, and it's hard for me. I mean you know how I hate seeing Ginny with blokes and, well this time it's difficult because I still want to be the big brother but at the same time you're my best mate. Am I making any sense? Its times like this I really miss Hermione" he finished with a small chuckle.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah I guess" Harry mumbled. "but you're going to have to get used to the idea of me and Ginny being together."</p><p class="calibre7">"I promise I'll try, I really will."</p>
