<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_15">*Chapter 14*: Chapter 14</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: I apoligize in advance, this one is uber short. It's actually more of a filler. But i do find it kind of funny, definatly worth the read. ok enjoy. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Disclaimer, Smoking is bad and so is assuming that I own Harry Potter.</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fourteen</p><p class="calibre7">The cool blanket of darkness fell over the castle while the seventh year boys of Gryffindor tower gathered eagerly around Seamus Finnigan's trunk.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ey' here we are boys." he said pulling two bottles of amber liquid out. "The best Ireland has to offer" he sat the bottles down that Harry now recognized as firewhisky and dived back into his trunk pulling out several glasses. "'kay who's ready to get sloshed." he said pouring a round. Harry reluctantly picked up his glass. He'd never really drank before and was unsure of how it would taste. Or worse how he would react. He looked around at the others, none of them seemed to have the same reservations as Harry so he decided to put his doubts into the back of his head and resolved to just try to have a good time. He reached his glass out to Seamus who quickly filled it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Cheers mate" Seamus said knocking his glass against Harry's. He watched as Seamus threw his head back and swallowed the shot. Harry decided it would be best to try to get it over with quickly. He brought the glass up to his nose and to a whiff. The smell burned his nostrils and Harry could only imagine what it would do to his throat. He slowly placed the rim to his lip. "Come on Harry" he had barely noticed Seamus watching him. Harry quickly tossed back the drink. It burned as it slid down his throat, but then it began to pool in his stomach and make his entire body warm. Soon the entire sensation took over him and he found himself holding his glass out for another.</p><p class="calibre7">"Out there in Kenmare there's this little pub on the edge of town. Kelley's. Upstairs lives this cute little blonde Witch. Mary McGregor. She always good when you need her. If you know what I mean" Seamus nudged dean. Who nodded with wide eyes and a smile. "I swear the girl never locks her door. More women need to be like her."</p><p class="calibre7">"Here, here" dean cried out lifting his glass before he drained it.</p><p class="calibre7">"So 'arry" Seamus suddenly turned his attention to Harry. "Exactly how far have to gone with little Miss Weasley? Shagged her yet, you looked right close the other day"</p><p class="calibre7">At the last comment, Ron sputtered and spilled whisky all over his shirt. He looked wide-eyed at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"No Seamus, we haven't <em class="calibre9">shagged</em> yet." Harry said pointedly taking another drink of his whiskey. Ron let out a low breath and smiled. Seamus poured another round and the rest of the night was spent drinking and talking about quidditch, girls and the newest broom models.</p><p class="calibre7">The next morning Harry woke up with a splitting headache. He could hear Ron snoring loudly from the next bed and it did nothing to soothe his head. He looked up to the sound of someone laughing softly. Ginny sat on the edge of his bed with two mugs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here" she said, handing one of them to him. "This should help." after he had taken the mug she moved over to Ron's bed and gently nudged him awake. He looked at her groggily before she motioned towards the mug. He took it without question and began drinking it down. Harry looked down into his mug hesitantly. He didn't know what it was, and while he trusted Ginny, he wasn't exactly sure he should drink it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh Gin." he waited for her to turn her attention to him. "What exactly is this?'</p><p class="calibre7">"Imbibo venenum" she replied with smile. When he gave her a questioning look, she rephrased it. "Drinking potion."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh" was all Harry could think to say before slowly gulping down the thick liquid. It tasted worse than Polyjuice potion. He made a face as he gulped it down. Ginny laughed "we'll that's what you get for drinking all night with Seamus. You should know to never drink with the Irish." She laughed again as he shot her a dirty look.</p><p class="calibre7">After he and Ron had both finished off the potions, and had time for them to start working. Ginny gathered the mugs and made her way to the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't forget the train leaves in four hours." she smiled before turning and leaving the room.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry leaned back on his pillows and closed his eyes. <em class="calibre9">Two full weeks with Ginny</em>, he never thought he had been so excited to be going to the Burrow for Christmas.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry, Ron and Ginny slowly made their way to the train along the way finding Neville and Luna. They found an empty compartment and stowed away their luggage. The boys sat on one side and on the floor as they settled in for a game of exploding snaps, while Luna enlightened Ginny with her father's newest articles in the quibbler.</p><p class="calibre7">"We'll be spending this Christmas in Sweden."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really. That sounds like so much fun."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes. I and father are hoping to finally catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled at the airiness of her friend.</p><p class="calibre7">Soon they were pulling into Kings Cross Station. George met them on the platform and helped retrieve their luggage before heading for the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: just to let you know they story Seamus tells is from the song Drink and Fight by Flogging Molly's. Their awesome I love them. Here is a link to listen to the song. Review! </strong>.com/additem/1400119</p>
