			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Okay i couldnt leave you hanging so im posting again. lol. Also i forgot to tell you, harry's proposal is a reworded version of the lyrics "all i ask of you" by Andrew Llyod Webber. If you dont know who he is, google it. and if you have never seen Phantom of the Opera, in person not the movie. i suggest you do so.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Also someone asked if this story was going to end after the wedding. I hope not, i really hate that when you get used to an author's style and then they abruptly end a story, only to leave you wanting more. So as i said in the Summary, i want, no i need to do the entire 19 years. maybe some more too. lol. as long as i keep thinking it up ( and i keep getting review, hint hint,lol) you never know. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">What i dont know is if this story will cover the 19, i may have to sequel it if it gets too long...</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">and as to harry's ooc behanior last chapter. when you truely care about someone you can sometimes take on a different personailty, trust me. and may sometimes ask for unbelivible things. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">OKAY! LOL.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Please enjoy and review.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Chapter Thirty=(hopefully) GOOD Assuming i own Harry Potter= BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty</p><p class="calibre7">Molly and Arthur were walking down the hall back to Ginny's room when they heard a loud scream. They took off down the hall and rushed into her room.</p><p class="calibre7">When Ginny accepted his proposal, she nearly leapt off the bed into Harry's arms. They were in the middle of a heated kiss when Molly and Arthur reentered the room, both wearing worried expressions.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear. Discretion. And what was all the screaming?" Molly asked, clearly upset with her daughter's behavior.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh mum, look." Ginny said, as she broke away from Harry and held up her left hand for examination.</p><p class="calibre7">"Goodness me." Molly said as she lifted her hands to her mouth. "My baby's getting married," she cried as she wrapped Ginny in hug, mindful of her broken arm.</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur walked over and shook Harry's hand. "Good job Harry."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned to her father and hugged him before sitting back down in the bed, Harry right by her side.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly walked over and held Ginny's hand out and inspected the Emerald. "It's beautiful, you did an excellent job Harry, did you have anyone help you pick it out?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No not really," Harry laughed running his hand through his hair. "It was my Mum's, so praise my Dad for picking it out. I just had to retrieve if from the vault"</p><p class="calibre7">"Really it was you Mums?" Ginny asked softly looking at her hand "Oh Harry, that's so sweet. I promise ill take care of it."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well she said in the letter that she hoped that someday I'd find the one that completes me, like my father completed her." He smiled shyly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh harry" she sighed again. She gave him a soft kiss before turning to her parents. "Okay we have to talk about something else before I cry."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly smiled brightly, "Ginny dear, any idea when you want to have the wedding?"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry arrived at the Burrow just after work. He had not even had time to change because Molly wanted to get some wedding planning done early on. Harry went to make his way into the family room but Mr. Weasley stopped him.<br class="calibre6"/>"Here you might need this." he said thrusting a glass if amber liquid into Harry's hand.<br class="calibre6"/>Harry sniffed at it "Firewhisky?"<br class="calibre6"/>Arthur nodded before heading up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"But mum I really like the cream."<br class="calibre6"/>"But the beige will work better Ginny."<br class="calibre6"/>Harry looked up from his glass as the clock chimed. Molly and Ginny had been disagreeing over the color of tulle for the last hour. <em class="calibre9">I do not even know what tulle is</em> Harry laughed to himself.<br class="calibre6"/>"I have to work tomorrow," he stated trying to get up from the couch. However, apparently his body had a different plan and he stumbled back onto the couch spilling the remainder of his drink on his robes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry dear, how many glasses have you had?" Molly asked looking at him appraisingly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I really don't know, every time it would get down here." He pointed at the bottom of the cup. "I would just…" he pointed his wand at the glass quickly replenishing it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry we had better get this out before it stains" Ginny said leaning over to examine the spot on Harry's robes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mmm" Harry moaned as he moved his hand to Ginny's neck. "Do you know how much I like having your head in my lap?"</p><p class="calibre7">Molly made a tuting sound and Ginny quickly sat back up her cheeks flaming red.</p><p class="calibre7">"It makes me really hard." Harry continued. "Would you like to see?" he smiled before reaching at his robes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear I think it's time you took Harry home. Before we all see something we don't want to." Molly said quickly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded before helping Harry off the couch. She gave her mother a quick good bye before heading for the apparation point.</p><p class="calibre7">Once back at their flat Ginny dropped a sleeping Harry onto the couch and made her way to the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry woke up the next morning. His head was pounding and his entire body was stiff from sleeping in an awkward position on the couch.</p><p class="calibre7">He glanced down at his watch. "Shit," he yelled loudly getting up from the couch. "Ow," he held his head to try and keep the room from spinning as he made his way into the kitchen. Ginny was sitting on the counter eating an apple.</p><p class="calibre7">"Have a good night Harry?" she asked laughing.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, not now. I've got a pounding headache and I'm late from work." He said looking around for a cup.</p><p class="calibre7">"I already called in for you," Ginny said taking another bite from her apple.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I called into work for you. Clowes said he understands perfectly, the stomach flu has been going around you know." She smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry walked over to stand between her legs. "Do you know how much I love you?" He said as he laid his head in her lap.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, but you did tell my Mum how much you love having my head in your lap last night." Ginny said seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">"No." harry groaned. "Did I do anything else?" he asked and Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Then you proceeded to try to show us how hard I make you." Harry's head whipped up in horror and he whined in pain. "Don't worry we stopped you before you had even unbuttoned your robes."</p><p class="calibre7">"Uhg. I just want to go to bed and forget all of this." He said as he nuzzled his head in her lap.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh you can try and forget, but I don't think my Mum will be anytime soon."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded into her lap again. "We should just lay in bed all day." He said into her lap.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sounds good to me. Do you know how hard it is to side-apparate someone when their plastered?" She laughed as she ran her hand through his hair. "I was exhausted!"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Several hours and a few take out containers later, Harry and Ginny were still sitting in bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you have any fives?" Harry asked taking a sip from his butterbeer.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nope, go fish." Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think I've lost already," Harry said as he looked at his cards. "You've got what, eight sets already. There's no possible way I can win." He said as he set his cards down.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled big as she gathered the rest of the cards up and sent them to the hall closet. "What do you want to do know?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well my headaches gone so…I can think of a few things." He raised his eyebrows suggestively before grabbing Ginny around the waist and pulling her underneath him. He tickled her until she cried out.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, Harry you've got to stop it." She cried through her laughter as she fruitlessly tried to push his hands away. "Gods please."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stopped and let his body weight rest on top of her before kissing her forehead. "I love you."</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too. But that wasn't very nice." She tried to act mad, but could not seem to get rid of the smiled that was plastered on her face.</p><p class="calibre7">"I can think of a few ways to make it up to you," Harry said as he raised his eyebrows suggestively again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not now harry," she laughed. "How about we go into Diagon alley, we can get some ice cream and look for wedding stuff." She said bouncing up and down on her knees.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay I guess." Harry said, making a big production of giving in.</p><p class="calibre7">A half hour later, they walked out of Florean Fortescue's ice cream parlor. Harry held Ginny's hand as they strolled down the street, "so where to now?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well we could go into the flower shop and look and see if there is anything we like."</p><p class="calibre7">They walked the short distance to the shop. Ginny picked up a small bundle of lilies. "I'd really like to use these, but I don't think they'll be enough alone." She held the small lily up to harry. "What do you think?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I like them, what about them and the one's I used to get you at the games, the smaller lilies."</p><p class="calibre7">"Calla's?" Ginny laughed as she handed him one.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah that's the ones." Harry said as he took the offered flower. He held it carefully next to the other one Ginny had picked. "I think they look good together."</p><p class="calibre7">"Me, too." She said looking at them. "Oh goodness harry!" Ginny shrieked. "We just made our first wedding decision!" she smiled brightly. She jumped into his arms and gave him a big kiss. And that is when the flash bulb went off.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry was sitting in his office the next day drink a cup of tea when the Daily Prophet was delivered. He groaned when he read the headline, all through he was already expecting it. He carefully unfolded the paper so he could see it fully. In big bold print across the top it read, "BOY WHO LIVED ENGAGED." And underneath it was a photo of him and Ginny kissing at the flower shop, below that was a close up from the larger photo, of the ring on Ginny's hand.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat the paper down and rubbed his eyes before going back to read the article.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Harry Potter, better known as the boy-who-lived or The Chosen One is reported to be engaged. First hand, photos show him and his chosen one, Virginia Weasley, shopping for flowers, presumably for their upcoming wedding. The date is at this point unknown. What brought on this engagement at such an early age, we can only speculate. Could we be expecting any young potters anytime in the near future? </em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Harry potter was unavailable for comment at the time of printing and the employer of , Holyhead National official statement was 'we are very happy for our newest member, but will not be giving any personal details on the matter. Now please exit the pitch.'</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Turn to page 6 for a journalistic History of Harry Potter</em></p><p class="calibre7">Harry crumpled up the paper and threw it into the rubbish bin. <em class="calibre9">Ginny going to be furious, Virginia Weasley? </em></p><p class="calibre7">Harry leaned back in his chair. It was going to be a long day.</p>
