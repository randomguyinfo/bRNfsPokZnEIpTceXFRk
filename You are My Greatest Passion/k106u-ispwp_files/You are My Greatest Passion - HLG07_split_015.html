<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_16">*Chapter 15*: Chapter 15</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Omg I am so
sorry for not updating for Christmas, I do not know if anyone has had
that head flu, but I finally caught it, everyone I know has had it
and I just thought they were being babies but it really is as bad as
they say it is. I am hoping I just got a condensed version (my mom
had it for a month!) but anyways thanks to a combination of mucinex
and Dayquil I'm at least getting this chap up! So review and make
me feel better! Lol. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Oh! I almost
forgot! It seems there was some confusion as to who came in back in
chapter one and said they were happy to see Harry and Ginny back
together, I'm going to go back and fix it but just so you don't
have to go back and reread it, it was Molly. I knew in my head who it
was so I guess I just assumed it played out on paper that way too.
Lol.</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifteen</p><p class="calibre7">They arrived at the
Burrow just before dinner, Molly hurried off to start cooking and the
three of them headed up stairs to unpack their trunks.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was just
removing the last of her clothing when Harry and Ron appeared in the
doorway. Harry leaned down and kissed her on the cheek. "Me and
Ron are going to go play a pickup game of quidditch before dinner.
You game?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled and
nodded before getting up and following them down stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly looked up when
she heard noise on the stairs. "And where are you going"</p><p class="calibre7">"Going to play a
quick game," Ron offered before heading out the door with Harry and
Ginny in tow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear will
you stay and lend a hand" Molly tried to be inconspicuous.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at the
boys crestfallen before shutting the door and heading over to help
her mother.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't look so
excited about it dear." Ginny faked a smile. "Pass the potatoes
will you dear?'</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny picked up the
bag and began washing the potatoes and handing them to her mother.
They silently cut the vegetables and Mrs. Weasley put them in the pot
to stew. She cast a quick charm on the pot and sat at the table
motioning for Ginny to join her. Ginny slowly sat down at the table.
She was afraid of where this might be going.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, dear."
Molly grasped Ginny's hand. "I think it time that me and you had
a chat."</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Oh no, this can't
be it. </em>When
Ginny had a nightmare, this is what they usually consisted of.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now Ginny. While
I'd prefer you wait until you become" Molly paused and searched
for the correct word. "Intimate. I know that, that may be
unrealistic." <em class="calibre9">oh
no oh no oh no </em>Ginny
really wished she could just be outside at the moment. "Now you do
understand the initial concept of sex, yes?" Ginny absentmindedly
nodded. "Good no need to go into detail there then." Molly gave a
small forced smile. "Now dear," she rubbed Ginny's hand for
good measure. "How much do you know already?" Ginny could not
form coherent words. She sat, with her mouth agape trying to piece
together a sentence, when Molly let out a laugh. "How about I ask
questions and you nod yes or no if you already know the answer?
Okay?" Ginny slowly shook her head up and down. "Now you do know
that, well you first time it will hurt." Molly watched, as Ginny's
eyes grew bigger. "Oh apparently not. Well yes. A girls first time
can be rather painful. But I promise you it will get better."
another nod from Ginny. "And you will, you may bleed a bit so don't
be surprised." Ginny let out a soft noise. The more she heard the
more she was beginning to dislike the sound of sex. "But dear, let
me assure you, it will get better. Know you know all about protecting
yourself from, well accidents don't you?" another nod. "Well in
my day they taught a spell to the males, but you can never be too
sure." she flicked her wrist towards the cupboard and a small
cauldron and potions kit landed neatly on the table. "Now today I'm
going to show you how to brew a Contraceptive potion." she moved
her wand toward the stairs and a few seconds later Ginny's school
cauldron was positioning itself on the table. Molly opened her kit
and carefully removed several vials of ingredients. She next pulled a
book out of the bag and placed it in front of Ginny. "This is the
Growing Witches Complete Guide. What were brewing today can be found
on page" she quickly thumbed through the book. "Sixty-two."
Ginny looked down at the book that was opened to the instructions for
how to brew Antigravida. "Okay first we need" she lifted several
vials and read the labels. "Ah here, Mugwort Root." Molly
carefully added a bit of the brown root to her cauldron and handed
the vial to Ginny, who then mimicked her mother's ministration.
They spent the next half hour adding ingredients to the cauldrons
before Molly pulled some empty bottles from her bag and began
siphoning her liquid into them.</p><p class="calibre7">"But mum" Ginny
said apprehensively. "How do I know if I've brewed it right?"</p><p class="calibre7">Molly smiled at her
daughter before waving her wand in three circles over Ginny's
potion and whispered the words ostendo sum. A small pink puff of
smoke emitted from the liquid. "See there, that's how you know if
it's right. Don't worry," she said rubbing Ginny's shoulder.
"If you forget, it's all in the book." she finished filling the
bottles before summoning a box and placing them inside. She then
proceeded to place the ingredients in the box followed by the book.
"Now Ginny, I want you to be careful. I suggest you read this book
before you even think about doing anything. Okay?" Ginny slowly
nodded her head. "And you know if you ever have any questions you
can come to me, or well write." she smiled lovingly at her
daughter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes mum." Ginny
picked up the box.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay dear. Why
don't you go put that up, and then go get the boys for dinner.</p><p class="calibre7">Later that day Ginny
sat on her bed turning one of the small vials in her hand. What had
prompted her mother to giving her 'the talk'? <em class="calibre9">Ron
must have said something; he never knows how to keep his trap shut.
</em>She
looked at the small bottle in her hand. It was amazing the way the
pink and white seemed to swirl together. She let out a sigh before
reaching down to put the bottle back in the box. As she leaned down,
the book her mother had given her caught her eye. She picked it up,
it seemed harmless enough. The Growing Witches complete guide, she
briefly wondered what other information she could find in the book.
As she opened the book she was greeted with a surprise, apparently
the cover did not convey the entire title. On the front page, the
words <em class="calibre9">to
sex </em>were
indiscreetly added. Her eyes widened as she flipped through the
chapter index and she read some of the titles. She was about to put
the book aside when two word that were unfamiliar to her caught her
attention. She glanced to see page number and quickly thumbed her way
through the book to it. She
read the
title and below it were, what ginny assumed, were very graphic moving
pictures of how said acts were performed. She meant to immediately
close the book and throw it aside, she really did. However, for some
reason she just could not seem to tear her eyes away from the page.</p><p class="calibre7">She barely
registered the door opening and Harry stepping inside. It was not
until he spoke that she tore her eyes away.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you
reading?" he asked causally.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked at him
wide eyed before slamming the book shut and shoving it under her
pillow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing" she
said as calm as possible, trying to hide her blush.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled at her as
he sat next to her on the bed. He slowly eased himself on top of her
and began to place gentle kisses on her lips. He slowly deepened the
kiss and she was so distracted by the way he was moving his tongue
that she did not even notice when he reached under her pillow and
pulled out the book. He broke the kiss and she gave a small whimper.
He held the book out and smiled at her before looking at the title.</p><p class="calibre7">"The Growing
Witches Complete Guide, what could be so bad about this Gin?" he
asked as he opened the book. She watched as he read the rest of the
title. He took a deep breath before he spoke again. "Okay." he
pulled out his wand and muttered <em class="calibre9">permaneo</em>
she watched with fear as the book quickly turned itself to the page
she had been on. She watched as Harry swallowed. She closed her eyes.
<em class="calibre9">Oh,
gods </em>she
thought to herself <em class="calibre9">he's
going to think I am a pervert. Just let him yell quickly and leave.
Don't let him drag it out. </em>She
slowly opened her eyes but found a sight she was not expecting.
Instead of the disgusted look she had expected, he was smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, would you."
he looked down shyly. "Would you be interested in trying this?"
Ginny's eyes widened.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Harry, when
you came in I had just opened the book. I didn't even know that
was." she pointed to the words at the top.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh" was all
Harry said as he lowered his head. He looked almost disappointed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I mean unless
you'd like to try it," Ginny said taking the book from his hands
and examining the pictures.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well uh, I... I
just don't want to pressure you into anything." He stumbled
through his words. Ginny smiled. "Harry you've never pressure me.
Anyway, do you really think I would do anything I didn't want to?
Beside it looks like it, it could be fun."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really you want
to try it?" he said with a gleam in his eye.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not tonight. I'm
tired." she noticed that he seemed disappointed. "But maybe
sometime soon." she gave him a quick kiss and sent him on his way.
<em class="calibre9">No
not tonight, but soon. </em>She
smiled to herself and began to get ready for bed.</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: I really
have no clue what they read in the book, but I'm open to
suggestions. I had a thought but I'm not sure if I want to go
there… yet. Lol. Let me know your thoughts! Thanks, merry late
Christmas! Hehe</strong></p>
