<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_51">*Chapter 50*: Chapter 50</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Wow, sooo many people asked if
Ginny was prego....jeez haven't you ever ate too much? Lol.
Anywho....here is our time jump, I actually dated Ron and Hermione's
wedding and this new chapter so you don't get lost date .
Enjoy, read and review!</p><p class="calibre7">Disclaimer: Fooling everyone into thing
Ginny's prego?=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty!</p><p class="calibre7">November 14th 2004</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny fell onto the bed in a
tangle of limbs. Ginny laughed as harry brushed a stray piece of hair
behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too Harry." Ginny
smiled before she leaned up to give him a soft kiss. She dropped her
head back onto the bed. "I can't believe Audrey's pregnant again,"
she said as she crossed her arms behind her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well she is a Weasley now."
Harry laughed as he moved off of her and laid down. "I mean were up
to what, Four nieces and nephews. Well I guess five if you count
Percy and Audrey's latest announcement. And well Teddy." he
laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed "what gets me is George,
I never though I'd see him as a serious role model." she laughed
thinking about the way George was with his son, Fred.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah well he's a good dad." George
had been doting endlessly on the small boy since he had come home a
little less than a month ago.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and they laid there for a
while in silence.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked over at Ginny, she seemed
asleep, her eyes were close and she was breathing softly. He moved
down to pull the quilt over them when she opened her eyes. "Harry,"
she said softly and he turned to look at her. "mmm, I love you."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry moved on top of her again. "I
love you too." he said softly before lowering himself onto her. He
brushed her lips softly with his own as he let his hands trail down
her sides. He tilted his head slightly and played with the skin as
the edge of Ginny shirt rode up. He lifted his lips from hers long
enough to slip her shirt above her head and unbutton and slide out of
his. After he had tossed them aside, he kissed her again, this time a
bit rougher as he ran his tongue against her lip.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moaned as he ran his hand down to
her jean button and he slipped his tongue into her mouth. He explored
her mouth slowly as he undid the jeans and slipped them off of her.</p><p class="calibre7">"gods Gin," he said roughly as he
sat up to take of his own pants. He laid back down and pushed against
her. "I love you." he panted a bit as he rubbed against her
again.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love , you too." Ginny panted as
she pushed him back. "Wait Harry." she rummaged through her
bedside drawer and emerged empty handed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shit." she said aloud.</p><p class="calibre7">"What? Whats wrong?" Harry asked
leaning towards her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm out of potion." she said
downhearted. "We cant do this," she motioned between them "until
I brew some more." she said laying back down.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry moved closely beside her and
kissed her neck softly. "How longs that going to take?" he asked
nipping at her ear gently.</p><p class="calibre7">"A few hours." Ginny responded
dryly.</p><p class="calibre7">"i can't wait a few hours." Harry
said as he moved on top of her and pressed against her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry..." Ginny said sternly, a
hand on his chest.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny..." Harry responded,
pressing into her against her again, this time earning a moan in
response. "See neither can you." he moved against her slowly,
causing Ginny's limbs to involuntarily wrap themselves around him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry threw his head back in victory
before stripping himself of his boxers and Ginny of her knickers. He
moved back and kissed her fiercely. Ginny mental counted days in her
head. <em class="calibre9">Okay maybe this will be fine.</em> She though as Harry poised
himself above her. She moaned loudly as he plunged into her.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Molly stood at the stove, mechanically
basting the turkey for Christmas dinner. In her opinion magic was a
great help when cooking, but there were just somethings that needed
to be done by hand. She straightened from her position when she heard
the back door open.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, Ginny!" she yelled coming
over to hug them. "Been doing well? Eating right?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded vehemently as she wiggled
from of Molly's grasp. "Were fine Mum." she sniffed them air and
made a face. "What is that?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Turkey dear. You usually love it."
Molly said, a bit of hurt in her voice.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. "I know, it's just this
darn stomach bug. Haven't been able to eat anything really."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly nodded and squeezed Ginny's
shoulder before turning back to the stove. "Why don't you two head
into the family room, everyone else is already in there. Ready for
presents." she said, her head bent over the turkey again.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">The family sat the table, empty plate
slew across the surface. Ginny listened idly as the rest of them
chattered endlessly.</p><p class="calibre7">She leaned carefully over to Harry.
"Can we go. I don't feel so well." she said closing her eyes and
leaning on his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded, careful not to jostle
her. "hey,mate." he nudged Ron "Were going to head home.
Ginny's not feeling to well." he said softly before carefully
getting up from his chair, lifting Ginny with him. He lead her out
back and apparated them away.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
quickly jumped out of the floo. "Is Ginny here?" he asked looking
around.</p><p class="calibre7">"No.
Why?" Ron asked through a mouthful of cheese puffs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because
she is going to kill me." Harry said as he moved around the room
uncomfortably.</p><p class="calibre7">"Can
I ask why?" Ron said, furrowing his brow.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
stopped his nervous pacing and smiled. "Yeah, its great. Well I
think its great. Ginny's not so thrilled."</p><p class="calibre7">"What
is I…" Ron began, but was cut off as Hermione tumbled from the
floo.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry,
Ginny's on her way here."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
eyes grew wide. "No. did you tell her I was here."</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione
nodded. "I'm sorry, she basically questioned the whole ministry
looking for you. Finally she got fed up and held me at wand point."
Hermione defended. "She's very upset with you. What did you do this
time?" she asked placing her hands on her hips.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'll
explain later. I've got to find a place to hind." He eyed the linen
cupboard. "That'll work." He said as he made his way over and
smushed himself inside.</p><p class="calibre7">A
few moments later Ginny busted out of the fireplace, anger radiating
off of her. "Where is he?" she asked through her teeth.</p><p class="calibre7">"Who?"
Ron asked shoving another puff in.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
held her wand to his face. "You know who. Now where is he?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron's
eyes grew big at the threat of Ginny's wand and he silently pointed
to the linen cupboard.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
stomped over, but before she could open the door Harry jump out and
made a run for it.</p><p class="calibre7">She
furiously swatted at his fleeting back yelling "Harry James Potter,
you did this on purpose!"</p><p class="calibre7">"What
did he do?" Ron asked, still unaware of what was happening.</p><p class="calibre7">"She'd
pregnant." Harry beamed proudly, still dodging Ginny's fist. "Eight
weeks so far." He said reaching for her belly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
pushed him back with her wand. "Don't touch. I am very upset with
you." She pouted. "Do you understand what this means?" she
asked shakily, obviously on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
looked at her confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"I
was on a record, the only person who has played first string on the
Harpies this long is Gwenog!" she said throwing her hands up. "And
now I can't play. I'm going to lose my spot on the team."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
moved to wrap his arms around her and vaguely registered Hermione
dragging Ron from the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm
sorry Gin, but I can't help but be happy. I mean, were going to have
a baby." He said as he softly kissed her forehead.</p><p class="calibre7">She
laid her head on his chest and breathed in deeply. "I guess, it was
just a shock you know. I wasn't expecting it, and I just signed my
new season contract yesterday." She finished with a huff.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
looked down at her and nodded in understanding.</p><p class="calibre7">"So,"
she said softly, "Were going to have a baby." She placed her hand
on her stomach before taking a seat. "Oh goodness. Were going to
have a baby." She panted slightly. "Harry, what are we going to
do?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well,"
he said taking a seat next to her. "Were going to adjust. We'll
just have to figure things out, were in this together." He took her
hand in his and held it tightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Can
we come back in?" Ron asked impatiently.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
gave a small laugh. "Yeah Ron."</p><p class="calibre7">Ron
walked tentatively back into the room, followed by an annoyed looking
Hermione.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ronald
have you ever heard of the concept of patience?" she asked as they
took their seats.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron
looked at her confused. "What do you mean by that?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing
Ronald, nothing." She said before turning her attention back to
Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"So,
how are you?" she asked uncomfortably.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
gave another small laugh. "Not to good, but…well get through
this." She squeezed Harry's hand and smiled. "Let's head home."</p><p class="calibre7">They
stood and said a quick good bye before they entered the floo and
headed home.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat on the couch, a thin blanket
around her shoulders, as Harry walked back into the living room
carrying two cup of tea. Ginny took the cup with a small thank you
and Harry tentatively took a seat next to her.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in silence for a moment before
Ginny spoke up. "Were going to need a bigger place." she said
calmly looking around.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well unless you want to give up your
office to make into a nursery..." she trailed off.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yeah, forgot about that." Harry
laughed uncomfortably as he stirred his tea. "I guess I don't have
too much experience with babies, well except Teddy and he always went
home with Andromeda at the end of the day." he said softly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked over at Harry, and unsure
expression on his face. She gently grasped his hand. "We'll be
alright, growing up with six sibling you think I'd know a thing or
two, but I was the youngest." she laughed. "I have no clue what
to do." she squeezed his hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I'm sure your Mum can give us
some tips," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh gods, Mum." Ginny exclaimed,
"she's going to have kittens when she finds out." she sat her cup
down on the table and buried her head in her hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"When do you want to tell her?"
harry asked softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'd assume the sooner the better.
Ron and Hermione already know, and you know he can't keep a secret."
she said a bit sourly. "I guess tomorrow at Sunday Dinner would be
best..." she trailed off in thought. "But I want to tell her and
Dad privately first." she finished.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just nodded as he went back to
his cup.</p>
