<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_37">*Chapter 36*: Chapter 36</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Okay. Chapter Thirty-Six. Enjoy. Review. </strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Oh yeah, in the Birthday List P/A stands for Percy and Audrey. lol. and all the names and parents came from the family tree JKR posted after DH was released. You can find it at the harry potter lexicon.</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty-Six</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in the back booth of the pub they had chosen to go to.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron had suggested a drinking game in an effort to ease Hermione up a bit. They sat in the small booth, a bottle of firewhiskey in the middle of the table and a full shot glass in front of each of them.</p><p class="calibre7">This turned out to bad as seeing Hermione had never done anything bad and they were having problems coming up with things they themselves had never done.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny pondered her statement for moment before her eyes went bright. "I've got one," she said as she shot a smile at Hermione. "I've never lived with muggles." She said smugly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry quickly drained his glass and it refilled automatically. Hermione however picked her up and looked at it appraisingly, as if trying to figure out the best way to go about drinking it.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh come on already." Ginny said, motioning for Hermione to drink.</p><p class="calibre7">The other girl slowly lifted the glass to her lips and drained it. She set the glass down making a disgusted face. "Uh, terrible." She said.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't worry Hun." Ron said rubbing her back, "it'll start to taste better."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay," Harry said trying to think of his. "Ha, I have never worn girl's knickers." He smiled triumphantly at Ginny and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny swiftly grabbed her glass and gave Harry a defiant look before draining it. Hermione again took her time.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron took no time shouting his, "I have never kissed a bloke." Ginny took her shot again before asking, "I thought this was supposed to loosen Hermione up, not me." She laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione sat with a smile on her face as the table awaited hers. She began slowly and made sure to speak clearly. "I have never played in a school, or professional Quidditch match." She looked at the other three making sure they had heard her.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled as he tapped his glass against Ginny before draining it. A song began blarring across the pub and Harry grabbed Ginny's hand tightly. "Would you like to dance?" he slurred a bit while slipping an arm around her waist.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why yes I would," Ginny said as she slid out of the booth.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry grabbed the bottle of firewhisky and took a gulp before getting up. "I'll need that." He laughed as he led Ginny onto the dance floor.</p><p class="calibre7">They stumbled out of the floo a few hours later still dancing. Harry spun her around in the living room a few times before pulling her close for a kiss. Ginny giggled against his lips, and they began swaying again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, you're so pretty." Harry said roughly. She could smell the firewhisky still on his breath and it made her giggle again.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry began dancing them down the hallway, before the stepped into the bedroom, he gave Ginny a spin.</p><p class="calibre7">"Whoa, that made me dizzy." She laughed as he pulled her close.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed back before pulling her in for another kiss. He sloppily ran his tongue against her lips and Ginny opened her mouth to it. Harry roughly pushed his tongue into her mouth and swirled it against her own.</p><p class="calibre7">In her drunken haze, she did not register him backing them up to the bed until her legs hit the back and he pushed her down.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked down at her, his eyes full of desire. He bent down and slowly ran his hands up and down her thighs, "Ginny," he moaned as he gave her a leg a small kiss. "Mmm, I'm going to make you feel really good." Said as he worked his way up, roughly pushing her skirt up around her waist.</p><p class="calibre7">Then he laughed. Ginny propped herself up on her elbows. "What's so funny?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed again. "I banished your knickers." He slurred.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, okay." Ginny said as she lay back down.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry slowly kissed his way up until he met the area where her leg joined the rest of her body.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny let out a low moan when he clumsily pushed a finger into her. He began lazily moving it in and out of her, watching her face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, more." Ginny pleaded after a few moments.</p><p class="calibre7">He quickly slipped in another finger and quickened his pace. As he pushed his fingers in and out of her, he slowly lowered his head.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny jumped slightly when his tongue first ran against her, but then began pushing into the feeling. He flicked his tongue against her again "Oh gods Harry." She yelled out as she reached her hands down and tangled them in his hair.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled against her as he pushed his tongue against her again and began pumping his fingers harder, yet keeping a slow pace. He let his tongue lazily make circles against her, eliciting soft moans from her over and over again.</p><p class="calibre7">He began to slowly speed up his fingers and began flicking his tongue back and forth against her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny slightly arched her back off the bed and pulled tightly at his hair. "Harry…oh." She moaned and he increased the pressure. He felt her begin to tighten around his fingers and pushed as fast as he could in and out of her. "Harry, oh gods. Yes. Oh." then she fell back to then bed and let go of Harry's hair.</p><p class="calibre7">He gently pulled his fingers out of her and gave her one last lick before moving to lay his head on her stomach.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry that was amazing." Ginny said through a yawn. "Harry?" she asked when he did not respond. She looked down to see Harry sleeping silently on her stomach, his hands clutching her thighs.</p><p class="calibre7">She sighed as she reached for a pillow; she placed it behind her head before nodding off herself.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron entered Harry and Ginny's flat the next morning, only to find it oddly quite. <em class="calibre9">I hope Harry did not forget about our plans to go flying,</em> he though as he checked the kitchen for his best mate or sister. <em class="calibre9">Probably still sleeping. Some people cannot hold their liquor; </em>he chuckled to himself as he made his way down the hall. <em class="calibre9">Whom are you kidding, the only reason you are walking is because Hermione was smart enough to brew hangover potion, before we went out.</em> He slowly pushed open the door, and if it would not have been his sister, he would have laughed at the situation. Well at least a little more than he did. He walked over to where Ginny's head was, he nudge her hard on her arm.</p><p class="calibre7">She opened her eyes angrily. "What, I'm trying to sleep here." She yelled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I can see that. But it's almost noon."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny's eyes softened a bit. "Really? Wow, I must have drunk more that I though."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah," Ron sighed. "I had plans to fly with Harry this afternoon." He said slightly glancing at Harry who was sleeping, still positioned between Ginny's legs. From what Ron could see at least Ginny skirt was hiked up and he hated to think what he would see if Harry moved. He shuddered a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">It was not until Ron mentioned it that Ginny registered the weight on her midsection. She looked down at Harry, still sleeping soundly. She gently ran her hands through his hair and called his name softly. Harry slowly began to stir; He quietly looked up at Ginny and smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"I had the best dream…" he trailed off.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oi," Ron said loudly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked over confused. He had not even seen Ron in the room. <em class="calibre9">What he doing her so early?</em> He chanced a glance at his watch. <em class="calibre9">Damn noon, we were supposed to go flying.</em> Harry made to move off Ginny, but stopped when he pressed upon her and she let out a squeaky moan.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron do you think you could give us a moment." He asked, lying back down to ensure that he was still covering Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"More than happy," Ron said, a disgusted look on his face as he exited the room, closing the door tightly behind him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry moved off Ginny and they quickly dressed before Harry left to fly with Ron and Ginny went back to sleep.</p>
