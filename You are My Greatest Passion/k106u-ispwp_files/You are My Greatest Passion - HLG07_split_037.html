<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_38">*Chapter 37*: Chapter 37</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Okay sorry the last chapter
rather sucked, I just need a way to get where I was going. lol. If
that makes any sense. Any-who, hopefully this chapter makes up for
it. And to clear up any doubt, in the epilogue it does talk about Ron
passing a driver test and asking harry if he parked okay, so
apparently somewhere in the 19 years they did move into muggle means
of transportation. It's canon. lol. Just wanted to put that out
there. Okay read, review, enjoy!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: The new Qdoba down
the street= awesomely good Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Ginny cuddled in a little closer to
Harry. "That was great."</p><p class="calibre7">She gave a sigh as he pulled her
into him. "I know." Harry laughed. "I love you."</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too Harry." he gave
her a kiss atop her head and they slowly nodded off to sleep.</p><p class="calibre7">It was nearly two am when Molly
stepped out of the floo into Harry and Ginny's apartment. Bill had
just called to let them know Fleur was at the beginning stages of
labor, and that it was time to get the family ready. She silently
made her way through the apartment, flicking her wand to turn on
lights as she went. She stopped at the bedroom door and rapped at the
door. She waited for a response and after a few moments grew
restless. Still had to inform George after all.</p><p class="calibre7">She knocked again before slowly
opening the door; she silently appraised the scene in front of her
before making a small tuting sound in the back of her throat.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginervra Weasley you better be
wearing clothes under that blanket." She bellowed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny opened her eyes to the sound
of her Mother's question. She tightly grasped the blanket to her
chest as she sat up. "Mum! What are you doing here?" she asked,
suddenly wide-awake.</p><p class="calibre7">"I should be asking you what
you're doing laying in a bed naked with Harry." Molly retorted.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny began stuttering for a moment,
trying to string together a plausible reason for her to be in the
undressed state. <em class="calibre9">Well aside from what we were actually doing, no
need to make her angrier.</em></p><p class="calibre7">Molly starred at Ginny for a moment
as she tried to come up with a response before continuing. "Also,
Fleur has gone into labor."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Ginny gasped, her eyes
going wide. "Harry, Wake up." she said quickly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry moaned as he rolled over, the
blanket slipping a little further, to down around his waist.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, wake up now." Ginny said
pushing at his shoulder with the hand that was not holding the
blanket.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not now Ginny," he said as he
covered his eyes with his arm. "I'm sleeping."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny pushed at his shoulder again.
"Harry…" she drew out.</p><p class="calibre7">He rubbed his eyes a bit. "Fine.
If you want it that bad." He said, laughter in his voice, as he
grabbed at Ginny's body.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, we have to go to the
hospital." She said sternly, pushing his hand away.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry slowly opened his eyes, "Why?"
he asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Fleur has gone into labor. We
have to go." Harry made to get out of the bed, "Harry my Mum's
here." She added quickly. Harry stumbled to grab the blanket and
cover himself as he sat back down.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked up promptly to see Molly
at the end of the bed looking rather upset and anxious.</p><p class="calibre7">"Um," he said uncomfortably as
he grabbed his glasses and looked at his watch. "Good Morning?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I've got to get George. I'll
meet you at the hospital." Molly said pointedly ignoring Harry's
comment and naked state.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat in the waiting room, his
head on the back of the chair, repeatedly counting the ceiling tiles.
Ginny had fallen back to sleep a while ago, and was currently resting
her head on Harry's chest.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">93, 94…wait did I count that
one twice?</em> Harry refocused his eyes on the ceiling. He looked
down when he heard the familiar squeak of the hospital door opening.
He looked over expecting to see Molly standing there; waiting to tell
them it was probably going to be another hour. He was surprise to see
Bill slowly pushing his way through the heavy doors, a huge smile on
his face.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry carefully nudged Ginny awake.
She protested slightly, but woke right up when she recognized Bill's
figure in front of her. "Is it over?" she asked, the sleep still
apparent in her voice.</p><p class="calibre7">Bill nodded. "Would you like to
meet your new niece?" he asked motioning towards the double doors.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's a girl?" Ginny asked
excitedly as she got up from her chair, she wobbled slightly. "Sorry.
Legs are still asleep."</p><p class="calibre7">Bill let out a small laugh as Ginny
grabbed his arm. "It's okay. And yes she is a girl, or more of it
a…oh well I'll just let Fleur tell you her name. I'm still not
sure if I'm saying it right." He laughed as he led Harry, Ginny
and the rest of the Weasley siblings, along with Hermione, down the
small hall.</p><p class="calibre7">He stopped towards the end of the
hall and motioned towards the door on his left.</p><p class="calibre7">When they entered, Harry was
surprise to see Fleur looking rather disheveled. He had never seen
her in such a state and it almost made him laugh a bit. That was
until he noticed the small bundle in her arms. He watched as Fleur
reluctantly handed the small pink bundle to Ginny. He vaguely
registered Molly in the corner of the room making comments to Arthur
about how natural Ginny looked holding a baby. He made his way over
to stand behind Ginny. As he placed his hands on the back of her
chair, he peered down at the tiny bundle.</p><p class="calibre7">"What's her name?" he asked as
the baby gave a small yawn.</p><p class="calibre7">"Victorie Ann Weasley." Fleur
said exhausted. "Ve thought her name fit, considering vhat today
'es." She said as she grasped Bill's hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"why?" Harry asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well her name means Victory. In
French." Bill explained, when Harry just continued to stare at his
confused he continued. "you do know what today is right? I would
think you of all people would." Bill said with a small
uncomfortable laugh.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's May 2nd dear."
Molly said from behind him.</p><p class="calibre7">A look of understanding flashed
across Harry's face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh. I agree, it fit's
perfectly."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was frantically searching
through the bins that currently crowded the living room of her and
Harry's flat. "We did buy baskets for the flower girl's right?"
she asked her mother. "Yes dear. They are here somewhere, don't
worry."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny straightened herself and put
her hands on her hips. She gave a great huff. "Well they are not
here. Well have to get new ones."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly calmly reached in to a bin and
handed the baskets to Ginny. "You need to calm yourself. Come have
a cup of tea." Molly said ushering her daughter into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat at the small table as
Molly fixed the tea, rubbing her temples.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here dear, drink up." Molly
said as he handed Ginny the cup and sat down.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny took a deep sip before setting
the cup down. "Im just so stressed." She sighed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I understand dear." Molly said
calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I mean, why did I ever think it'd
be a good idea to get married so far away. I understand why I picked
it, for Harry and all but…" she trailed off and looked at the
clock. "Where is he anyway? He was supposed to help me take things
to the church."</p><p class="calibre7">She began impatiently tapping her
foot under the table.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, calm." Molly reminded
her. Ginny nodded but did nothing to stall her foot as they sat
finishing their tea in silence.</p><p class="calibre7">Twenty minutes later when the front
door creaked open and Harry entered the kitchen, Ginny had worked
herself into a fit.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where have you been?" she
yelled when he walked into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just looked at her confused
and stunned.</p><p class="calibre7">"We have to take things to the
church. Or did you forget?" she accused.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry took a deep breath before he
spoke. "I had to finish up something's at work, and then I had to
pick up the car. Or did you forget that part." He retorted dangling
the keys in his hand. "We can just show up at a muggle church with,
50 some odd bins and no visible transportation." He finished and
Molly gave him a sympathetic look. Ginny just looked angry.</p><p class="calibre7">"There are only ten bins." She
said coolly as she put her cup in the sink and walked into the living
room.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry walked in as she was shrinking
down the bins so that they would fit in the car.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly walked over and placed a hand
on Ginny's shoulder. "Remember dear, calm. I'll see you later."
She said as they hugged.</p><p class="calibre7">She gave Harry a quick hug and a
whispered good luck before disappearing into the flames of the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just starred at Ginny for a
long moment. "Are you okay?" he finally asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gave a great sigh as she sat
on the couch. "Did you ever think it'd be so stressful?" she
asked pushing her hair out of her face.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry came over and hesitantly sat
next to her. "The wedding?" she nodded. "Well yeah, you
remember your Mum planning Bill and Fleur's. She almost went into a
panic over ribbons and… and icing." He motioned largely with his
hands.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. "I just thought our
would be different. I didn't think we'd get so…" she trailed
off and made a motion with her hands. "Do you know what I mean?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded. "It's okay though.
I think everyone is supposed to be stressed about their weddings. I
guess that's why most people only do them once." He laughed and
Ginny gave him a look.</p><p class="calibre7">He pulled her close. "Aw come on.
You know you are the only one for me. Even if that meant we had to go
through the wedding planning a million times."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled up at him and he gave
her a light kiss as he pushed a stray hair behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in silence for a while,
just enjoying each other's presence.</p><p class="calibre7">"So are you happy your second
season is over?" Harry asked breaking the silence.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I guess." She said as she
leaned back into his chest. "Kind of weird, though."</p><p class="calibre7">"Why is that?" He questioned as
he idly brushed a hand through her hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"I finished my second season on a
Professional team. And survived. Not everyone gets to say that."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah well, that's what makes
you special." He laughed and playfully messed at her hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry stop it." She squealed,
pushing at him playfully as he pulled her into his lap.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked down at him and smiled
before kiss him gently on the lips. When Harry went to deepen the
kiss, she stopped him. "Harry we have to get to the church." She
said trying to get up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh you want to do this in a
church," he waggled his eyebrows at her. "Kinky Gin." He
laughed reaching towards her.</p><p class="calibre7">"You know what I mean." She said
swatting at the hand that was going for her bum. "Now help me get
these into the rental car."</p><p class="calibre7">"Who said rental car?" Harry
asked as he began to levitate a few boxes.</p><p class="calibre7">"I thought you were getting one?
Did Kingsley loan you one of the ministry cars?" she asked
confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"No. I just decided to buy one.
It's red." He smirked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Red? Why would you want such a
disgusting color?" she asked making a face as she followed him down
the stairs, the levitated boxes in front of them.</p><p class="calibre7">"I happen to like red." Harry
said as he grabbed at one of the scarlet tendrils of her hair.</p>
