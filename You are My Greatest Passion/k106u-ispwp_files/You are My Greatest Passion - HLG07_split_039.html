<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_40">*Chapter 39*: Chapter 39</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: No really note on this chapter
but…I have bit of a problem. I am about to start writing the
Honeymoon chapter but cannot decide where to send them, spent two
weeks at Disney world myself but eh. Let me know your suggestions so
I can pick one and get it written! Te-he. Read, review and enjoy!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: Possibly going to Magic
Kingdom tomorrow=AWESOME! Assuming I own Harry Potter=Not so good.</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter thirty-nine</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stood in the middle of Les
Robe de Mariée, the small wedding dress shop at the south end of
Diagon Alley. She appraised herself in the mirror again, taking
herself in from all angles.</p><p class="calibre7">"You look fine," Hermione
assured her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked over at Hermione and
Luna, who nodded in agreement with Hermione. <em class="calibre9">I made the right
choice with green</em> she thought, as she looked them over. The deep
emerald color contrasted well with Hermione's olive skin and Luna's
pale shade of white. She turned back to herself in the mirror<em class="calibre9">.
White really is not my color. Just washes me out more. </em>She
thought as she looked down at the lacy dress.</p><p class="calibre7">It was not big and overdone like
Fleur's had been. It was simple and hung close to her body; the
only detail that made it extraordinary was the delicate lace that
layover the dress.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, she finished the coat."
Luna said as she brought a box over.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. <em class="calibre9">Do not see why I
need a coat; I could just use a warming charm.</em> However, Kingsley
had insisted that they look as muggle as possible when entering the
church and town. They were already pressing their luck with having
the men wear dress robes. If she showed up in a sleeveless lace gown
for a walk in the snow, they would probably haul her off to
. <em class="calibre9">Or wherever they take the muggle's.</em></p><p class="calibre7">She took the offered coat from Luna
and slipped it on, mindful of the dress. It flared out to over the
dresses train completely, granted the dress trail was not <em class="calibre9">that</em>
long, and came up just around her neck. The neck and wrist hole were
lined with fur and it was beginning to make sweat.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay it fits. Can I take it off
now." She asked anxiously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny are you okay." Hermione
asked as she placed the coat neatly back in it box.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded fiercely. <em class="calibre9">I just
need to get out of this dress and get some fresh air. A nice walk in
the cool air. Yes that is what I need</em>. She assured herself as
Luna and Hermione worked to get the dress off her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny are you okay?" Hermione
persisted as they walked down the street to the Leaky Cauldron. Ginny
just nodded silently again. <em class="calibre9">Harry</em>. <em class="calibre9">That is what I need. I
just need to see Harry. That will calm my nerves.</em> With a renewed
energy, she walked a little faster towards the bar.</p><p class="calibre7">When they entered, Ginny stood on
her tiptoes to look for Harry over the crowd. She spotted a messy
black head next to a red head and a brunette and quickly made her way
over that way, Luna and Hermione trailing behind her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry" she cried when she got
close enough for him to hear and moved into him arms. He looked at
her oddly when she buried her head into his chest. "Gin are you
okay?" he whispered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah," she said softly. "Just
needed some reassurance."</p><p class="calibre7">"About what?" Harry asked
pulling away to look at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh nothing." She blushed a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, really Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">"I just needed to see you. To,
well you know."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry furrowed his brow. "What do
I know?" Harry asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"To make sure that this was the
right thing." She reasoned.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why would you need reassurance
that this was right?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know. Just last minute
jitters."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, okay." Ginny vaguely
registered an unsure tone in Harry's voice but pushed it aside as
he pulled her back into him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry curled his body around Ginny a
little tighter. "Oh this is the last night we'll lay like this"
he mused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why do you say that?" Ginny
asked, turning her head to look up at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't mean in this position.
I mean as Boyfriend, girlfriend, fiancés, whatever you want to call
us." He pulled her closer and gave her a kiss on the top of her
head. "Tomorrow you'll be spending the night at the Burrow with
Hermione and Luna, then the next night." He pulled her chin up to
look her in the eyes. "We will be married, and I can hold you as
much I want." He kissed her lightly and hugged her close to him.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled into his chest and
breathed in his scent. Tomorrow she was going to be Mrs. Harry
Potter. The mere though sent a shiver down her spine and made her
want to smile uncontrollably. She clutched at his arm, needing to be
closer to him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you Harry." She
whispered softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too Gin." he said as
he kissed her head once again before they fell into sleep, still
embracing each other tightly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny awoke the next morning more
refreshed that she had ever felt. Harry had already left for the
ministry, but left a note expressing how much he could not wait to
see her at the rehearsal later that night. She smiled to herself when
she read the last line. He had written out her full name and
underlined Weasley, then promptly drawn an arrow to it and written
'not for long'.</p><p class="calibre7">She tucked the note into her
overnight bag and went around the room gathering the things she would
need. She paused when she picked up the box with her jewelry for the
next day. She opened it and examined the pieces inside. She had taken
a trip with Harry one weekend down into his vault and found the
necklace set. He was not sure if it was his Mum's or some distance
relatives of Sirius' but she liked it nonetheless. She fingered the
tiara that she had placed in the box with the set. It did not exactly
match the emerald set necklace but her mum had insisted that she wear
Aunt Muriel's tiara. She grimaced at the memory of the
conversation. <em class="calibre9">No need to go there again,</em> she thought at the
memory of her Mother's fit. She carefully placed the box in her bag
and continued about the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hello Ginny." Luna said airily
from the kitchen table as Ginny entered the burrow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey Luna, what are you up to?"
Ginny asked setting her bag down.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I was just explaining the
danger of Nargal's to your Mother."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stifled a giggle and looked
over to her mother who had a face to rival Hermione on. <em class="calibre9">I guess
she has never endured one of Luna's theories before.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," Molly said, "Would
you care for a cup of tea?" already up from her seat and pouring
the warm liquid.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks Mum."</p><p class="calibre7">"Feeling nervous Ginny?" Luna
asked as Ginny sat with her cup.</p><p class="calibre7">"I was, but after I talked to
Harry I don't know, it just kind of disappeared."</p><p class="calibre7">"That's good. It would be
terrible to go through this whole planning process and not go through
with the wedding." Luna stated mater of factly.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly once again gave Luna an
appraising look before shaking it off. "Hermione just called,
she'll be here any minute."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and took a deep breath,
"I guess I better go get ready for the rehearsal. Care to help
Luna?' Ginny asked, knowing the sooner she got Luna away from her
Mother the better.</p><p class="calibre7">Luna nodded excitedly and they
headed up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">A few hours later Harry apparated to
the Burrow. He tugged relentlessly at his collar. <em class="calibre9">I</em> <em class="calibre9">hate
ties.</em> He thought sourly.</p><p class="calibre7">He walked the short way up the
burrow and Ginny greeted him at the door. After a quick kiss, she
gave him an odd look. "What are you wearing?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked down at his outfit. He
thought he had done pretty well picking it out on his own.</p><p class="calibre7">"What's wrong with it?" he
asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well the khaki's are okay, but
that shirt and tie." She clucked her tongue. "I'm sorry, I know
you probably tried your hardest, but they don't match." She
laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes they do. They are both blue."
He said looking at the shirt again.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny just shook her head and
laughed. "Come on harry, I'll change it for you. Besides I can
make it so that it matches my dress." She mused s she pulled him up
the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">When they entered, her room Harry
stopped short and starred at her room.</p><p class="calibre7">"whoa." He surveyed the make-up
and hair items scattered across the surfaces of Ginny's room. "I've
never seen your room look so…" he trailed off trying to think of
the proper word.</p><p class="calibre7">"Feminine." Ginny supplied. "I
know. Hermione and Luna. Driving me crazy." She picked up her wand
and took aim at Harry's shirt. She quickly changed it into a more
appropriate white one with thin green strips. She lifted her wand and
appraised her work. After a content sigh and a shrug, she aimed her
wand at the tie and turned it into a deep green that matched her
dress.</p><p class="calibre7">"There. Perfect." She smiled.
"Now you match and we match."</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, yeah sure." Harry said
looking down at his shirt. <em class="calibre9">I thought the blues matched. </em></p><p class="calibre7">They stood in the back yard of the
Burrow, Harry's car parked next to two rented ministry cars. They
carefully decided who was to ride with whom and twenty minutes later
Harry pulled out with Ginny, Luna and Teddy in his car.</p><p class="calibre7">"Car go vroom." Teddy would
exclaim every few miles. Luna found this quite amusing and seemed to
study Teddy the entire ride, making blatant comments on toddlers and
their ability to be influenced by creatures not too much unlike
Nargals. Ginny could only nod and hold in her laughter from the front
seat.</p><p class="calibre7">When they arrived at the church,
they took a few minutes to stretch their muscles before heading into
the church. The plump muggle minister greeted them at the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah, great to see you again." He
said enthusiastically shaking Harry's hand. "Im pretty sure
everything is in place like you wanted." He motioned toward the
doors that led into the chapel. "If you need to move anything feel
free." He pumped Harry's hand one last time. "I'll be in my
office if you need me."</p>
