<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_5">*Chapter 4*: Chapter 4</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">Chapter Four*</p><p class="calibre7">As Harry entered the bank he could sense a few Goblins staring at him with scowls upon their faces, but the majority paid him no attention at all.</p><p class="calibre7">They made their way up to the next available teller. Harry told the Goblin about the message Mrs. Weasley had delivered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ahh, yes. Follow me Mr. Potter" croaked the Goblin.</p><p class="calibre7">They followed him down a long passage way with numerous doors on each side.</p><p class="calibre7">Finally they reached the end of the hall and the Goblin stopped at a door. The name plate informed them that the office belonged to a Goblin named <em class="calibre9">Bogrud</em>. Underneath the name plate was a label that read <em class="calibre9">Inheritance Authority. </em>Ginny looked at Harry quizzically but he just shrugged his shoulders as they were lead into the office.</p><p class="calibre7">Sitting behind a rather large desk was an older, but somewhat kinder looking Goblin. He motioned for them to sit down it the chairs in front of the desk as the other Goblin exited the office.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hello Mr. Potter I'm, as I'm sure you can tell from the name plate, Bogrud and I am in charge of the inheritance department here at Gringotts bank."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, but why am I hear, I've had the key to my families vault for years now and Sirius's gold and the deed to Grimmauld Place were already put into my vault." Harry questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">The Goblin laughed "My dear boy you can't possibly think that was all the gold your family had! The Potter's were an old wizarding family and descendant's of the Peverall's. No to mention that the Mr. Black was quite wealthy too." He laughed again.</p><p class="calibre7">"So why am I just now finding out about this?" Harry asked a little irritated that the Goblin was laughing at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't be offended dear boy, but it is Gringotts policy that underage Wizards are only allowed access to a certain amount of their families gold, even if they are the last remaining member, as too keep their assets safe. We determine a set amount that should take the Wizard through schooling and place that amount in the vault from the beginning, then year year we place a stipend into the vault for other necessities."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," was all Harry could mutter, a little ashamed at getting so upset.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well then how much more is there?" He asked after a moment.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah, I thought that'd be your next question." Bogrud stood up and walked over to the wall, he traced a large square on the wall and out popped a draw full of records. He skimmed through the records until he found the one it was looking for.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah ha, here we are. Mr. H.J. Potter." He brought the rather thick folder over to the desk and set it down. "All the information is in here Mr. potter. "He tapped the folder with his right index finger and a perfect copy of it appeared to its left. He picked up the copied folder and handed it to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here you go," He said as Harry took the folder. When Harry made a motion to ask why he couldn't have the originals, Bogrud interrupted him.</p><p class="calibre7">"It is Gringotts policy that we maintain the original records, again for your safety." Harry nodded brieftly before sitting and staring at the Goblin, not knowing what to say.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well Mr. Potter," Bogrud said after an uncomfortable silence. "If you don't have any questions, I have work to do." He made a motion towards the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh! Yes, sorry." Harry mumbled. He walked out of the office and down the hall with Ginny next to him.</p><p class="calibre7">When they were outside of the bank, he turned to her with a surprised expression on his face, and then he looked down at the folder in his arms. "I have no clue what any of this is." He said bashfully.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, we'll just have to figure it out when we get back to the Burrow." Ginny said with a smile. He looked at her and couldn't help smile back. She was always so cheerful about any situation. He reached up one hand to her cheek and gave her a soft kiss, then they disappeared back to the Burrow to conquer the mystery that was the folder from Gringotts.</p><p class="calibre7">They arrived at the back door to the Burrow and they could already smell the delightful foods inside, they walked the door to find Molly standing over the stove stirring a large pot of what Harry assumed to be beef stew.</p><p class="calibre7">"There you are." She said without even turning from the pot "Why don't you just go wash up, it should be done any minute now." Harry and Ginny went up stairs to wash up and Harry made a quick stop by his room to drop off the folder from Gringotts They ran into Ron on the first floor landing as they headed back down to the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey mate, so what did they want at Gringotts? They still upset about the break-in?" Ron asked curiously.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, nothing like that. They wanted to discuss my inheritance. They gave me a huge folder of paperwork and I have no clue what any of it is." He gave a small laugh as Mrs. Weasley showed up at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Arthur's home, It's time for dinner." She called up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">They walked in to the kitchen to find Mr. Weasley already sitting at the table with that night's issue of the Evening Prophet. When they sat down at the table he looked over the top of his paper and said a brief "evening all" before folding the paper and setting it to the side of his bowl as Molly began to serve dinner. Harry glance at the headline of the paper, <em class="calibre9">5 more Death </em><em class="calibre9">Eaters Caught,List of know diminishes.</em> Harry let a small smile creep onto his face before turning his attention back to the conversation. It seemed that Mr. Weasley had brought home a few more Muggle contraptions, much to the chagrin of , and was excitedly describing them.</p><p class="calibre7">After dinner they retired to the family room and they all sat around discussing nothing in particular. After a couple of yawns Mr. and Mrs. Weasley decided it was time for them to go to bed, Ron agreed and they all headed up to their separate rooms.</p><p class="calibre7">When Harry walked into his room the first thing he noticed was the packages from Diagon Alley. He looked through them excitedly until he found his bag from Madam Malkins and pulled out an exquisitely wrapped package. Madam Malkin had really outdone herself. She had even put a pretty little name tag that read <em class="calibre9">F</em><em class="calibre9">rom Harry </em>on it.</p><p class="calibre7">He admired the gift for a few more second before getting up and walking across the hall to Ginny's door. He knocked quietly. And a muffled <em class="calibre9">come in</em> came through the door.</p><p class="calibre7">He opened the door to find Ginny sitting in front of her trunk, her new supplies scattered around her. She glanced up and smiled at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here I've got something for you." He said as he sat down on the floor next to her, he handed her the package and her eyes went wide.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Harry, whats that for?" She asked as she took the package from him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I just wanted to get you something nice." Harry answered as she carefully began to unwrap it.</p><p class="calibre7">After she had made her way through all the paper she slowly began to open the box. When she saw what was inside she let out a small gasp. She pulled the green robes out and admired them. She ran her hands over the silky material. She noticed something that looked like gold sewn into the material so that it shimmered in the light. They were more beautiful than she remembered, until something hit her, the reason she had put them down so hastily...<em class="calibre9">the price</em>.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked up at Harry a little heatedly "You need to return these." She said as she hastily put them back into the box.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why Gin, I bought them for you." Harry asked a little confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because they cost too much. You shouldn't have spent that much on me."</p><p class="calibre7">"But I wanted too." Harry was hurt and beginning to get frustrated. "I thought they'd look good on you, and you deserve them"</p><p class="calibre7">"It doesn't matter Harry, they were way too much and you need to return them." Her voice raised slightly as she spoke.</p><p class="calibre7">"No." was all Harry could think to say before he got up and headed down the hall to his room. He locked the door and sat on his bed.</p><p class="calibre7">How could she not like them, he just couldn't understand it. And what did it matter how much they cost? It was <em class="calibre9">his</em> gold after all and he could spend it anyway he wanted. The more he thought about it the more annoyed he became. He decided it would just be best if he went to sleep. He crawled into bed and under the covers, angry thoughts still racing in his head.</p><p class="calibre7">The next morning when he woke up, he was still upset about the way Ginny had reacted to his gift. He slowly dressed and went down the stairs to breakfast. Ginny, Ron and Mrs. Weasley were already sitting down at the table. They were two open seats one by Ginny and one by Ron. Harry shocked everyone when he sat next to Ron and gruffly began to eat his oatmeal He glanced across the table, Ginny looked like she was on the verge of tears. Harry was about to say something, but Ron interrupted.</p><p class="calibre7">"Fancy a game of Quidditch?'</p><p class="calibre7">"Sure, let's go." Harry got up, not even bothering to finish his breakfast, and he and Ron headed out the back door and down to the make-shift Quidditch pitch.</p><p class="calibre7">As the sun began to set Mrs. Weasley came outside and cheerfully beckoned the boys back down.</p><p class="calibre7">"Arthur's just owled me, he's been given a promotion and he wants to go out and celebrate!" She was nearly jumping with excitement. "I need you two to go inside and get cleaned up right away." She smiled at the boys before hurrying back to the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ron got cleaned up and dressed in their nicest, but not quite dress, robes and now sat in the family room playing a quick game of chess.</p><p class="calibre7">As the clock chimed six, Arthur arrived and quickly went upstairs to get ready.</p><p class="calibre7">When he came back down he turned to Molly. "Is everyone ready?" He quickly surveyed the room. "Where's Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre7">"She's still upstairs getting ready." Molly said as she walked to the bottom of the stairs. "Ginny!" She hollered up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">After a few moments Ginny appeared on the landing dressed in the robes from Harry. She gave him a weak smile but he just turned away.</p><p class="calibre7">He was proud to see that he was right; she did look beautiful in them, her bright red hair clashed just perfectly with the deep emerald color, And the gold thread that was weaved through the robes danced against her hair and made it look like fire.</p><p class="calibre7">After a moment Arthur spoke "You look lovely Ginny dear, now are we all ready to go?"</p><p class="calibre7">Every one nodded and then floo'd to a place Harry had never been before called the Wizards Garden. The restaurant was all out doors and overlooked a view of a large lake. The lighting was low and cast by several floating candles.</p><p class="calibre7">They walked forward to a waiter behind a small counter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Name please." He asked somewhat smugly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Weasley, party of six." Arthur answered and Harry was somewhat confused by the number until the waiter informed them that a young girl from their party was already waiting. They were lead to a large table just on the edge of the terrace overlooking the lake. Harry saw Hermione sitting at the table and gave her a quick hug before they all sat down.</p><p class="calibre7">"May I interest you in something to drink?" the waiter asked Mr. Weasley as they all began to open their menu's.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes a bottle of Elderberry wine please." The waiter summoned the drink and poured a round for all of them.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly raised her glass and gleefully said "To Arthur" they all drank to Arthur and his new promotion.</p><p class="calibre7">After they had ordered their food Arthur stood and offered a hand to Molly. "May I have this dance" She smiled and murmured <em class="calibre9">Always </em>before letting him lead her to the dance floor.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione gave Ron a look of pleading. Ron sighed but stood and took her hand before leading her to the floor.</p><p class="calibre7">Now that Harry and Ginny were left alone, He chanced a glance at her. She was staring at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," She began softly. "I'm so sorry." She sounded like she was about to cry . "I just overreacted, it's just well, I'm not used to people spending that kind of money on me." She fiddled with the edge of her napkin as she waited for him to say something but he just took another drink from his glass. "I really do like them Harry. Please say something."</p><p class="calibre7">He looked up at her. "You really hurt my feelings Ginny." He paused to let the word sink in. "I just really wanted to do something nice for you. And when I saw how much you had liked them." He took her hands in his, "I just thought you deser-" his words were cut off by Ginny who planted a passionate kiss on his lips. He let himself sink into it for a moment before remembering where they were. He pulled back and just looked at her. "Gods your beautiful." Her face went red with the famous Weasley blush as he brushed a piece of hair behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stood up and offered her his hand. "Would you like to dance?" She nodded gratefully and let him lead her over to the dance floor by Ron and Hermione. They spent the rest of the night dancing and laughing with the others. It was late when they got back to the Burrow. When Harry entered his room he noticed the Gringotts folder on the desk and realized he still hadn't looked through it. He made himself a promise that he would do it first thing tomorrow.</p>
