<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_63">*Chapter 62*: Chapter 61</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Hey look it took me less than 4 ,onths this time! lol. On that note though , I really thought I'd get to write more since my surgery, but the meds they have me on either knock me out or make me so sick I can't move. It's really and lose-lose situation.</p><p class="calibre7">If you didn't know, I had surgery late last month on my right knee. I ws performing and it dislocated. Sucks right. They had to perform a Tibial Tubercle Ostotomy ( ithink thats how its spelled). They basically cut off part of my shin bone and realligned my leg. My knee cap was 1 1/2 to the side! eww! But fun fun.</p><p class="calibre7">On a serious note, this is probally the next to last chapter for this story, I think that might be why I've been putting it off. lol. So enjoy it and review!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: Knee Surgery=BAD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Sixty-Two</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat at his desk absently mindlly doing the cross-word on the back of the Daily Prophet.</p><p class="calibre7">He gave a jump as the large brown owl landed ungracefully, and unannounced on his desk, scattering the papers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on, I had just gotten them organized." He complained as the bird gave him an unrepentant stare.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry reached out to untie the note on the leg off the bird, after which the owl promptly bit him and flew off.</p><p class="calibre7">"Stupid bird." He mumbled as he turned the letter over. He stopped abruptly, for there starring back at him was the Hogwarts crest. <em class="calibre9">Oh great</em> he thought sourly as he made his way down stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," he yelled, peering into the living room.</p><p class="calibre7">"In here," he heard her yell from the back of the house.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly made his way into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here," he said handing her the envelope. "This was just delivered."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at the letter terrified. "I'm not opening it. Besides its your turn."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his head fiercely. "Nah-ah, she sent the last one to the Ministry. Do you know how embarrassing that is?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gave a great huff. "Fine, well do it together." She stood close to Harry as she carefully broke the seal on the envelope.</p><p class="calibre7">She breathed a sigh of relief when the letter didn't immediately begin to scream at her. She pulled it out and as she began to read, her face grew into a wide grin.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Harry asked trying to look over at the letter. "What is it?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny just continued to smile. "James has made the Quidditch team."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really?" Harry said jumping at the letter. "This is getting framed and going in my office." he proclaimed loudly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, no it's not. Its going in mine." Ginny said reaching for the letter that Harry held just above her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on Harry. I'm the one who works in Qudditch." She argued.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked at her then the letter. "Yeah, but this is the first letter from Hogwarts since his acceptance that hasn't yelled at us before bursting into flames." Harry said pouting.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed. "Fine, lets see. What position is he?" she asked, her eyes bright. "If he's chaser I get it, Seeker you get it and anything else it goes on the mantle." She nodded her head, proud of her plan.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his head in acceptance as he brought the letter down to read. They scanned it quickly before Harry yelled "Ha!" loudly. "Seeker! That's third generation! Ha-ha!" he yelled as he ran up the stairs clutching the letter in his fist.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat back down at the table defeated. <em class="calibre9">Well, we still have two more kids. Maybe Lily will make the team.</em></p><p class="calibre7">The small family waited on the platform, anxiously waiting for the train to arrive.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm cold." Albus whined. "Can't I wait in the car, Not like James is going to be excited to see me anyway." He reasoned.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at her son, stunned. "What do you mean by that? I'm sure your brother has missed you very much."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, missed picking on me." Albus mumbled under his breath as the train finally pulled into the station, filling the cool air with steam.</p><p class="calibre7">Lily bounced on her toes, unlike Albus she was quite excited to have James back. They got along well and when he was home she could get away with anything. Everyone always assumed it was James.</p><p class="calibre7">She laughed to herself until she saw the top of her brothers hair come into view. Like her fathers it was always a mess, but somehow it had managed to be a weird brown color. A mixed between her mothers vibrant red and her fathers black she reckoned.</p><p class="calibre7">She pushed her way through the crowd until she finally made her way to her brother. She threw her arms around him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Missed me much Lils?" He asked laughing as he hugged her back. Lily nodded vigorously as they made their way back to their parents.</p><p class="calibre7">"Have a good semester?" Harry asked as he took hold of his son's bag and began heading to the car. He nodded absentmindedly to Bill and Fleur as they passed, listening to James tell tells of his many adventures.</p><p class="calibre7">When they reached the foyer of the house James stopped suddenly and reached into his bag. "Dad, I'd almost forgotten. Hagrid sent these. I don't know if your supposed to eat them though. I tried to once and almost broke a tooth." He reasoned as he handed a bag of what Harry recognized as Hagrid's infamous rock cakes.</p><p class="calibre7">The family sat quietly at dinner that night. Ginny had made James favorite, Pot Roast, When James suddenly turned to his father and asked seriously "I want to know about the Mauraders Map."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked shocked across the table to Ginny before gingerly setting down his fork.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now listen here," He pointed at James. "I don't know what you've heard, but there is no such thing as a Mauraders Map." He avoided James gaze as he picked up his fork again and resumed eating.</p><p class="calibre7">But James wasn't willing to give up just yet. "That's not what Uncle Ron said. Or Uncle George."</p><p class="calibre7">"Your Uncles can't always be trusted." Ginny piped in, trying to help.</p><p class="calibre7">But James smiled. "I thought you'd say that." He smiled even wider. "So I asked Professor McGonagall." Harry dropped his fork. He knew McGonagall knew about his cloak, but he racked his brain trying to remember if she had ever found out about his map. Luckily James finished.</p><p class="calibre7">"She said she didn't know, but she was pretty sure you had something like it. As much trouble as you got in." He looked pointedly at his father. "You always yell at me for getting into things, but from what I hear from Hagrid and Professor Longbottom and McGonagall, you were almost as bad as I am."</p><p class="calibre7">Lily and Albus just sat stunned, was James actually accusing their father of being a trouble maker? They both decided to keep their mouth shut in fear of being pushed out of the room and missing anything.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry cleared his throat. "Thing were different thing. I got in trouble for different reasons. Important reasons."</p><p class="calibre7">"Like what?" James smirked.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry starred at his son. He was eleven now, and Harry assumed he was old enough to handle it. He took a deep breath. "Like people trying to kill me." He sat his fork down before excusing himself from the table and heading up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">The remaining members sat in silence until Lily spoke up. "It that true?" She asked imploringly of her mother. "Did someone actually try to kill Daddy?" Ginny looked at her daughter, she was too young for this and Ginny for the life of her could not deal with it at the moment. She shook her head softly, before excusing herself from the table and heading after hair.</p><p class="calibre7">Albus turned to James after they had heard their parents bedroom door shut. "Good job James."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat on the bed, his head in his hands. When Ginny entered the room he looked up, his eyes red. "I didn't mean to tell them, I know their too young." He put his head back down as Ginny took a seat next to him on the bed, absentmindedly rubbing his back.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay Harry, James was pushing you. And really, we knew all along this day would come. Especially with James in school now. I'm mean he's sure to cover it in History of Magic."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up and smiled. "Well with the way Professor Binns teaches, there was always the hope that James wouldn't be paying attention."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled back at Harry, before becoming serious once again. "We do have to figure out what were going to tell them. I mean, James and Albus know part of the story, but Lily knows nothing." She shook her head slowly, how did you explain something like this to your children.</p><p class="calibre7">"We'll give Lily the book we gave James and Albus. That's all she needs to know for now." Harry shook his head, who would have every thought that the ridiculous storybooks written about him would have been helpful. "As for Albus I'll explain to him, like I did James, that he's still to young to know everything. Answer any questions he has."</p><p class="calibre7">He took a deep breath. "And as for James, well I guess it's time he knew the truth." Ginny reluctantly nodded. It was a sad day when your children grew up.</p><p class="calibre7">Later that evening after the Potter children were bathed and waiting in bed, Harry entered James room. James starred at his father, wide-eyed. He started speaking suddenly, scarred. "Dad I didn't mean it. I mean, I didn't mean to make you tell me that. Not in front of Lily and Al. I'm so sorry." he rushed out as he looked t his father, guilty.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed as he sat on the edge of his eldest son's bed. "It's okay James, I understand you have questions and I should have told you before you left for school." He took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair. "I guess I should start at the beginning..."</p><p class="calibre7">James entered the kitchen the next morning to find his father at the stove. Harry looked over at the sound of footfalls and smiled as James took a seat at the table. "Eggs will be done any second." James nodded silently. After what his father had told him last night, well he didn't know exactly how to process it. He had always wondered why his dad was such a good cook. He shook his head. It hurt to think such things. He looked up at his father as a plate of eggs was set in front of him. He didn't know if he would ever look at him the same way again. He had know most of his life that his father had defeated some bad wizard when he was younger, but thats what his father did everyday. That's what the Aurors were there for. But until last night he had never understood, why this bad wizard was so different. He shook his head again before taking a bite of his eggs.</p><p class="calibre7">Things seemed lighter in the Potter household after James had been told the full story. He tried, somewhat, to behave for his parents until one morning, his resolve broke.</p><p class="calibre7">James slowly tiptoed through the upstairs hall. He carefully opened the door to his fathers office, making sure once again that no one was watching as he slipped in.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where are you?" he asked aloud, surveying the room. He began quickly opening drawers and rummaging through them, but found nothing.</p><p class="calibre7">He was about to give up and try another time when he pulled on the bottom drawer of the desk. It didn't open</p><p class="calibre7">James smiled widely and pulled out his wand. He muttered a quick spell, he'd deal with the repercussions of doing magic later, and the drawer opened a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked down and there it was. He lifted it carefully from its resting place, and for a moment he almost kissed it.</p><p class="calibre7">Uncle Ron had told him about this. Supposedly his Grandfather Potter had made it with his friends while they were in Hogwarts. Then by some leap of fate Uncle Fred and George had gotten it and given it to his Dad.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly opened the seemingly blank parchment.</p><p class="calibre7">After his little conversation with Uncle Ron he had quickly set out to question his Uncle George who, after a few firewhisky's, had answered all his questions.</p><p class="calibre7">He muttered the incantation. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good." He watched in amazement as the outline of Hogwarts castle appeared before him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Awesome." He squeaked out. He was still staring intently at the map when he heard Albus calling from downstairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mischief managed" he whispered before shoving the map unceremoniously into his back pocket. He hated sharing with his brother and he wasn't about to start now.</p><p class="calibre7">A few days later Harry and Ginny sat at the breakfast table.</p><p class="calibre7">"My maps missing." Harry said as he lifted a forkful of eggs into his mouth.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really? Which one?" Ginny asked not looking up from her paper.</p><p class="calibre7">"You know which one, and I'm pretty sure I know who took it."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked up and smiled. "Well he is your son."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just nodded gruntly before going back to his food.</p>
