			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/n: This is the next year, august-ish, I know, I know I jumped a bit. But w/e just letting you know Teddy is now 3 and almost a half. Lol. And sorry this is so short, but it the second one today, so hey!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">And now to answer some questions:</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">As for Percy's baby, yep. It's canon. Just though you should know. Lol.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">For how long this story will continue, I actually have a few chapters written for James Hogwarts days already, lol. So just letting you know...te-he.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Read and Review!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Don't own Harry Potter!!</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Ginny walked into the flat, a large green dress bag draped over her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry." she called as she made her way through the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"In here." he called from the office.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you doing?" she asked as she sat the bag in the lounge chair and walked over to his side of the desk.</p><p class="calibre7">"I just had so much paper work today, had to bring some home with me." he groaned as he flipped over a piece of parchment and started writing on the back. "Probably be here all bloody night." he ran his hand through his hair.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shifted uncomfortably on her heels.</p><p class="calibre7">"Was there something you need Gin?" Harry said looking up and tapping his quill against the desk.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh well. I, it's. Nothing, Don't worry about it." she scooped up the bag and headed for the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin," Harry grabbed her arm, she hadn't even heard him get up from the chair. "seriously, what is it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing, I can show you later. You've got more important things." she said making for the door again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," Harry said sitting in the lounge chair and pulling her down with him. "What's in the bag?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, okay." she smiled as she turned in the chair to face him. "when I showed up at practice today and went to change, I noticed something was wrong with my uniform and practice gear." she slightly unzipped the bag. "so they sent me to the team tailor to fix them." she pulled out the green robes and held them out to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">He carefully took them and ran his finger across the white letters upon the back. Where once it bore the name Weasley, was Potter. He smiled, "This is awesome, Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well they kind of had to change them you know." she laughed. "but they didn't have to do this." she reached into the bag again pulled out a small jersey. "I had them make this for Teddy." she smiled again as she handed it to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">On front of the small jersey was the regular Holyhead logo, but on the back above Ginny team number was 'Teddy' in the same print as Ginny's uniform.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, he's going to love this." Harry said holding the jersey up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I figured he's getting older. Maybe he can wear it to opening day." she smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"That sound awesome Gin." harry said as he kissed her lightly.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy bounced on his heels excitedly. He couldn't see anything, the man in front of him insisted on wearing a tall cap that obstructed his view.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uncle Harry?" he said tugging at Harry's sleeve. "Will you trade me seats. I cant see." he emphasized the last word, <em class="calibre9">maybe the man would get the hint and take off the hat.</em></p><p class="calibre7">Harry sighed but traded seats with Teddy anyway. <em class="calibre9">Damn it, now I can't see.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"I'm hungry." Teddy exclaimed a few minutes into the second half of the game.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really?" Harry asked, briefly taking his eyes off the field, the game was tied and he really didn't want to miss any of it.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"You cant wait? Just a few more minutes?"</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy slumped back in his seat. "I'm starving." he held his stomach dramatically. "Need. Food. Now." he slid onto the stadium floor.</p><p class="calibre7">"Teddy." Harry said sternly looking beneath the seats. "Get back up here."</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy popped his head up, "I'm hungry." he pouted again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Fine, lets go" Harry sighed defeated, heading toward the concession.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stopped at the end of the long line and groaned when the crowd began cheering. "ugh what did I miss."</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, I'm here with you." Teddy answered.</p><p class="calibre7">"It was rhetorical." Harry muttered under his breath.</p><p class="calibre7">A few minutes later the line had barely moved and Teddy was bouncing erratically.</p><p class="calibre7">"Teddy, stand still. Just for a minute."</p><p class="calibre7">"But I'm hunnnngrryy." he stressed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know, but I cant make the line go any faster." Harry shook his head. "Do you even know what you want?" he asked taking a small step forward.</p><p class="calibre7">"A hot dog. And chips." he paused to think. "and a butterbeer." he smiled cheekily.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah ha, I don't think so mister. How bout a juice."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ugh," Teddy stuck out his tongue. "I hate juice." he crossed his arms defiantly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, how about a soda?"</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy sighed, "I guess so."</p><p class="calibre7">They finally received their food and made their way back to the seats.</p><p class="calibre7">"All better?" Harry asked as Teddy scarfed down his food.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy nodded, not missing a beat. <em class="calibre9">He's spending way to much time with Ron. </em>Harry thought as he watched the small boy eat.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry turned his attention back to the field just as the crowd erupted into cheers again, he searched the field to see what had happened, only for his eyes to come upon the Holyhead seeker, fist raised high in the air.</p><p class="calibre7">"Teddy said he really enjoyed the game." Ginny said as she changed into her night clothes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, sure he did." Harry mumbled. "Missed the entire bloody match."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Ginny laughed as she slipped into the bed next to him. "I'm sorry, if it helps I didn't play my best." she giggled.</p><p class="calibre7">"No that doesn't help.</p><p class="calibre7">"Good, because I lied, I played really excellent today." she laughed as she snuggled next to him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your hilarious Gin." Harry said as he turned off the light.</p>
