<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_12">*Chapter 11*: Chapter 11</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: I had plans to get this up first thing this morning, but then i came down with a sinus cold. kinda sucks. okay now a note on this next chapter. in parts it kinda cheesy. lol. but i feel at this point in their relationship they are still completely infatuated with each other. lol. let me know if you like this type of scene, then i can add more or less accordingly. lol</strong>Chapter Eleven</p><p class="calibre7">He really didn't know how he was so lucky. All he seemed to know right now was Ginny. The way she felt pressed against him. The way she looked in the dim light of the broom closet they had found, and currently occupied. He stopped kissing her for a moment and pushed his face into the crook of her neck. He fisted his hand in her hair and brought it up to him. He inhaled deeply. He loved the smell of Ginny. The deep scent of wood and the light flowery scent of something he could not exactly place. He would have to ask her what it was, because it drove him insane. He pulled back to look at her, she eyed him wildly.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked deeply into her eyes "do you know how much I love you?" she looked down shyly, her hair falling into her face. He tilted her chin upwards so he could look her in the eyes again. "Ginny I love you so much." he gave her a small kiss "I don't even know how to explain it, I feel like…like I'm going to burst." he gave her a small smile and a laugh. He looked down at his watch. "Come on we better go, it's an hour past curfew."</p><p class="calibre7">He gripped her hand tightly and slowly began to open the closet door. He peered down the hall in both directions. It was deserted. He turned back to Ginny. "Coast is clear."</p><p class="calibre7">They slowly made their way out of the closet and started down the hall, they were almost to the Portrait of the Fat Lady when they heard and all too familiar meowing sound. They didn't even have time to register what had happened before Filtch came bounding down the hall yelling, "I've got you now!"</p><p class="calibre7">Detention wasn't as bad as Harry had expected. In a lapse of judgment, Filtch had actually set Ginny and Harry together to work on the same task, cleaning the trophy room.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up from the large trophy he had been cleaning; he wiped the sweat from his brow and looked over at Ginny. <em class="calibre9">Gods she is beautiful</em>. She was on the opposite side of the room hunched over, furiously scrubbing at a trophy base that refused to come clean, he laughed to himself. He was on the brink of losing his self-control when Filtch walked in and reluctantly announced that their punishment was over. They walked in comfortable silence back up to the common room. Once inside Harry sat by the fire in his favorite chair. He couldn't help smiling when Ginny placed herself on his lap and wrapped her arms around his neck. He reached up and gave her a soft kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you know how unbelievably sexy you looked cleaning those trophies?" he asked her after he had pulled away.</p><p class="calibre7">"No I don't, but I know you didn't look all that bad yourself Potter."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really" he replied, his voice deep, as he began to run his hands up and down her sides.</p><p class="calibre7">She nodded before she dipped her head to kiss him. Instead of the small kiss she intended to give him, she quickly found it intensifying. Harry was pulling her deeper and deeper into him. He held her close and turned in the chair to give them more room. She soon found his hands slipping to her waist and tugging at the hem of her t-shirt. If her mind would have been in a rational state she would have stopped him, but right now, all thoughts were clouded by the essence that was Harry. She gasped a little when his hands touched her skin, like before it felt so right, the contrast of his rough hands. She had only felt him touch her there a few times and she had already learned to love it. She unknowably let out a low, throaty moan. She felt Harry's hands slip slowly up her back until they encountered the clasp of her bra. She could feel him fumbling with it for a few moments and his mouth stopped moving as he focused all his energy on the tiny little clasp that he just couldn't seem to get apart.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin.." he whined and Ginny let out a low laugh before sitting up and reaching around to undo the inapt piece of clothing. She smiled down at a wide-eyed Harry before leaning down again to recapture his mouth. She moaned as his hands snaked their way up her shirt sliding against her stomach and stopping just below her breast.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin" Harry breathed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Umm" Ginny moaned momentarily lifting her lips from Harry's.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, are you sure this is ok?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moaned again, and nodded. That's all Harry needed. He slowly moved his hand up to cup Ginny's breast, it was soft and warm and everything, yet nothing he had expected it to be. He squeezed gently and was startled when Ginny's mouth left his and moaned deeply. "Harry." he looked up at her, eyes closed and breathing heavily. She brought her hand up to where his was under her shirt she pressed hard and manipulated his hand to kneed her breast.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh gin…" Harry moaned. "Oh gods Ginny."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny opened her eyes and looked down at Harry. He met her soft gaze and bit his lower lip. Ginny slowly raised her hands to his tie and began to loosen it. Her hands started to fumble with the top button before Harry's hands flew up to cover her own.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, as much as I really, really want to." he looked down her body and was lost for a minute before shaking his head and looking her in the eye again. "We can't do anything down here, someone could easily walk in on us." he downcast his eyes and Ginny knew he was right. If someone walked in on them doing anything, not only would they be in deep trouble but also it would most likely somehow find its way to the <em class="calibre9">Daily Prophet. </em>She was just about to give in to defeat when a thought popped in to her head. It was utterly brilliant, and she smiled slyly. She bent her head to whisper in to Harry's ear. "Well then let's go somewhere else." she gave him a wicked smile before getting up and walking to the bottom of the staircase leading to the boys dormitory. She looked back over her shoulder at Harry still seated on the couch. "You coming?" she asked before taking another step. Harry hesitated another moment before he jumped from the couch and scooped Ginny up in his arms carrying her up to his dorm room.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry paused at his dorm room door and held a finger up to his lips and lets out a small "shh" before opening the door. All of his dorm mates were asleep, from where he stood he could see Ron hanging off his bed slightly, and could hear the muffled snores of Neville, Dean and Seamus. After the past year when muggle born and half bloods were unable to attend, they were offered special invitations to return to the school and continue their educations. Harry stepped lightly into the room and made his way to his bed. He laid Ginny down gently before removing his trainers and climbing onto the bed himself. Ginny had to stifle a giggle as Harry hurriedly closed the drapes and lay down next to her.</p><p class="calibre7">"So" he whispered raising his eyebrows suggestively. "What did you have in mind?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I don't know" Ginny said as softly as she could while holding back her laughter. She lifted herself to straddled Harry and gave him a quick kiss. As she looked down at him, she realized how much she truly did love him, and before she knew it, her hands were unbuttoning his shirt and sliding it off his shoulders. Harry sat up a little, slipped the shirt from his arms, and dropped it beside the bed. He looked back at Ginny, his eyes full of desire and love for the girl, <em class="calibre9">no women </em>in front of him. He slowly reached for her top button, but paused and looked to her for reassurance. She gave him and small nod, and he slowly began to undo her shirt. With each button more and more of her porcelain skin was relieved marked only by a few fair freckles here and there. He was amazed at her beauty and by the time he undid the last button, he was unable to speak, he could only gaze at the woman in front of him and wonder how someone like her could love someone like him. Ginny turned away from his stare and blushed. She slipped her arms out of her shirt and slid off her bra before dropping them on the floor with Harry's. She turned back to Harry to find him still staring at her intently.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" she said a little more loudly than she had meant to.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing." Harry said startled out of his ravine. "You're just…so beautiful." He waited a moment before lifting his hands to tangle them in her hair. He pulled her down and kissed her reverently. After a few moments, he slid his tongue against her lower lip. She opened her mouth and he could feel the warm flesh of her own against his.</p><p class="calibre7">As their tongues clashed, Harry ran his hands down Ginny's bare back until he came to the top of her skirt. He knew he should stop, should not press his luck. But she'd let him do so much tonight and really he could not help himself. He slid his hands down to cup her bum and was disappointed when she abruptly sat up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry" she started. <em class="calibre9">Damn to far, I knew I shouldn't have pressed my luck. </em>"I'm sorry Gin," he said with a an apologetic look.</p><p class="calibre7">"No Harry it's not that it, it's just." she looked down and blushed.</p><p class="calibre7">"What is it Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">"I just don't think I'm ready for sex." her face turned, if possible even redder with her last confession.</p><p class="calibre7">"That's ok Gin." <em class="calibre9">in fact it's more than ok</em>. It's not that he didn't want to have sex with her it was just that he didn't think he was ready himself, there was still a lot about it he didn't quite understand. "I don't think I'm ready either.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really?" Gin looked up smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, really. How bout for now we just keep the knickers on ok?"</p><p class="calibre7">"That's more than ok." and she leaned down to undo his belt buckle.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin what are you doing?" Harry asked surprised.</p><p class="calibre7">"What you didn't say anything about pants." she giggled before going back to the task at hand.</p><p class="calibre7">And that was her mistake.</p>
