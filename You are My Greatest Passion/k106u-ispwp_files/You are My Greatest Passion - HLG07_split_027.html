<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_28">*Chapter 27*: Chapter 27</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: I am just going to say enjoy
and please review. Also if you want the smutty chapters up anytime
soon, go vote on the poll on my profile. Thanks!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Uber Long
Chapter=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p class="calibre7">"I tell you to take things slow
and you ask her to move in?" Ron nearly shouted.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shhh" Harry said leading Ron
outside. "She hasn't told your mum yet."</p><p class="calibre7">Ron's face brightened. "Oh."</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mums going to murder you. Oh, I
want to see this." He turned and bolted back towards the house;
Harry sighed and ran to catch up. When they arrived at the back door,
they could see Ginny sitting at the kitchen table with Molly and
Arthur.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think your Dad might be
expecting it, he walked in on a rather heavy snogging session a while
ago."</p><p class="calibre7">Ron looked at Harry and laughed
before turning his attention back to the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum, Dad," Ginny said as she
stirred her tea nervously. "With the Harpies I'm not going to be
here much you know that right?" she looked up to them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes dear, you explained that to
us when you got accepted." Molly said, unsure of where this
conversation was heading.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, it's a really long way to
apparate from out here to Holyhead, so I was thinking of moving to
somewhere closer. Like Diagon alley."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well that makes sense," Arthur
told his youngest child. "And you can always visit when you're
not out."</p><p class="calibre7">"So your okay with me moving out?"
Ginny asked stunned. Her parent's nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"We only want what's best for
you," Molly said rubbing Ginny's hand delicately.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Okay now the kicker.</em> "Good
because Harry has asked me to move in with him." She shut her mouth
quickly and looked down at her cup.</p><p class="calibre7">After a few moments of silence, she
looked up. Her Mum looked furious and her Dad looked calm, almost as
if it had not been a surprise.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginevra Molly Weasley," <em class="calibre9">oh
no here it comes.</em> "You plan to move in with him before your
married?" Molly asked, as if even the sheer idea would harm her.</p><p class="calibre7">"But Mum, we've already
determined that I wouldn't even be there half the time." <em class="calibre9">Just
sleeping really, but no need to tell her that.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"And Harry has an extra room he's
willing to let you use?" Molly asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny winced. "Uh, no not exactly.
It more of sharing the same room." She braced herself for her
Mother's next raid.</p><p class="calibre7">"You plan to share a bed?" Molly
shrieked. "Just because I taught you that potion doesn't mean I
was giving you free reign!" Molly yelled. But Ginny looked up.<em class="calibre9">
Potion? Oh maybe it is a really good thing Brianna walked in.</em></p><p class="calibre7">She turned her attention back to her
mother. "Were not having sex." <em class="calibre9">Yet. </em>"If you don't
believe me, we can go down to and have them run a test."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly looked at her daughter and
sighed in frustration. "You're not changing your mind are you?"
she asked quietly and Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"Will you just be careful? And
possibly discreet?" molly asked quietly. Ginny nodded and walked
over to hug her parents.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, Harry you can stop listening
by the door." Molly hollered, and the two boys walked shamefully
into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly looked pointedly at Harry.
"I'm too young for her to make me a grandmother. You hear me."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just nodded before he sat next
to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stepped out of the floo with
two more boxes, which he immediately set down. "There I think
that's the last of it." He called out to Ginny who was unpacking
boxes in the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry do you realize you have
nothing?" she said looking around. "I mean for god sake your
using boxes as your night stand."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah about that, I meant to go
buy furniture. I really did, I just never got around to it." He ran
his hand through his hair. "You wouldn't want to help me pick
some things out, would you?" he looked up hopefully.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled up at him, "Why how
domestic." They shared a laugh before Ginny got up off the floor
and they headed out into Diagon alley.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"I like the white one." Harry
said.</p><p class="calibre7">"White is just not practical for a
couch Harry. You'll have it a day before it gets stained."</p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">We'll </em>have it a day. And
can't I just do a spell to get the stain out?" Harry asked
confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"There are something's even
magic can't get out; Mum found that out the hard way." Ginny
laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"The twins?" Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"What about blue?" Ginny asked
trying to turn him away from the bright white couch he was so fond
of.</p><p class="calibre7">"It okay, I guess."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed. "What about beige?
It's almost white. It's like a healthy compromise."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked the couch over. "Okay,
it will do." He grabbed the ticket, Ginny's hand and headed for
the counter.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Four hours later they reentered the
small apartment, after getting the shopping done they had stopped for
a small dinner at the leaky cauldron.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry yawned. "I think I'm going
to get a shower then hit the sack, I've got to be up early
tomorrow." He stretched before heading towards the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked around the apartment,
it was her first night alone with Harry and she was a bit nervous.
She sorted through one of her boxes until she found her clothes. She
slipped into the thin pants and shirt before sitting on the bed. She
looked down at herself.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Maybe I should wear something
else.</em> She shook her head to try to shake her insecurities.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked up when she heard the
bathroom door open, Harry walked into the bedroom, a towel around his
waist.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled at Ginny as he opened the
closet and pulled out a pair of night pants. He dropped the towel and
quickly slipped into them. However, even the small glimpse of his bum
had caused Ginny's face to blush furiously.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry turned around and got into the
bed. "Are you planning on sleeping above the covers?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh no, I guess not." Ginny said
nervously as she slid beneath the blankets. Harry quickly turned out
the lights. When she was completely under the covers, Harry closed
his eyes and wrapped an arm around Ginny, pulling her so that her
back was against him. He slowly kissed her neck, "Ginny, I love
you." He breathed in her ear.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too." She answered
nervously.</p><p class="calibre7">"See you in the morning." Harry
said before he buried his face in her hair and nodded off to sleep.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laid there, Harry wrapped
around her, and willed her heart to slow down so that she could get
some sort of sleep.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p><p class="calibre7">When Ginny woke up the next morning,
Harry was gone. She looked over at the bedside clock. <em class="calibre9">Ten am. Gods
I slept long. The furniture will be here soon!</em> She jumped out of
bed and grabbed clean clothes before heading to the shower.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~**~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was levitating the last piece
of furniture into place when Hermione came through the floo. She
nearly bumped into Ginny on her way out.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hermione, what are you doing
here?" Ginny asked surprised.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione looked nervous. "You
haven't seen the Prophet this morning have you?" Ginny shook her
head and Hermione held up a folded paper.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at the paper carefully
and gasped with surprise, there on the cover was a picture of her and
Harry's 'reunion' at the quidditch game. The when the photo
played you could clearly see Harry's tongue slipping into her mouth
and his hand moving to cup her bum before they apparated out of view.
Ginny moved back to fall onto the couch. Hermione came over to sit by
her. "Are you okay?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shook her head, and then
popped up. "Maybe there is still time, I just have to make sure my
Mum or Dad doesn't see a copy of this." She got off the couch
with a new determination.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," Hermione called with
dejection from her place on the couch, Ginny slowly turned to face
her. "I saw your dad walking with a copy this morning."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny plopped back down on the
couch. "Maybe it's a good thing I moved." Ginny said as she put
her head in her hands. "Oh goodness, she going to send a howler."
The something hit her. "Has harry seen this yet?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know I haven't seen
him today." Hermione replied.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh what if she sends him one at
the ministry, she'd do something like that you know."Ginny got up
from the couch. "Sorry to run out on you, but I've got to warn
Harry. Oh." She stopped right before stepping into the floo. "Can
I have that paper?" Hermione handed it over willingly before Ginny
stepped into the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny walked quickly through the
atrium, and was annoyed when the security wizard insisted that she
check her wand. She finally made her way up to the Auror offices, she
noticed a few people starring at her before they quickly turned away,
only to whisper to someone else and look at her again.</p><p class="calibre7">She reached the reception desk.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hello," she said as nicely as
she could at the present time. "I'm looking for Auror Potter's
office." She said adding a smile for good measure.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you have an appointment?"
the witch asked without looking up from her nails that she was busily
polishing.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do I need one?" Ginny asked
slightly annoyed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes." The witch replied,
blowing on her nails to dry them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Can't you just call his office
and see if he's busy."</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm really not supposed to."
She replied smugly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Can't you do it just this one
time?" Ginny pleaded.</p><p class="calibre7">"I could, but we are really only
supposed to allow family and close relations back, and I don't know
that you're either one." She said moving to her other hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you kidding me?" Ginny
yelled. "Have you seen the paper this morning?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, nothing of interest." The
witch said looking Ginny straight in the eye and smiling cockily.
"Potter snogging a random girl." she sighed. "Would you like to
make an appointment? I'm sure I could make one for oh say, next
month."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry was in his office filling out
the last of a stack of papers for a recent case when he heard an all
to familiar shriek.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Oh no</em>. he jumped up from his
chair and ran down the hall to the reception area, where it looked
like Ginny was about to jump across the counter and attack the
reception witch.</p><p class="calibre7">He quickly grabbed Ginny around the
waist, and hauled her back into his office, giving an apologetic look
to the others who had came into the area to see what was going on.</p><p class="calibre7">When they entered the small office,
he let go of Ginny and locked the door. She took a seat in one of the
oversized chairs across from his desk.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't pay her any mind; she can
be quite a bitch." He said motioning towards the reception area.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny crossed her arms over her
chest. "You should have let me hit her."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, but then that would be more
paperwork for me to fill out." Harry said as he sorted out the
papers on his desk. He sat down, "what brings you down here Gin?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny uncrossed her arms, "Did you
see the prophet this morning?" she asked tentatively.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded before he sat down.
"Yeah wasn't the best, was it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I thought I'd warn you in case
Mum sent you a howler."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry picked up the trashcan and
brought it over to Ginny. She could clearly see the scorched remains
of a letter in the bottom.</p><p class="calibre7">"It was waiting for me when I got
here." Harry said putting the can back down. "She didn't send
you one?" he asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hmm," he said thoughtfully.
"Well I guess it was my hand and my tongue so…" he trailed off.</p><p class="calibre7">"harry." Ginny snapped her
fingers as she got up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Huh? Oh yeah." He said as he
turned his chair to face her as she came around the desk. "Sorry, I
let my mind wander." He looked up and down her body before licking
his lips. "You know Ginny," he took her hands in his and set them
on his shoulders. "This is a private office." He wrapped his arms
around her waist.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh really?" Ginny asked
playfully. "And what do suggest we do?"</p><p class="calibre7">She moved to sit facing him in his
lap before kissing his neck. She moved her hands down to his belt
buckle and quickly undid it, stroking him softly through his boxers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Ginny," Harry moaned into
her ear, "Oh, I like that." He said as she slipped him out of
his boxers and fully into her hand.</p><p class="calibre7">Suddenly there was a knock, before
Harry's office door opened. Ginny quickly slid forward to help
conceal the fact that Harry'S penis was currently out in the open.</p><p class="calibre7">The reception witch entered with a
stack of papers. When she looked up and seen the position Harry and
Ginny were in she made a disgusted face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, here are the papers from that
last case."</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks you Sophia." Harry
replied quickly.</p><p class="calibre7">She gave one last sickened look at
Ginny before shutting the door.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't think she likes me very
much." Ginny said after the door was shut.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well you were about to
punch her." Harry laughed before he looked at his watch. "Oh
crap, Ginny I have to go meet with Williamson real quick." He ran
his hands up her thighs. "Wait here for me?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded as she got of Harry's
lap and went around to sit in one of the comfy chairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't forget to zip them."
She told Harry as he put himself back into his pants.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks." He said as he grabbed
his papers and gave her a kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny watched as he exited the
office.</p><p class="calibre7">She sat there for a few moments,
quietly surveying the office. She noticed the picture on Harry's
desk and went over to see what it was. When she saw her own face
blushing back at her, she scowled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uhh, I need to get him a
different picture." She went around to sit in his chair. She let
it lean back a bit and closed her eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"And who may I ask are you?" an
unfamiliar voice brought Ginny out of her daze. She opened her eyes
to see a short, balding middle-aged man in Burgundy robes standing in
the middle of Harry's office.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm, I'm." She stammered,
quickly standing. "Im Ginny."</p><p class="calibre7">"And what are you doing in Auror
Potter's office?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Im waiting for Harry to get
back." She answered, she was starting to worry that she was in
trouble.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't you mean Auror Potter?"
he asked seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes," she stammered. She
guessed they did not go on a first name basis here.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh really?" He crossed his
arms and eyed Ginny suspiciously. "You wouldn't happen to be
related to Arthur, are you?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Weasley?" she asked quietly,
the man nodded. "I'm his daughter."</p><p class="calibre7">The short man nodded and stood
silent again. A moment later, to Ginny's relief Harry walked
through the door with a thumbing through a stack of papers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," he said as he nearly ran
into the short man. "Sorry Clowes didn't see you there." He
moved and set the papers neatly on his desk. He looked at Ginny who
was once again sitting in his chair looking nervous.</p><p class="calibre7">"What's wrong? Did Sophia give
you any more trouble?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No," Ginny answered quickly,
diverting her eyes back to the other Auror.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, yeah." Harry said finally
noticing Ginny's nervousness." Clowes, this is my girlfriend
Ginny Weasley. Ginny this is Auror Clowes, he has just taken
Kingsley's old position as Head of the department." Harry said
before sitting in one of the oversized chairs.</p><p class="calibre7">The short man who had been so
serious and frightening all this time, laughed before moving to sit
in the other chair. "She looks so much like Arthur, it's a bit
peculiar."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny just looked at him confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I'm sorry dear," Clowes
said when he saw her expression. "I went to Hogwarts with your
parents, was great friends with your father."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well then why haven't I met you
before?" Ginny asked accusingly. She had met all of her parents
close friends.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I transferred to America
when all that rubbish about the 'Dark Lord' came about.
Voldemort, ha. Too much trouble for me." He laughed and she noticed
Harry visibly wince when Clowes patted his shoulder. "Good thing
this young lad took care of him, finally able to come home to good
ole Britain." He smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well," he said getting up.
"I've got work to do. Which reminds me. Potter get back to work,
no fooling around!" he laughed loudly. "Ha- no seriously, great
to meet you Ginny. Have a 'nice' time." He raised his eyebrows
suggestively before exiting the room.</p><p class="calibre7">After he left Harry buried his face
in his hands. "And that," he motioned towards the door, "was my
boss." He said, and Ginny could hear the laughter in his voice.</p>
