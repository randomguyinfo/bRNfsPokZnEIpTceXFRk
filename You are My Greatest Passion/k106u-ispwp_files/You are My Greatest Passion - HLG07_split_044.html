<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_45">*Chapter 44*: Chapter 44</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: as to the question where are
they in France, I have no clue. I live in Florida and have never been
out of the US. Lol, thus I know nothing about the geography of the
country.</p><p class="calibre7">OMGOMGOMG. I hate openoffice. This
is the third chapter I've had to re-write because it didn't save. And
well there just not as good when I re-do them. Lol. So I apologize.
Read and Review! Thanks</p><p class="calibre7">Disclaimer: I don't own Harry
Potter, or working copy of MS Word. Boo. But if I did own Harry
Potter, I could probably buy a new copy. Lol.</p><p class="calibre7">. Chapter Forty-Four</p><p class="calibre7">"Gods harry, that was absolutely
amazing!" Ginny nearly cried.</p><p class="calibre7">"It was pretty neat." Harry said
as they stepped off the Eiffel tower lift. He wrapped an arm around
her shoulders. "What should we do now?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Lets go get some dinner. Eww,
maybe we can see a show too." She bounced on her heels, tugging at
Harry's hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sound good. What do you want to
see."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, I hadn't got that far."
She laughed as she blushed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well lets walk and see what we
pass." He once again wrapped an arm around her and they turned onto
the Boulevard. They paused at several show signs, but nothing caught
their interest.</p><p class="calibre7">"What about that one?" Ginny
said brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I guess so." Harry said looking
the brightly colored sign over before turning to read the twinkling
marquee lights.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat towards the front and
ordered their food as they waited for the show to start. When the
curtain rose and Harry took in the attire of the performers, he
leaned over to Ginny. "Gin, what type of show is this?" he said
not taking his eyes off of the dancers.</p><p class="calibre7">"it's a Cabaret Show. Why?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I've never see so many boobs in
my life."He said in all seriousness. Ginny laughed as Harry's eyes
followed the bouncing breast off stage.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny strolled down the
street arm and arm.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I have to admit, that was
quite interesting." Harry said running a hand through his hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, very...cultural." Ginny
laughed as they turned down the street towards the villa's.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry waved his wand over the handle
and the lock opened.</p><p class="calibre7">"So are you ready to head home?"
Harry asked slipping out of his shoes.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, not really." She said
looking around the room, "This week has been so great, and peaceful
too." She added as she took a seat next to the fire place.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I wish we could stay longer
too. If I didn't have to be back I work…" he trailed off
shrugging his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know." Ginny said softly as
he came over to sit on the arm of her chair. "I love you Ginny."
He said playing with a piece of her hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know." She said as she smiled
up at him. "and I love you too."</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you sure you have
everything?" Harry asked as Ginny handed him her suitcase.</p><p class="calibre7">"I am next to positive." She
said smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">"Next to positive, why can't you
be positive?"</p><p class="calibre7">"well because I didn't see my
blue jumper in there, but I'm sure it is…somewhere." She said
looking around the room. Harry just laughed as he sent the cases to
the flat.</p><p class="calibre7">"So were going to your Mum's
first?" he asked, turning to face her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. "Yeah, she said our
first night back we need a good home cooked meal" she rolled her
eyes. "You know she planning something."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded as he took Ginny's
hand. "Well, lets not be late for that home cooked meal, with your
brother's there might not be anything left."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded, "Speaking of
brothers, weren't some of them rather upset about my 'virtue'
when we left?" Ginny asked smirking at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yeah, forgot about that."
Harry said just before the portkey sweep them away.</p><p class="calibre7">They landed with a thud in the back
yard of the Burrow. As Harry stood dusting of his pants, he noticed
a familiar bushy-haired figure walking towards them.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione engulfed them in a hug when
she reached them.</p><p class="calibre7">"How was France?" she asked
excitedly. "Did you see all the historic landmarks?" she was
nearly bouncing.</p><p class="calibre7">"I saw boobs." Harry spoke up
and Hermione gave him a distasteful look.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny waved his comment off. "What
he meant was we went to the Moulin Rouge." She laughed as Hermione
still gave him a motherly look.</p><p class="calibre7">"We also saw the Roman Ruins"
Ginny said, hoping to steer Hermione's attention away from Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh goodness, aren't they
amazing? The pure historical values behind them, I mean they were
built in 36 BC and…" Ginny stopped listening long enough to see
Harry make a mad dash for the house.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wow, Hermione thats amazing."
she interrupted when Hermione took time to breath. "Waybe you can
tell me about it...later." she smiled sweetly before bolting for
the house.</p><p class="calibre7">When she entered a great number of
her brothers were sitting around the kitchen table and Harry was
standing oddly close to Molly, almost as if she was keeping him safe.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed as she took a seat
next to Charlie .</p><p class="calibre7">She looked around and noticed her
brothers looking at her oddly. "What?" she asked irritated.</p><p class="calibre7">"Its, weird." Charlie said, his
brow furrowed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Whats weird."</p><p class="calibre7">"The though of you, having...gods
I cant even bring myself to say it."</p><p class="calibre7">"What, sex? "</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't say that word. Your
supposed to be my innocent little sister. Your not supposed to do
that type of stuff." he said disgusted.</p><p class="calibre7">The smile that crossed Ginny's face,
was one worthy of the twins when they were concocting some brilliant
prank.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Charlie," she leaned close
to him. "you don't want to hear how me and Harry shagged all night
long." she drew out the last bit slowly.</p><p class="calibre7">Across the kitchen Harry blushed as
Charlie quickly jumped up from his chair and went over to stand by
Bill. "Stop it Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled brightly, "Oh come on
Charlie," she started to make her way towards him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Look what you've done now,"
Bill said angrily to Charlie. "you've brought her over here." he
pushed Charlie towards Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">Charlie glanced at Ginny, before
bounding up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wait Charlie," Ginny called as
she ran after him. "you haven't heard the best part," the rest
listened as Ginny chased Charlie farther up the stairs. "His penis
is as big as...Ouch that was my nose." Ginny cried as a door
slammed.</p><p class="calibre7">She slowly made her way down the
stairs and into the kitchen to take her seat, holding her nose but
smiling nonetheless.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry made his way over to stand
behind her. "So Gin, whats it as big as?" he smirked.</p><p class="calibre7">"I would hope you'd know." Ron
laughed from beside them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, but sometimes it nice to
get a, second opinion." Harry laughed as he kissed the top of
Ginny's head.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly was placing the last dish on
the table when Percy entered with Audrey in tow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hello everyone." he greeted as
he pulled out a chair for Audrey then himself.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sorry were late but we have new
for you all."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly sat her fork down and looked
at Percy. "Go on dear."</p><p class="calibre7">Percy cleared his throat. "Me and
Audrey have decided to consummate out love and thus increase the size
of our family." he looked at brothers, stopping at Ron who looked
confused. "Were having a baby."</p>
