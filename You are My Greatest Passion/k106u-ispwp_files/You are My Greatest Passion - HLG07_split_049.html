<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_50">*Chapter 49*: Chapter 49</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Haha so about this. For some
reason I had trouble writing Ron and Hermione's wedding, I just
couldn't picture it. It's not that I don't think their perfect for
each, I just couldn't figure out how their wedding would be. So I
wrote chapter Fifty while I was trying to figure it out. Expect it
probably today or tomorrow, depending on how long it takes me to
edit. Te-he</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Forty-Nine</p><p class="calibre7">Harry walked into the burrow to find
Ron sitting at the table, alone,nursing a bottle of butterbeer.</p><p class="calibre7">"Whats wrong Ron?" Harry asked
taking a seat next to him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I asked Hermione." he said as he
took another sip.</p><p class="calibre7">"And..." Harry asked confused, he
was more than positive Hermione would say yes.</p><p class="calibre7">"She said yes." Ron said calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">"So what's the problem?" Harry
asked, really confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Her and Mum are at the Granger's
right now. I had to hide from them, I can't handle that stuff."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed. "Wedding planning, ah
something I wouldn't even wish on my enemies." he took another
drink.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know," Ron said exasperated
"Ribbon and Lace, and Harry what the hell is tulle?" Ron asked
throwing his hands in the air. "They kept talking about it. Bridal
or regular, beige or cr√®me. I don't understand it."</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay Ron, I don't think were
supposed to." Harry laughed and Ron nodded. "come on let's go get
a game in before they come back for dinner." Harry said getting up
from the table and heading for the door.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">August 3rd 2002</p><p class="calibre7">Harry held Ginny close as they made
their way towards the tent, erected for Ron and Hermione's reception.</p><p class="calibre7">"You know," Harry said as he leaned
into Ginny. "You could consider that the first muggle wedding I've
ever been to."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. "It was a bit weird
they didn't cross wands or anything." Ginny exclaimed in a whisper,
looking to make sure none of Hermione's muggle relatives had heard
the word wand. They had carefully planned the early August wedding so
that Hermione's family could comfortably attend. Mrs. Granger had
worked endlessly with Molly to make sure the wedding screamed muggle,
while still retaining a bit of the magical community. All in all the
ceremony had been a success with the exception of Aunt Muriel who
kept going on about how perfect her goblin made tiara was.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny made their way to stand
behind Laura and Lynn, the Prewett twin who had been flower girls at
their own wedding almost two years ago.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey mate." Harry said placing a
hand on Ron's shoulder as he and Hermione made their way to stand in
the back of the precession. "How's it feel?" he chuckled.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron smiled sappily "Amazing." he
answered looking at Hermione.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his head before turning to
face the tent again.</p><p class="calibre7">He chance a glance at Ginny as they
made their way to the head table. Her blue bridesmaid dress fit
seamlessly against her body and clashed with her hair perfectly. Ron
had really hit something when he suggest blue as wedding colors.
Harry laughed as the memory rolled in.</p><p class="calibre7">The four had been sitting at Harry and
Ginny's small kitchen table, the girls endlessly pouring over bridal
magazines while Harry finished some paper work and Ron fought to stay
awake.</p><p class="calibre7">He had been taken by surprise when
Hermione suddenly turned to him and asked what color scheme he
thought would be best. Ron had blurted out the first color that came
to mind, which also happened to be the color of the table cloth on
the surface beneath them. Hermione had first given him a sour look
before turning to Ginny to discuss the option of blue. In the end she
had agreed with Ron's decision, no matter how random it had been.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat at the head table patiently
waiting for the servers to bring their food.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny let out a huff. "I really wish
we could have just done that one part magically." she said
referring to the plate and how long it was taking.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know," Harry said rubbing her
back, "but think how Hermione's muggle relatives would reactif
their food just, suddenly appeared out of no where." he laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well Dudley didn't freak out at our
wedding." Ginny argued.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes well, Dudley had been aware of
the magically world for sometime now. And beside he was just happy
enough to have food in front of him." Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed again. "Yeah, I guess
so."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he held Ginny close on
the dance floor. They were supposed to be waltzing but instead were
watching Arthur go from muggle to muggle asking random questions. His
latest had been 'what is the purpose of the enter-net?' he had then
proceeded to ask if there was an exit-net also. Ginny at first hadn't
understood it but after an explanation from Harry, she had laughed
right along with him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your father sometimes." Harry
laughed as he twirled her once again. Ginny beamed up at him happily
before Molly exclaimed from across the room. "Cake!" Ginny had
bolted across the room. "I want the first piece after Ron and
Hermione" she cried as she dragged Harry through the crowd.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">They once again found themselves at the
head table, Ginny holding her stomach tightly. "I think I ate too
much." she moaned.</p><p class="calibre7">"That would be an understatement
Harry laughed as he took another small bite of his cake, Ginny on the
other hand had nearly inhaled hers.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione leaned forward from down the
table. "Is she okay?" she asked, concern marring her voice.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded, before pointing at Ron
who also was experiencing tummy troubles. "She's suffering from
Weasley syndrome." he laughed and Hermione nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, we just have the bouquet toss
left before me and Ron head out." Harry nodded. "So you could
leave after that, you just have to make sure you get our presents.
Maid of honor and Best Man duties!" she beamed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do I have to organize them
alphabetically like you did ours?" he asked jokingly.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione shook her head. "No, just
drop them off, neatly, in out flat." she laughed before turning
back to her plate.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry waited patiently as the last of
the muggle relatives gathered their things to leave. He had already
sent Ginny home to sleep and was now waiting to send the presents to
Ron and Hermione's flat. He watched as the last aunt got into her car
and began to drive away before Banishing the gifts to the flat. He
did a double check to make sure he hadn't missed any. When he was
sure he had them all he said a quick goodbye to Molly and headed to
the apparation point.</p><p class="calibre7">With a small pop he blinked out of
existence and into his flat.</p>
