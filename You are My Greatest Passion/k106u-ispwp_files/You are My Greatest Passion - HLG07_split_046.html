<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_47">*Chapter 46*: Chapter 46</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Wow what a weekend! My guard so got third place at their compitition! yeah! but then my daughter dropped my phone off the stairs and it broke. just spent $400 on a new one....greeeaat. Okay read and review!</p><p class="calibre7">Also im working on editing things because i'll be doing a major load with in the next week or two. My hubby is coming home on leave for two weeks, so during that time there will be no updtes. sorry. but ive got like 4 chapters to upload before then so...yeah. i think i worded this a bit confusing. sorry. lol.</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Forty Six</p><p class="calibre7">"I hate weddings." Harry said as he pulled his dress robes from the back of the closet.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah but look on the bight side." Ginny said from next to the bed, where she was furiously shoving things into an overnight bag. "its Georges, so it should be a good time." she laughed. "I'm sure Mum will have at least one melt down before the whole thing is said and done."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I guess." he mumbled as he haphazardly shoved the robes into the bag.</p><p class="calibre7">He took one last look around the room, checking for anything he'd left behind.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly had insisted they all stay at the Burrow in the days leading up to Georges wedding-at the Burrow. Personally he though it was a little, well crazy. But he wasn't one to question Molly Weasley in wedding mode.</p><p class="calibre7">His eyes stopped on Ginny's night stand and he let his mind drift back to the last time they had stayed at the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey Gin." he said not taking his eyes off the drawer. "your going to bring your stuff with us, aren't you?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Um yes. What do you think I've been packing all day?" she asked, giving Harry a questioningly look.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not that stuff." he waved his hand at her bag. "You know, your stuff, that you keep in the drawer." he pointed at the bedside table.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, thats stuff." she said walking over to her side of the bed. "So what you really want to know is if your going to get any in the next three day. Am I correct?" she asked holding up the box that held the bottles of potion.</p><p class="calibre7">"Um, well..." Harry ran his hand threw his hair, he suddenly felt like a child nervously asking for another cookie. "Yes?" he smiled uncomfortably.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed as she tried to push the box into her already full bag.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hmm, it wont fit."</p><p class="calibre7">"Here,here." Harry said taking it from her. "It can fit in my bag."he quickly slipped it into his bag a smiled brightly at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">"Mmm hmm, love you too." she gave him a small kiss as she grabbed her bag and headed for the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry crashed onto Ginny's small childhood bed. A full Weasley dinner would wear you thin. He sighed as he rubbed his eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"I feel the same." Ginny groaned as she closed the bedroom door. "It's been a long day."</p><p class="calibre7">she shook out her hair, before slipping out of her robe and reaching for a hair brush.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uhh," Harry groaned. "Come here." he reached for her from the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" she asked running the brush threw her hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come here." he emphasized reaching for her, but still not getting up off his back.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny huffed and went to sit next him on the bed. "What?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you know how hot you look?" he asked as he ran his finger up the strap of the night dress.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really?" Ginny asked skeptically. "This, turns you on. Of all things." she laughed looking down at the dowdy white night dress.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey don't laugh. It makes you look, I don't know. Innocent." he chuckled himself. "Okay I guess it is kind of weird." he paused momentarily and looked her in the eyes. "Nonetheless." he pulled her down to him and kissed her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moaned softly into it and Harry took the opportunity to slip his tongue into her mouth.</p><p class="calibre7">He plunged deep into her mouth, relenting only when she pushed him back for air.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry" she moaned as he moved to her neck. "Are you sure," she panted, "We should do this, here." she let her head drop back again as he snaked his hand down and into her knickers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," she let out as he rubbed softly. She pushed him away as she got off the bed, and Harry gave a small whimper.</p><p class="calibre7">She held out a waiting finger to him before rummaging through her bag. Harry laughed as she furiously threw thing out of the small duffel.</p><p class="calibre7">He reached down and pulled a vial out of the small box that rested on top of his stuff.</p><p class="calibre7">"Looking for this?" he taunted, holding up the small vial.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and smiled as she walked over to him.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you going to do for it?" he asked as she stood in front of him. he trailed his hand up her thighs and pushed the nightdress a bit higher.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smirked and pulled the dress above her head, before wrapping her arms around Harry's neck.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moaned as he kissed the area just below her navel. He sucked on the soft skin slightly before trailing his tongue over to her hip bone.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," she moaned as he dipped his tongue slightly beneath the elastic of her knickers.</p><p class="calibre7">She pushed him back slightly, before reaching to lift off his shirt. He threw it to the side of the room before Ginny pushed him back onto the bed and undid his jeans.</p><p class="calibre7">She tugged them down as she stood between his legs. She tossed them aside and ran her hands up his legs and underneath his boxers. She clutched the fabric from the inside before pulling them down slowly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry watched as Ginny hovered over him, she breathed softly and the warm air made him shudder. He grabbed her shoulders roughly and pulled her up to kiss him. He then haphazardly yanked her knickers down and kissed up her body.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hmmm, I love you." he said softly as he met her face.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too." Ginny said as she grasped his shoulders. "Ohh,"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry pushed himself deep into her, "Oh, Gin. I love this," he said as he pulled back and pushed into her again.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny wrapped her legs tightly around his back as he thrust in and out of her.</p><p class="calibre7">"harry, faster. Please." she gasped as he dipped his head to nuzzle her neck.</p><p class="calibre7">He pushed faster, causing Ginny to bite down hard on her lip. "Oh, Harry, Oh." she dug her nails into him, "I'm, I'm...Oh." she squeezed him to her before he moved her leg to rest on his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," he moaned as he leaned down to kiss her sloppily.</p><p class="calibre7">He thrust erratically into her for a moment, before slowing his motions and finally coming to a rest.</p><p class="calibre7">He panted above her for a moment before lowering her leg. He lay down on her chest and tried vainly to still his breathing.</p><p class="calibre7">He rolled off of her and stretched. "Ah, that was great."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I know." Ginny smirked as she moved to cuddle up against him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he wrapped his arms around her. He planted one last kiss upon her head before dousing the light and nodding off.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry awoke the next morning to the smell of bacon and eggs drifting up the stairs. He looked down at Ginny, still sleeping on his chest, to lower down his body, where another vital part was also stirring. <em class="calibre9">Ugh, great way to start a morning.</em> He stretched slightly causing Ginny to move.</p><p class="calibre7">She rubbed at her eyes before looking up at him. "Good morning," she said sleepily.</p><p class="calibre7">"It could be." Harry smiled motioning under the covers.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked down, "Oh, well yes." she laughed as she moved closer to him, wrapping a leg over him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he flipped her over and began kissing her chest, "Mmm, morning sex..." he half sung into her chest, causing her to giggle again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, but if you planning to go through with this you need to hand me another vial." she said pushing at his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat back on his knees, and Ginny gave a small whistle. "Look at that bod." she laughed as Harry reached into his bag.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ha-ha, very funny." he said as he handed her the vial.</p><p class="calibre7">She drained it and set it on the night table next to the other empty bottle. "Now where were we?" she laughed as he moved back on top of her.</p><p class="calibre7">He kissed her neck and positioned himself, just as some one clambered down the stairs. Harry stilled and Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, a silencing charm." she moaned, arching her hips against him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, yeah." he said as he retrieved his wand from the bedside table and muttered, "Silencio"</p><p class="calibre7">he sat it back on the table and turned back to her. "Are we ready now?" he laughed and Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">He quickly pushed into her, less something else distract them.</p><p class="calibre7">They rocked together a while before Harry buried his head in her neck. "Gods, Ginny." he moaned. "I'm...oh." he let out a low moaned before collapsing on top of her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now to go back to sleep." he muttered against her neck, another hand idly massaging her breast.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, stop it." Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Stop what?" her asked moving to the other one.</p><p class="calibre7">"That," she laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why would I want to stop. You've got such wonderful..."</p><p class="calibre7">his words were cut off by the opening of the bedroom door.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin Mum says...Oh Gods." Charlie stopped short in the door way as he took in the sight.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry quickly covered Ginny's bare breast with his hands and looked at Charlie, a sick look masking his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Charlie?" Ginny asked, breaking him out of his stupor.</p><p class="calibre7">"What, Oh. Umm, Mum say breakfast is ready." he shut the door promptly and could be heard mumbling down the stairs. "Why me? Why did Mum have to send me to get them? Scared for life."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he sat up. "Well I guess we need to get down stairs."</p>
