<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_3">*Chapter 2*: Chapter 2</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">CHAPTER TWO*</p><p class="calibre7">A week later Harry found himself alone with Ginny in her room. She sat with her back against her head board and her legs stretched out in front of her. Harry was in the same position with his back against the back board. He was reading <em class="calibre9">Qudditch through the Ages </em>as He and Ginny had having a very heated discussion about who would end up in the World Cup this year.</p><p class="calibre7">"There's no way the Holyhead Harpies are going to make it to the Cup." Harry kept repeating. Every time Ginny said the same defense.</p><p class="calibre7">"They haven't lost a match yet! There is still a very good possibility that they will go all the way." She sighed and leaned on her left arm. "Besides you don't actually expect the Sweetwater All-Stars to win, do you?" she raised her eyebrows in a skeptical sort of way.</p><p class="calibre7">"They've had a good run, this could be their year!"</p><p class="calibre7">Suddenly a tall red headed boy appeared in the doorway looking rather upset. Ginny being the first to notice him asked "What's wrong with you?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron made his way across her room and sat backwards in her desk chair his arms propped against the back and his head resting on his hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hermione is mad at me." He sighed slowly.</p><p class="calibre7">"So she's always upset with you. What makes this time any different?" Harry inquired.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, ever since we started dating our fights have seemed to be more serious."</p><p class="calibre7">"What did you say to make her upset?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron sighed. "Well we were discussing Quidditch, and I was trying to explain it to her and she wasn't truely grasping the concept. So I told her not to worry about it. Girls never truly GET Quidditch."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gave Ron an appalled look. "What do you mean girls don't get Quidditch?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Ginny, I didn't mean you, I was just trying to make Hermione feel better, but...well it kinda backfired."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah well that what you deserve you git!" Ginny shot at him "I bet me and Hermione could beat you any day!"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well that's an idea." Harry piped up, "I'm tired of sitting around all day, let's go and play a round." Everyone one agreed. They quickly headed out to the broomshed. Hermione somewhat reluctantly after Ron had apologized, boarded her broom and began to hover. She had never been very comfortable flying and this time would be no exception. But after a while she began to relax and she and Ron actually gave a good fight, although Harry and Ginny still smashed them. They played late into the evening up until they heard calling from the back door that it was time to wash up for dinner.</p><p class="calibre7">The next morning the four of them sat in the family room Ron teaching Hermione how to play wizard chess, and Ginny relaxing with her back in between Harry's legs and leaning against his chest. She was emerged into a book she was reading and Harry was absent mindedly playing with her hair as he read over her shoulder. Suddenly there was a loud knock at the kitchen door. They heard answer it and then a familiar voice filled the burrow as Mrs. Wealsey led Professor McGonagall into the family room where the four of them were relaxing. Mrs. Weasley then headed back into the kitchen to start lunch.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hello Professor McGonagall." Harry said looking up from the book he and Ginny were reading.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hello Mr. Potter, Miss Granger,Mr and Miss Weasley. I am here today with news on the condition of Hogwarts and to discuss your options."</p><p class="calibre7">"Options?" Hermione questioned</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes due to the war, I have discussed with the board to give you three special opportunities to complete your educations."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really!" Hermione shrieked, Harry knew she was upset about not sitting for the NEWT's and would be excited to say she had.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now that we have re-built the majority of Hogwarts, and it is now safe enough to resume classes. Although, I am sad to say there will be no Quidditch season." Harry saw Ginny's face drop, he knew she was really looking forward to another season. "The pitch was far to destroyed to rebuild in such a short period, all the stands have been destroyed beyond magical repair. But none the less we have made great progress." She sighed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now for you three." She motioned at Harry, Ron and Hermione. "You have three options. The first is to come back to Hogwarts and resume you schooling with the rest who were absent. The second is to complete your course work by owl. And the third and you must remember this is just for you three, is that you may chose to take an altered version of the NEWT's and go off into what every training you chose, and qualify for. I have heard that all three of you express interest in working for the Ministry, but to do that you must take you NEWT's and complete other training courses." She looked at the three, wide eyed. "I don't expect an answer today, but I do need one before the end of the week so as to make any needed arrangements." Her eyes fell on Harry and she gave him what looked somewhat like a smile.</p><p class="calibre7">After Professor McGonagall had left Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny made their way up to Ron's room and started discussing what they were going to do.</p><p class="calibre7">"I really want to finish but I just don't feel right about going back" Hermione said "I really want, and need to spend some time with my parents." She looked sideways at Ron who had his head down. "I think my best bet is going to continue by owl and take the NEWT's as early as I can." she continued "That way I can get a head start on my training. What do you think Ron?" Ron looked up at her stunned.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know…" but before he could get anything else out Mrs. Weasley burst into the room her eyes alive.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh Ronald I've just heard the news! I'm so happy you will be able to go back to Hogwarts!" Ron looked at her stunned, apparently that wasn't his plan, but he knew better than to fight with his mother about something like this. "Yeah Mum that's um... That what I was planning on doing." He gave her a weak, and very fake smile but it seemed to appease her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Lunch is almost ready dears." She said as she began to walk out of the room and back downstairs to the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I guess I'm going back to Hogwarts then." Ron sighed</p><p class="calibre7">After dinner they all sat in the family room talking again.</p><p class="calibre7">"What about you Harry, are you going to go back to Hogwarts?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shrugged his shoulders. In the search for the horcruxes he was so sure he was going to die that he hadn't really thought of what he was going to do afterwards.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, I guess I'll sleep on it and let you know in the morning."</p><p class="calibre7">And with that he bid them all good night, gave Ginny a small kiss, at which Ron visibly winced, and headed downstairs to Percy's old room where he was staying.</p><p class="calibre7">He truthfully didn't have the slightest idea what he was going to do. Of course he wanted to finish school, but going back to Hogwarts would mean he would once again be the Boy-Who-Lived. He would have to deal with all the stares and people talking, and he wasn't sure if he was just yet ready for that. <em class="calibre9">But it would be nice to be there with Ginny.</em></p><p class="calibre7">With his back to the door he began to undress. He had pulled off his shirt and was just beginning to undo his trousers when he felt two very warm and very soft hands on his back. He sucked in a deep breath just as he felt soft kisses behind his ear and down his neck. Ginny had just moved her hands around to his stomach and down towards his belt when he caught them and turned himself around to face her. She gave his a small mischievous smile that would have been worthy of the twins and reached up to kiss him. But he stopped her. She gave him a very surprised and very hurt look before He asked</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny what are you doing in here, if anyone found out we both would be in serious trouble." He looked down at her and the smile returned. "I just thought you could use some…persuasion." She stifled a giggle.</p><p class="calibre7">"Persuasion for what?" Harry asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"To come back to Hogwarts!" She smiled even bigger "Since I've finally got you I don't want to let you out of my sight." She laughed. "And think of how great it would be to have you at school with me. We could be a normal couple Harry. Walk around holding hands, sitting down by the lake. Oh Harry wouldn't it be great?" She asked somewhat pleading with him. He looked down into her chocolate eyes. "Well I guess I'm going back to Hogwarts then. If it means that much to you." He was unsure if this was the wisest decision but it sure felt right. He leaned down and kissed her deeply. He ran his tongue around her lips practically begging for entry, and she obliged. He ran his tongue all over the inside of her mouth as she held on to him tightly pushing herself closer and closer to him.</p><p class="calibre7">Suddenly the bedroom door opened and in the door way stood a very serious looking Mrs. Weasley.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny" she yelled "What are you doing?" Harry suddenly realize that he was shirtless and that his belt was undone. <em class="calibre9">This looks very bad.</em> He tried to say something but he had lost the ability to talk. Instead it was Ginny who broke the silence. "Oh mum isn't it fantastic! Harry's decided to go back to Hogwarts!" She shrieked with delight.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well Harry that's wonderful." Mrs. Weasley seemed to have forgotten about the situation she had just found them in, and Harry was all but relived.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'll owl Minerva tomorrow with you answers, and then well all go to Diagon Alley to get supplies." She began to walk out the door but turned around abruptly "It seems Hermione has decided not to go back though." Her voice seemed somewhat disappointed as she walked out the door closing it.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny looked at each out strangely before Mrs. Weasley re-opened the door and looked at Ginny before shouting "Out!" Harry gave Ginny a quick kiss before she headed down the hall to her room.</p><p class="calibre7">He smiled to himself. Although he didn't know if going back to Hogwarts was the right thing to do he was sure happy that he'd get to spend the time with Ginny. He finished undressing and got into bed. He fell asleep almost immediately to dreams of walking around the lake with Ginny by his side.</p>
