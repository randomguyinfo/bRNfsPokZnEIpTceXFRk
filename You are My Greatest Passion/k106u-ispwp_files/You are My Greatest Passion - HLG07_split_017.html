<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_18">*Chapter 17*: Chapter 17</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Okay i apoligize if these chapters are a bit choppy, they are really more of fillers before i get back to the major storyline. They do have importance, but were rather difficult to drag out and write. lol. Okay, Review. have fun, Happy Holidays.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Disclaimer: smacking your sister for beating you at wii tennis=BAD. Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD. </strong>Chapter Seventeen</p><p class="calibre7">"Ronald, we are not going over this again. Now go clear the walk way like I asked you to."</p><p class="calibre7">"But I don't see why we can't just move apparition point to the back door! Then there would be no need to shovel the walk."</p><p class="calibre7">"Because Ronald!"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, because it would make too much sense." Ron said under his breath causing Harry to laugh.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry dear, have you got all your dirty clothes in the laundry room?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes Mrs. Weasley."</p><p class="calibre7">"Good. Ginny you can start on that. Come on now everyone will be here soon." And with that, Mrs. Weasley sent them all off to their task.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sat in the laundry room surrounded by the freshly washed piles of clothes. She sorted through and separated Ron and her own clothes and was currently working on Harry's pile. She picked up the green t-shirt she had seen him wear to bed a few evenings ago, without even thinking she held the shirt up to her nose and breathed in. Beneath the heavy scent of the wash soap, she could still make out the remaining scent of Harry. She quickly folded the shirt and put it in her pile, under her shirts she had already folded.</p><p class="calibre7">Out in the back yard Ron stood with his chin on his shovel, complaining about the work.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really don't see why they don't move it. It would make so much more sense."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron could you stop yapping for a minute and start helping." Harry asked fed up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sure mate." Ron said lifting his first pile of snow out of the walkway.</p><p class="calibre7">Around noon, the family began to arrive. George showed up surprisingly with Angelina. Ginny whispered in Harry's ear that she had heard from her mother that they had been 'hanging' out a lot since Fred had passed, helping each other cope. Percy and Audrey were the next to arrive followed immediately by Bill and Fleur. Charlie had sent apologizes that he would not be able to get away this Christmas.</p><p class="calibre7">Soon Andromeda stepped out of the floo holding a wiggling Teddy.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here can you take him for minute?" Andromeda asked while passing teddy to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny just smiled at him. "Hey there Teddy bear, how are you today?" she asked while tickling his tummy, causing him to giggle. "Do you want to go play?" she asked while walking him into the family room.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just stared at them, Ginny was so good with kids, and his mind began firing off images of little red headed children. He was so distracted by these that he did even notice when Andromeda asked him how he had been. She tapped him on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">"Huh." He said a bit dazed.</p><p class="calibre7">Andromeda laughed. "I asked how you've been."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I've been great." Harry replied his eyes still on the door Ginny had just walked through.</p><p class="calibre7">"I can tell." Andromeda said serenely picking up a cup of tea and heading after Ginny into the family room.</p><p class="calibre7">They all sat around the room talking.</p><p class="calibre7">"Who are we waiting for?" Audrey asked a bit confused. She looked around and counted again. "Isn't everyone here?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Hermione." Ron answered offended. "She had to finish with her parents first." Audrey nodded her head and went back to her conversation, a bit embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre7">A few minutes later a knock at the door told the final member had arrived.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay Teddy this is your last one." Harry said handing the small boy another package. Ginny helped him by ripping part of the paper for him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wow. More blocks Teddy, now we can build a really big castle." Ginny said emphasizing her words.</p><p class="calibre7">They were distracted from Teddy by a high-pitched girlish scream. "Oh my god!" they looked over to see Ron jumping up and down on the couch with their envelope in his hand.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just smiled at Ginny as Mrs. Weasley scolded Ron for acting so childish.</p><p class="calibre7">"But Mum its season tickets! To the Cannons!" he yelled excitedly. "Can you believe it? Harry, Ginny you have no idea how much I love you right now."</p><p class="calibre7">"I think we have an idea." Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Then next morning was spent picking up stray wrapping and taking down decorations.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mrs. Weasley." Harry said from his perch on the ladder. "Do you think I could borrow Errol?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Why of course dear, I'll go fetch him for you."</p><p class="calibre7">When she returned with the large barn owl, they had just finished banishing the last of the decorations to the attic.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks Mrs. Weasley." Harry said as she handed the owl and some parchment to him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Anytime dear."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry quickly wrote out a short note to Dudley suggesting a time and place, he also included instructions on how to reply." He attached the note to Errol and gave the owl the address before he took off into the sky.</p><p class="calibre7">Two days before they were to head back to school Harry and Ginny took the floo to the leaky cauldron. Harry had given Dudley directions and asked him to meet them outside. They made their way through the busy tavern and onto the street. Harry quickly surveyed the people outside until he spotted Dudley standing across the street. He was standing next to a shorter Brunette who had her back to Harry and Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry grabbed Ginny's hand and they began to make their way across to them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Dudley." Harry greeted when they were within earshot. They two boys pulled each other into a small embrace before Dudley greeted Ginny as well. The brown-haired woman he was with still had not turned around.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, Ginny. I would like you to meet, my girlfriend. Susan." The girl turned and Harry and Ginny stood shocked while Dudley gave a knowing smile.</p><p class="calibre7">Whatever Harry had been expecting it was not this. He was not expecting to be introduced to Susan Bones as Dudley's girlfriend.</p><p class="calibre7">While they sat through dinner, Dudley and Susan together told the story of how they had met. Susan had apparently offered to go with Hestia after Voldemort was killed and bring the Dursley's out of hiding. She and Dudley had began talking and hit it off immediately, when Dudley had asked Susan if she would like to go out sometime, his mother had a fit and his father had all but disowned him for wanting to fraternize with such 'freaks'. The next week Dudley had moved out from his parent's home and he and Susan had been seeing each other since.</p><p class="calibre7">"So why didn't you come back to Hogwarts this year? You're half-blood, they extended an invitation right?" Ginny asked over dessert.</p><p class="calibre7">"It just didn't feel right coming back. I really cannot explain it. I was surprised when I heard you were going back Harry, but now I see why." She gave a small chuckle as she looked at the couple.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah I was a bit worried going back myself; didn't really know what to expect but I'm happy I did." He squeezed Ginny's shoulder and gave her a small kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Dudley I'm sure you'll have no problems contacting me then." Harry laughed. "Maybe Susan can even teach to make floo calls." At this the three wizards present laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"What so funny?" Dudley asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well you know how sometimes I travel to you by the fireplace." Dudley nodded. "Well you can use the same connection to call other fireplaces. You just simply throw in the powder, and stick you head into the flames."</p><p class="calibre7">Dudley made a terrified face "aren't you ever afraid you'll get burned?" he asked seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, you wait until the flames turn a specific color." Susan laughed as she patted his hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh okay well, I don't know, I still don't like the sound of it."</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay, you seemed to do find with the owl I sent you." Harry offered.</p><p class="calibre7">"That's because I answered it." Susan provided.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, well as long as you have Susan you'll be good dud." Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Somewhere across town a clock struck the hour causing Ginny to jump and Harry to look at it watch.</p><p class="calibre7">"Crap. Gin I promised to have you home by ten-thirty. We better get going." They paid their tabs and said good-bye, making promises to see each other again soon.</p>
