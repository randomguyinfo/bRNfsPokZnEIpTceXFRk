<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_41">*Chapter 40*: Chapter 40</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: So I planned to update
yesterday, I really did. But then I woke up and was like, I want to
go to Disneyworld today. So I did. It <em class="calibre9">was</em> my mom's fortieth
birthday (which is just odd, considering that this chapter forty.
Haha) But so when I got back it was so late, I could not even think
of editing. I hope you enjoy the chapter and Disney world rocked like
always, if you've never been I've got pic's on my myspace (link
from author page) so you can go and be jealous. Ha-ha. Just joking.
Read and Review!</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Forty</p><p class="calibre7">When they arrived back at the Burrow
Molly took Teddy in for bed while Harry and Ginny sat in the car a
little while longer.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry held Ginny's hand, gently
caressing it with his thumb.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you going back to the flat?"
Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"In a bit, Ron said something
about me, him and Neville going out for a drink first." He gave a
chuckle as he ran a hand through his hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"Have fun," Ginny said a bit
sourly. "Hermione will probably insist we go to bed early." She
grimaced and Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sorry Gin." He said
leaning over to kiss her cheek. She turned her head into it and
instead kissed his lips softly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry slowly pulled her deeper into
the kiss, causing her to lift slightly from her seat.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny giggled when Harry pulled her
over to him. She quickly straddled his lap and looked down at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you Harry." She said
softly through a smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too Ginny," he
replied wrapping a hand around the back of her neck to pull her back
down to him.</p><p class="calibre7">He ran his tongue against her lip
and she obliged. They sat there for a few moments, locked in a fierce
embrace until Harry pushed against Ginny, in hopes of going further.</p><p class="calibre7">Instead, it just caused her push
against the horn, making it to blare across the silent yard.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny began to laugh uncontrollably
as Harry blushed. "I guess that's a sign that it's time to say
goodnight." He said softly, rubbing his thumbs against her hands
once again.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded softly before giving
him one last kiss. "Walk me to the door?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled. "Of course. I've
got to get Ron and Neville anyway."</p><p class="calibre7">They made their way to the back
porch and Ginny shouted for her brother and Neville. They soon showed
up and Ron began badgering Harry on what had been taking him so long.
Harry just smiled and mumbled an answer behind his blush.</p><p class="calibre7">As the two other began pulling at
Harry's arms, he reached up and gave Ginny one last kiss. "I'll
see you tomorrow." He whispered softly in her ear before he was
hauled off towards car.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny lay in her bed, silently
starring at the ceiling. It was too early to sleep, yet like she had
predicted Hermione had insisted on go to bed early. She rolled over
to her side; she could hear Luna's muffled snores coming from the
other side of the room. Apparently, she had no trouble falling
asleep.</p><p class="calibre7">But a million things kept running
through Ginny's mind and she could seem to get her brain to shut
off.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">What are you supposed to think
the night before you get married?</em> She kept asking herself.</p><p class="calibre7">She wondered idly if things would
change much, sure, they had been living together for over a year, but
was it going to be different now? Were there some unsaid rules about
to be put into place?</p><p class="calibre7">She thought about her mother's
role through her life. Cook, clean and care for the Children. Was
that what a good wife was supposed to do? How could she know?</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Maybe Mum has some sleeping
potion</em>. She wondered idly. But the prospect of getting up and
going downstairs seemed to daunting at the time. With a huff, she
rolled over to face the wall and forced herself into some form of
fitful sleep.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat at a table at the Royal
Oak, a pub Ron had recently discovered near his parents home. He
discreetly checked his watch again, it was getting later and Ron
showed no signs of wanting to leave soon. Harry dreaded the thought
of having a hangover on his wedding day but the way Ron, and
occasionally Neville kept filling his glass, a pounding headache was
the least he could expect. He appraised the glass in front of him.</p><p class="calibre7">He took a small sip as Ron returned
to the table. "Guess who just showed up?" Ron asked, wide eyed
and smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry did not have time to guess
before Seamus walked up behind Ron, with Justin Finch-Fletchley and
Dean Thomas. " 'Aving a stag party are you Harry?" he asked
excitedly.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, not really." Harry said
hoping to deter Seamus away. <em class="calibre9">The sooner I get out of here the
better. </em></p><p class="calibre7">"Ah, come on harry, just a few
drinks."</p><p class="calibre7">"Seamus I really can't do that.
I've had too much already."</p><p class="calibre7">"Actually Harry," Neville spoke
up digging into his coat pocket. "We don't have to worry, I've
brought this." He smiled big as he held up a large vial of green
liquid.</p><p class="calibre7">"What is it?" Harry asked, it
sure looked nothing like the potion he had received from Ginny
before.</p><p class="calibre7">"Opuntia ficus indica." Neville
replied proudly.</p><p class="calibre7">"In English," Ron asked
humorously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh. Well, it is a cactus. But it
will help cure the hangover right up." He said shaking the bottle.
"I've brought more than enough," he motioned towards Seamus's
group.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes!" Seamus said excitedly
punching the air. "No excuse now Harry," he motioned to the
waiter who brought over a large bottle of whisky and several other
drink.</p><p class="calibre7">Seamus proceeded to pour glass after
glass, until everyone had one. "Okay boys," he held up his glass.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey, I'm the best man,
shouldn't I give the speech." Ron interjected.</p><p class="calibre7">"Take it away Ron," Seamus
smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay boys," Ron mocked. "To
Harry's last night of freedom!" he raised the glass to the
others. They waited for a second before Harry half-heartedly lifted
his glass too.</p><p class="calibre7">"Drink up!" Ron shouted as they
all drained the small glasses.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry came through the floo of his
apartment ready to vomit. Too much alcohol and spinning. <em class="calibre9">Not good.</em>
He quickly fell onto the couch before his dinner could make a cameo.
He was asleep before Ron and Neville even made it through the
fireplace.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny woke the next morning still
tired. Hermione was up and gathering her things already.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, oh you're awake. Good we
can get started." She smiled brightly as Ginny just glared at her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny hesitantly climbed out of bed.
"That was the worst night sleep, I've ever had." She mumbled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I'm sure your Mum has
something to perk you up." Hermione said brightly. "Would you
like me to go see?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. Truth to be told if
Hermione stayed around her with the positive attitude this early, she
was liable to be hexed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny glanced over to Luna who was
neatly folding her blanket.</p><p class="calibre7">"Good morning Luna," Ginny said
calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, not really." Luna said. "I
didn't sleep to well. I don't think I've ever gone to bed that
early." She said as she placed the blanket into her bag. "But
I'll be okay once I've had something to eat."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny watched as Luna exited the
room. <em class="calibre9">Luna had had a bad night and she was still calm, why can't
I be like that in the morning, or perky like Hermione.</em> She
furrowed her brow before grabbing her robe and heading down for
breakfast.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry awoke with the sensation of
something fuzzy in his mouth. He lifted his head and attempted to wet
his lips. He sighed and reached for his glasses. He surveyed the
room. <em class="calibre9">So apparently, I did not make it to bed.</em> He looked
around but didn't see Ron or Neville. He was about to assume that
they had slept somewhere else when he heard banging around in the
kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly lifted himself from the
couch and made his way to the kitchen where Ron and Neville were
making breakfast.</p><p class="calibre7">"Morning mate," Ron said
cheerily as he slapped Harry on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry winced at the contact.
"Morning Ron." Harry said softly as he reached for a water glass.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here, take this too." Neville
said, pulling a green vial from his pocket and handing it to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">He did as told, and he could feel
the liquid calming his insides as it made its way into his stomach.
There it pooled and seemed to cool his entire body and warming it at
the same time.</p><p class="calibre7">He looked curiously at the empty
vial. His headache gone to just a small humming. "That's amazing
Neville. How'd you ever find this?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I was talking to this man
who's growing Opuntia ficus indica in the rainforest." Harry
groaned maybe he should not have asked. "And one night after
drinking he fell on the cactus and swallowed the liquid." <em class="calibre9">Okay
that is a bit interesting</em> Harry thought fighting a laugh. "And
the next morning he woke up without a hangover. Had to get stitches
because of the prickles but…"<em class="calibre9"> Harry stopped listening, Neville
knew the most random people, he was like the plant version of Luna.
</em>He thought idly as he fixed his plate.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny finished her eggs with a
smile. Luna had been right, after a little food, she did feel
surprisingly better. She grabbed another piece of toast just to be
safe.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear, if you eat much more
you won't fit into the dress." Molly joked goodheartedly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled brightly as she
unceremoniously shoved the toast into her mouth and smiled at her
Mother.</p><p class="calibre7">"When do you want to start getting
ready?" Hermione asked. <em class="calibre9">Always the one to schedule things.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, we have to be at
the church at 2 ish…" Ginny let her sentence trail.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well Ginny it's already 8! We
need to start getting ready." Hermione squealed, grabbing Ginny
from her chair and dragging her up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, what time are we leaving?"
Ron asked through a mouth full of food.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, we have to be
there a little bit after two. And it's 8 now."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh well we have plenty of time."
Ron shrugged shoving in more food. "Let's see if we can get in a
game of Qudditch."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~<br class="calibre6"/>Ginny sat stiffly in
the chair as Hermione and her mother discussed the best way to put
her hair. After twenty minutes, they decided it would look best
parted on the side and down in soft curls. Ginny sat bored, as they
pulled out their wands and set to work.</p><p class="calibre7">Luna sat on the bed, starring out
the window. "Ginny would you like me to do your nails so that you
don't have to sit there as long?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny perked up at the thought of
not sitting there as long. "Yes please."</p><p class="calibre7">"And potter wins again!" Harry
shouted as he caught the snitch again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah well, you're not going to
be so lucky next time." Ron said flying over to Neville. "How
you doing mate?" he asked. Neville, not the experience flyer had
offered to play keeper against the two in an effort to keep on his
broom.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm okay," he said carefully
checking his watch. "I think we have time for one more game before
we have to start getting ready, it's already a little past noon."</p><p class="calibre7">"Hermione your hair is so
straight" Luna commented as they loaded Ginny's dress carefully
into the car.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know, isn't it great?" She
continued to ramble on about the process of straightening it.</p><p class="calibre7">They finally made their way back up
to the house to get Ginny. "Are we ready?" Hermione asked, "We
need to leave so that Harry and the others can Floo over."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked up from the list she
had been going over and nodded. She grabbed her bag and followed her
Mother and Bridesmaids out to the car, giving one last look at the
Burrow as Hermione steered the car towards the church.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stepped out of the Weasley's
floo after Ron had motioned that it was safe. He was met by Arthur.</p><p class="calibre7">"Andromeda just left with Teddy,
George and Charlie."</p><p class="calibre7">"Who drove?" Harry asked
confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Andromeda." Arthur answered
calmly, "She was married to a muggle you know."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded and made his way to the
bathroom to change into his robes. Ron being himself had decided to
change before coming through the floo and was desperately trying to
clean the soot off his clothes.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry emerged a few minutes later,
with only his tie undone. "Okay, I'm ready" he announced.</p><p class="calibre7">The Groomsmen and Arthur piled into
the car, leaving the driver's seat empty. "Harry," Arthur asked
timidly as Harry got into the car. "You're not nervous at all?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his head. "No, am I
supposed to be?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No I guess not. I just wanted to
make sure your okay to drive." Arthur added lamely.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed it off. "Arthur
would you like to drive?" Harry asked cheerfully.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, I mean. Only if you do not
feel like it. Yes." He finally stammered out.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry quickly switched sides with
Arthur and they headed off to the church.</p>
