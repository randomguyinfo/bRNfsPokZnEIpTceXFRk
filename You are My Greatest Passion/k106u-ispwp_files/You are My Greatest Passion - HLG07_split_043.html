<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_44">*Chapter 43*: Chapter 43</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Omg, I hate the superbowl. I
went out to get some cherry coke yesterday and was in traffic for
almost an hour! Boo. Not cool, but hey it was great we watched the
halftime show and I was like, hey I performed there, yep so if any of
you watched the game I, HarryLovesGinny07 have performed at Raymond
James Stadium. Lol. So did my entire HS Band and Guard but W/E. Okay
Read and Review!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: Performing at RJ Stadium
before Bruce Springsteen,haha= Good Assuming I Own Harry Potter= BAD</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Forty Three</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stood nervously in the
bathroom of the quaint villa they had rented in France. She eyed
herself in the mirror before dusting some powder across her chest.
She looked down and surveyed the outfit Luna and Hermione had helped,
or rather forced, her to buy.<em class="calibre9"> If you can call it an outfit, more
like bows and lace strategically placed.</em> She turned to look at
herself from the side. <em class="calibre9">Well at least it makes my bum look good.</em>
She made her way over the door that lead to the bedroom but paused
with her hand on the knob. She took a deep breath. <em class="calibre9">why am I so
nervous? Its not like we haven't done this before.</em> She looked
down at her hand and cautiously turned the knob, stopping just as it
clicked. She opened the door slightly and peered into the room.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry lay in the middle of the wide
bed, arms behind his head, and quite possibly asleep. His over robes
had long since been discarded and he laid in his pants and shirt, the
tie haphazardly undone and his glasses hanging of his nose.</p><p class="calibre7">She opened the door wide and stood
with her hands on her hips. <em class="calibre9">He's asleep, he really fell asleep.</em>
She walked to stand next to the bed and shook Harry's shoulders
roughly. "wake up." She said angrily.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Harry asked, opening
his eyes just slightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What!" she said exasperated.
"you fell asleep."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well you were taking so
long." He said still not looking at her. "I just thought I'd get
a quick nap in." he yawned to rectify his point, and closed his
eyes tight once again.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny threw her arms up in the air
in frustration before climbing onto the bed. She stood above him and
began jumping with all her might. "Harry, look at me." She
yelled.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry opened his eyes with an
annoyed "What?" before taking in Ginny's attire.</p><p class="calibre7">His mouth hung open agape for a
moment before he regained the ability to speak. "You look um…well."
He raised his hands up to her thighs and pulled her forward so that
she fell onto her knees.</p><p class="calibre7">She sat, straddling his waist as he
ran his hands up the stockings she wore, and up over the lacy Garter.
"This is…" he cleared his throat. "nice." He said at his
fingered the clasp.</p><p class="calibre7">He moved his hands around to rest on
her bum, "You've got a bow on your bum." He laughed and Ginny
nodded in agreement.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know, wild isn't it." She
laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded and let his hands trail
higher, then around to her breast. He squeezed them gently through
the thin fabric.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin," he said so softly she
could barely hear him "How do I get this off."</p><p class="calibre7">Ten minutes, Harry's clothes and the
top half of Ginny's later Harry was still furiously trying to undo
the clasp on the garter belt.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," he whined. "I cant
get it."</p><p class="calibre7">"well, don't blame me. I didn't
pick it out. Besides you should have seen me trying to get it on!"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry huffed and let go of her leg.
"fine," he moved over the side table, picking up his wand. He
grabbed her leg once again, "stay still." He muttered as he began
trailing the tip down her body, ripping the thin lace and Lycra.</p><p class="calibre7">When he was finished he sat back up
and admired his work.</p><p class="calibre7">"You ripped it." Ginny said
fingering a small section of ruined lace.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know." Harry replied, smiling
as he raked his eyes over Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">He carefully knelled forward and
kissed her softly. "I love you." He whispered as he moved his
lips to her neck.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too," Ginny said as
he began kneading her breast gently. After a moment he let it softly
trail down her body and used it to lift her leg up and around his
waist.</p><p class="calibre7">She let her head fall back in a moan
as he pressed against her. He lifted her slightly from the bed as he
slid into her. "oh Gin," he said softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"yeah, I know." She responded,
pulling him closer to her. "its different, not bad thou." She
said panting already. "gods if this keeps up…" she let the
sentence trail off as her head fell back into the pillow and she bit
her lip.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, oh gods." Harry pushed
into her faster, losing the gentle rhythm they had started with.</p><p class="calibre7">He sat up, pulling her with him. She
pushed him deeper into her as he dropped his head back and moaned her
name. They sat there, pressed against each other, promising words of
love long into the night.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry woke up the next morning to a
bright light shining through the far window<em class="calibre9">. Oh its much to early
to wake. </em>He looked over to Ginny, her head resting on his
shoulder and her hair tangled down his arm. He lifted a stray piece
of lace from the bed and smiled. <em class="calibre9">Last night was one to remember.
</em>He thought as his smile grew bigger.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moved slightly next to him.
"Harry turn the light off." She mumbled, trying to bury her face
in his arm.</p><p class="calibre7">He let out a low chuckle, "Sorry,
can't turn of the sun." he moved her hair to behind her ear. "and
apparently those sheer curtains don't block too much."</p><p class="calibre7">She slowly lifted her head and
looked at Harry. "Good morning." She said smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, it is." He said pretending
to look under the covers at her. She laughed, snatching at the
blanket.</p><p class="calibre7">She gave a content sigh as she
turned over and laid her head back on his chest. Harry wrapped an arm
around her and intertwined their hands.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny carefully lifted their joined
hands and admired the way the matching rings sparkled in the morning
light.</p><p class="calibre7">"so Mrs. Potter," Harry said
smirking at her. "</p><p class="calibre7">"What would you like to do today?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny thought for a moment as she
starred out the window. "I know!" she said brightly, sitting up
and pulling the sheet with her.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded for her to continue.
"we should go to St. Raphael and see the Roman Ruins."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, that sounds very
interesting." he rolled his eyes, "Do you want to get some
breakfast first? Their supposed to have a really nice buffet." he
asked getting up from the bed and slipping into a clean pair of
boxers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, please."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smirked brightly slipping on
his shirt. "Use up a lot of energy last night?" he asked
confidently.</p><p class="calibre7">"yeah, sure. That's it." She
laughed as she fixed her hair in the mirror. "you ready?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah," he sighed. "let's go
see what they have." He pocketed his wand and they headed down the
stairs.</p>
