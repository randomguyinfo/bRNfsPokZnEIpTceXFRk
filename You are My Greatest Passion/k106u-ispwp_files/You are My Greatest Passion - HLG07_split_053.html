<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_54">*Chapter 53*: Chapter 53</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: I so happy everyone enjoyed the last chapter. I think it was the most quoted review chapter I've ever had. Lol. Okay now to answer questions from Ravenclaw85, I couldn't find your email. If your referring to the chapter where Harry finds the ring in his parent's Gringotts Vault, then yes this is most likely that story. And secondly I will be 20 on March 7th Te-he. I know, I know that seems young, especially to be married with a kid, but hey I dual enrolled and Graduated HS with my AA in Childcare, ta-da. Cause I'm cool like that.</p><p class="calibre7">Okay Enough rambling, I don't own Harry Potter. Read, Review and Enjoy.</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty Three</p><p class="calibre7">August 7th 2005</p><p class="calibre7">"James you get out of that." Ginny yelled across the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">James looked up at his Mum and smiled before going back to the cabinet he had been playing with.</p><p class="calibre7">"James, I said no."</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you need any help?" Hermione asked as she entered the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Ginny squealed running over to her, "Look at you belly." she gushed. "It' so tiny."</p><p class="calibre7">"I know," Hermione said, "Just a little over three months now." she smiled brightly before the crash of pots took their attention away.</p><p class="calibre7">James sat in front of the cabinet, almost every pan Ginny owned in front of him.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed. "James I said no," she repeated again as she walked over to the toddler and picked him up. "What's it going to take to get it into your head?" James just smiled as Hermione swished her wand to put all the pots back in place.</p><p class="calibre7">"yea!" he clapped when the cabinet door shut. He stared at it for a moment before all the pot came flying out again across the kitchen floor.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed loudly. "Just leave them out, I'll get them later." she said setting James back down again.</p><p class="calibre7">"So I guess there is no question about whether he's magical or not." Hermione laughed as she began helping Ginny levitate platters to the back yard.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded half heartily as Harry came over to them. "Were all done out here," he said motioning to the back yard. "What do you think?"</p><p class="calibre7">"The first birthday sign is crooked." she said setting down the platters.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well we meant to make it like that. Matches James personality." Ron defended.</p><p class="calibre7">"mmmhmmm," Ginny nodded vacantly as she walked back into the house. "James," she hollered. "Party time!"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, we need to talk." Ginny said seriously as she walked into Harry's upstairs office and took a seat.</p><p class="calibre7">"About what Gin?" he asked, looking up briefly before turning back to his pile of papers.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry." she began sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" he asked, still scanning the parchment.</p><p class="calibre7">"Would you put the damn paper down for a bloody minute?" she yelled, standing from her seat.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up, shocked. He carefully sat the paper down. "What's wrong Gin?"</p><p class="calibre7">She gave a great huff as she plopped back down into the chair. She placed her head in her hands and mumbled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, you know I can't hear you when you do that." Harry said getting up from his seat and walking over to stand beside her. He knelt down and took her hands, tilting her head upward in the process. "Now Gin, tell me what's wrong?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny took a deep gulp. "Harry, I think. No, thats wrong. I'm relatively positive." she shook her head, "Harry, were pregnant."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ron laughed as he patted his sister's stomach. "I hope he's just like James."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stared at him incredulously. "And what is wrong with James?" she asked, offended.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well for one, he's climbing the bookshelf." Ron said pointing.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned around to find James, sure enough halfway up the living room shelf. "James Sirius you get down here this instant."</p><p class="calibre7">"No." James said sternly, moving up another shelf.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny huffed. "James Sirius Potter, I said get down here, now!"</p><p class="calibre7">James smiled down as he sat on the top of the bookshelf.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gave a great huff before turning to Ron. "Get him down please." She plead. "My magic's been off lately."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, okay." Ron said, feigning irritation. He lifted his wand and carefully levitated James down.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stalked up to him, "Time out, now." she said sternly and James pouted as he stomped out of the room.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">January 2006</p><p class="calibre7">December rolled in quickly and a layer of snow covered the ground into early January. Hermione and Ginny sat on the back porch of the Burrow watching the numerous Weasley grandchildren play. Ginny let out a great laugh as Fred and Molly began pelting Teddy and Victorie, the chosen sitters for the day, with snowballs.</p><p class="calibre7">"So," Ginny started, keeping a weary eye on James. "any clue what your naming <em class="calibre9">it</em>?" she asked, laughing a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione chuckled, after all it had been her idea to keep the sex a surprise. "Well if it's a girl we were thinking Rose." she ended rubbing her stomach.</p><p class="calibre7">"And if it's a boy..." Ginny pried.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione took a deep breath. "Ronald Jr." she rolled her eyes dramatically and Ginny sat with her mouth agape.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really?" she asked, holding back the hoards of laughter.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione looked offended. "Oh and what brilliant name do you to have thought up this time."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shut her mouth. "I don't want to talk about it." she mumbled.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione laughed. "That bad?"</p><p class="calibre7">"It's not bad, just awkward. And well...It doesn't matter, Harry likes it." she ended with a sigh.</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione laughed again. "So what is it?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked around uncomfortably. "Albus Severus."</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione was at a loss for words, she gulped a few times before finding her voice. "And you, made fun of Ronald Jr.?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shot her a dirty look, "They were to very great Wizards of our time. And well Harry wants to honor them."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I guess I can understand that. Albus Severus." she shook her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shut it Hermione." Ginny said crossing her arms.</p><p class="calibre7">"James get off of Teddy this instant!" she yelled as she watched the small boy try to take the older down. She stood and menacingly made her way over to him. The last thing heard out of James mouth before he shot across the yard was 'oh no'.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny brought James onto the porch, him pouting all along. "Now young man you are going to sit there until you learn to behave."</p><p class="calibre7">James stomped his feet and crossed his arms as he took a seat next his aunt.</p><p class="calibre7">After a few moments in silence Hermione let out a small gasp and James looked next to himself in horror. "Mummy, Aunt Hermione wet herself."</p>
