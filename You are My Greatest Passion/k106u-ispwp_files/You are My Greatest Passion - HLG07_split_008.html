<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_9">*Chapter 8*: Chapter 8</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Same as always, don't own...blah. i wish i did though. God what i could do with that money...lol. </strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Eight</p><p class="calibre7">When they arrived at the Castle and were lead in to the great hall, Harry was glad to see Cho leave and go to her former house table, rather than sticking with him, Ginny, Neville and Ron. They found seats among their fellow Gryffindor's. They began the normal chitchat while Harry held Ginny's hand under the table, he was amazed how incredible, and yet natural it felt. There were stares from students and teachers, but he did not care. What was important was that Ginny had asked him to be here and he was.</p><p class="calibre7">Soon Hagrid began leading in a very eager looking bunch of first years. In front of the head table was a stool. Professor McGonagall walked forward and placed the sorting hat upon it. Harry was happy to it had survived the final battle, especially since Voldemort had set it on fire.</p><p class="calibre7">"This here" she began in a loud voice wail motioning to the hat " is the sorting hat, it will look deep into your thoughts and determined which house is the right one for you." she stepped aside and pulled out a scroll.</p><p class="calibre7">"Kaelen Abernath" rang loudly through the halls as a small red headed girl walked slowly up to the hat. It was barely upon her head when it sang out "Gryffindor!" and the hall broke out in cheers.</p><p class="calibre7">After the last student had been sorted Hagrid took the hat and stool aside and McGonagall continued her speech "Over the past year we have suffered many great loses, but we must pull together and push ahead, they must not be lost in vain" she looked out among the students. "Please enjoy yourself and be kind to one another, only in friendship and equality will evil truly be defeated." she then sat down and the feast appeared.</p><p class="calibre7">The feast was better than Harry could remember it ever being, he made a note to go down and see Kreacher and Winky and thank them. After the last dish had vanished, Professor McGonagall stood again and motioned for silence. "We only have two changes in staff this year, and that will be Defense against the Dark Arts and Muggle Studies" Somewhere among the crowd someone yelled, "You mean you didn't want to keep the Carrows?" and the hall burst into laughter, Harry even though he saw McGonagall smile a bit. She soon straightened herself and motioned for silence again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your new Defense against the Dark arts teacher will be Auror Williamson." she waved her hand toward a man Harry remembered from Fudges last year as Minister. He wore dark red robes and his hair back in a ponytail like Bill. After the clapping died down, she continued. "And In charge of Muggle Studies will be Mrs. Hestia Jones" Harry remember her from the night she helped him escape the Dursley's a few years prior.</p><p class="calibre7">"Also Mr. filch has asked me to remind you that the list of forbidden objects is posted on his door and that the third floor corridor is off limits. Also Professor Hagrid has asked that you do not enter the forest without a teacher or sixth year and above." She took a breath and nodded at Hagrid. "also we have the opportunity to have a few teacher assistants this year. I would like you to please welcome back Ms. Chang, Mr. Longbottom and Mr. Potter. Now if first years will follow the Prefects up stairs, classes start tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre7">When they finally reached the common room Ginny went up to her room to change and Harry plopped down in his favorite chair by the fire. It felt good to be back at Hogwarts. Even with all the stares, nothing in the world felt more right to him than Hogwarts. Just then, as if to reiterate his thought, Ginny started down the stairs in her pajama's and Harry realized it felt really good to be back at Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny slowly walked over to him. "What are you smiling at Potter?" she asked through her own smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just the prettiest girl at Hogwarts, She standing over there" he laughed as he pointed to a non-existent person. Ginny swatted at him and he grabbed her arm pulling her down to join in the roomy armchair. He wrapped his arms around her waist and let her rest her forehead upon his. She leaned down for a kiss and Harry adjusted them so she could be more on top.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't you two ever give it a rest" hollered a very annoyed Ron from the foot of the stairs. "And Ginny your lucky I don't tell mum about the little show you put on during the trip here." he gave her a disgusted look.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well what was I supposed to do?' she glared at Ron "Cho was basically throwing herself at Harry. I had to stake claim on my property"</p><p class="calibre7">"Your property" Harry asked, trying to sound offended, and failing miserably.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, I didn't mean it like that, I justâ€¦it's just that" Ginny fumbled over her words and Harry stopped her with a kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked at him shocked and he smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's ok, I like it that your jealous." she swatted at him again and they resumed kissing. Behind them, they could hear Ron making vomiting sounds as he made his way up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">The next morning Harry awoke to gunny jumping up and down on his bed yelling "wake-up" she ducked as Ron threw a pillow at her and stuck out her tongue.</p><p class="calibre7">"Get up breakfast is almost over and you have to get your schedules," she breathed out as she continued jumping.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry grabbed her knees so she fell backwards on to the bed. Ron laughed until he realized his sister was lying on his best mates' bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny get out of here, this is the boy's dorm," he said sternly. She stuck her tongue out at him again before she straightened her skirt and skipped out of the room. Harry looked disappointed as she left.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mate I don't want my sister on your bed" Ron tried to say lightly but in all truth, he was very serious. Harry looked at him and nodded before getting out of bed and getting dressed.</p><p class="calibre7">A few minutes later, they walked down the stairs to find Ginny having a very heated discussion with Romilda Vane.</p><p class="calibre7">When Harry walked up and put an arm around Ginny, Romilda just glared at them then stomped off.</p><p class="calibre7">"What was that all about?" Harry asked</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh she was just asking me details about you and, us and I wouldn't tell her anything" she forced a smile. She didn't want him to know that Romilda had really been asking her what she had done to trick harry into finally liking her, or whether or not they had gone any further than what she had seen in the common room the night before.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was not sure how to answer. Well at least the second question, the first on was just rude, she wasn't sure if she wanted people to know that they hadn't really done anything. The one time they had come close to going beyond snogging, Ron had interrupted and they hadn't made it to that point since, But then again she didn't want people to think she was sleeping with him either. The battle inside her head was causing a headache.</p><p class="calibre7">She was pulled out of her thoughts when Harry kissed her on top of the head "Are you sure your ok?' he asked sincerely. She could only nod in agreement.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you guys coming? I'm hungry" they both laughed at Ron's inability to wait for food.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in the great hall chatting and finishing the remainders of their breakfast when Professor McGonagall walked up. "Good morning" she said in her normal serious tone "I have your class schedules. They are the same as they would have been had you came back last year." she handed them out. "With the exception of yours Mr. Potter, And I went ahead and took the liberty to scheduled your free period the same a time as Mrs. Weasley's" she smiled a bit before adding sternly "don't make me regret it" and walking away.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked at Ginny and smiled. Ron just looked disgusted.</p><p class="calibre7">"So which period do WE have free?" Harry asked happily. Ron rolled his eyes while Ginny looked over the schedules.</p><p class="calibre7">"Look there all the same," she said showing the boys what she meant. "Ron you have the same off period as me and Harry"</p><p class="calibre7">"Great so I can stand around watching you snog each other senseless." Ginny blushed and Ron gathered up his stuff and left the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">"You know I really wish Hermione would have came back, then maybe he wouldn't be in such a sour mood" Harry added harshly. Ginny studied her schedule harder; she did not want to discuss her brother and his girlfriend right now.</p><p class="calibre7">"We have our free period right after lunch, that's nice isn't it?" she looked up at Harry hoping he was paying attention to her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, oh yeah really good" he took another bite of his food "what do we have first?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny glanced back down at the paper. "Oh great, History." Harry groaned in unison before they gathered their things and headed off for class.</p>
