<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_20">*Chapter 19*: Chapter 19</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Okay guys, so this is where that M rating comes into play. just thought i'd give a head's up. Enjoy the smut, you've earned it. lol. Review, tell me if you like it, ive got to know these things, lol.</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Nineteen</p><p class="calibre7">Harry took Ginny's hand as he led her into the dorm room and to his bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think we should talk first." Harry suddenly said.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at him surprised." About what."</p><p class="calibre7">"About why you don't want me to touch." He said with a measured amount of hurt in his voice.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," was all Ginny could bring herself to say, she was not expecting to have this conversation. She leaned down and buried her head in the pillow.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, what is it?" harry asked concerned rubbing his hand over her back comfortingly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nmhp"</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny I can't understand you when you speak into the pillow." He laughed a little. "Will you please sit up and talk to me."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny reluctantly sat up and looked over at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"There, that's better. Now what's wrong?"</p><p class="calibre7">"It's not that I don't want you to, it just. God I can't believe were having this conversation," she made to put her head back into the pillow, but Harry caught her before she could.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well if you want me to why won't you let me?" Harry asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny gave a sigh before continuing, "becauseI'mafraidyouwillbedisappointed." She quickly got the words out. <em class="calibre9">Maybe he couldn't understand. </em>Ginny thought hopefully, but one look at Harry squashed these hopes.</p><p class="calibre7">"How could I be disappointed?" he asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry I've never done anything like this before. I don't know what to do, and well what if you don't like the way I look, well down there?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed. He actually laughed. Ginny was going t to hit him. Right in the eye, and this time she would not take him to get it healed.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry saw the look on Ginny's face and quickly backpedaled. "No no Gin I'm not laughing at you, just I've never done anything like this either, and well there is no possible way I would be disappointed with how you look."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was unable to ignore the sincerity in Harry's eyes. She reached up a hand and tenderly ran it through his hair to come to a rest on his neck, where he, in turn placed his hand atop of hers.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked deep into Ginny's eyes and she gave the slightest nod. He leaned forward and gently planted his lips against her. He slowly lowered Ginny onto her back before running his tongue against her bottom lip.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry grabbed the rim of Ginny's jumper and slowly lifted it up and over her head.</p><p class="calibre7">He kissed her tenderly as he trailed a hand down her side to the button on her skirt. He slowly undid it and pulled down the zipper.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry." Ginny spoke suddenly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah," harry replied hesitantly. <em class="calibre9">I hope she hasn't changed her mind again.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"Do you suppose." She looked down and blushed.<em class="calibre9"> I seem to be doing that a lot tonight. </em>She thought sourly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you think you could undress as well, maybe make me a bit more comfortable? You know if I'm not the only one exposed."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry thought about this for a moment before nodding. He quickly removed his shirt and made to undo his trouser but Ginny hand stopped him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here, let me." She undid the button and with a deliberate slowness lowered the zipper. Harry moved to let them fall to the floor. He looked at Ginny. "Boxers too?" She just sat on the bed blushing. "I'll take that as a yes," he said as he let them too fall to the floor.</p><p class="calibre7">He sat back down on the bed next to Ginny. He pulled her into a close embrace and began to kiss her. He reached around her back and quickly undid the clasp of her bra.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laid back and let Harry remove it. Harry looked down at her as she lay on the bed before slowly tugging on the bottom of her skirt. He pulled it down and off her, grabbing her knee stockings on the way.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry slowly kissed his way back up Ginny's leg to her hip, just above her knickers. He looked up again at Ginny. Her eyes held a worried tone but she nodded her consent nonetheless.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry kissed her hip again before gripping the sides or her knickers and slowly pulling down. With each inch of skin revealed, he gave her a small kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">He dropped the last piece of clothing to the floor and made his way back up to lye next to Ginny. He carefully pushed his entire body against hers before whispering in her ear. "See I told you I'd like what I see." Ginny could not help it she started laughing," Well you've made that very apparent Mr. Pottâ€¦" her reply was cut off by Harry's lips moving against hers.</p><p class="calibre7">He moved so that he was fully on top of her. She could feel him pressing against her and for some reason it made her want to giggle like a schoolgirl. She wrapped her arms around Harry to help keep from laughing.</p><p class="calibre7">After several heated moments Ginny could feel harry inching his hand lower, towards his goal. She could feel her stomach starting to knot up with anticipation.</p><p class="calibre7">When he finally reached down he slowly ran a finger from the bottom to the top and Ginny sucked in a deep breath when he brushed against her most sensitive spot.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry must have notice her reaction, because he repeated the motion several more times. "Do you like that Ginny?" harry asked, his voice deep and husky. Ginny could only nod in affirmation.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly moved his hand and hesitantly slipped a single finger into her. He stay still for a moment before moving the slightest bit and bringing his other finger up to rub the tiny bundle that she had enjoyed so much before.</p><p class="calibre7">He worked for a minute reviling in the sound of Ginny's low moans and pants. He looked down at his hand and was struck by how such a seemingly simple action could bring her so much pleasure. He suddenly felt the need to do more. He moved his hand and slowly slid in a second finger, making sure to never remove pressure from the small bundle. This action made Ginny take in a shape breath and at first Harry was afraid he had hurt her, until she slowly moved herself on his fingers, up and down. He began his ministrations again, and in what seemed like no time he felt the flesh around his fingers begin to tighten and Ginny drew in a deep breath before yelling his name and reaching to bring him up to her. She began rapidly placing kisses all over his face, until finally planting a long, soft kiss on his lips.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry rolled them over so that Ginny could rest on his chest. She laid her head down and curled her body around him. He placed a guarding arm around her shoulders and held her close.</p><p class="calibre7">After Ginny had controlled her breathing she looked up at Harry. He had his eyes closed and seemed to be concentrating on something. "Harry," she said timidly. He looked down at her. "That was amazing." He smiled wide. "I mean really, really amazing."</p><p class="calibre7">He let out a deep laugh. "I told you so."</p><p class="calibre7">Somewhere on the other side of the school a bell rang and Harry chanced a glance at his watch.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on gin, we better get dressed." He gave her a small kiss on her head before moving off the bed and began sorting through their clothes. "Its lunchtime and we wouldn't want anyone to find us like this." He made a motion at himself and in turn his naked body.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at him, and saw him for real the first time that day, she took in his naked state. She had seen it before but not so, out there.</p><p class="calibre7">The sight caused a slowly blush to cover her body. <em class="calibre9">There has to be something I can take to keep myself from doing this so much.</em></p><p class="calibre7">She dressed with a determination to ask George if the Wonder Witch line held any product that helped with constant blushing.</p>
