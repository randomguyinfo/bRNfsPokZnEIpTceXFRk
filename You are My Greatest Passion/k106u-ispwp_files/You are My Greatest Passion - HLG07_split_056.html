<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_57">*Chapter 56*: Chapter 56! Going on Hiatus present</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: I know this is short but I wanted
to give you what I had before the hiatus. I pick my hubby up at the
airport in the morning. So Read, Review and enjoy like always. Leave
me lots of great comments while I'm gone! And a huge thank you to
everyone who had take the time to review already, It really does make
my day sometimes. I'll miss ya, See you late March!</p><p class="calibre7">*ALSO, Fridays my 20th
B-day, more comments? Hey!</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty-Six</p><p class="calibre7">January 2008</p><p class="calibre7">"So are you ready for your little
sister?" Harry asked as he took James and Albus into the burrow.
Ginny was due any day now and they were taking all the precautions.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I guess." James sighed. "Is
she going to smell as bad as Albus?" he asked looking up at his Dad
seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he rustled James hair.
"Most likely."</p><p class="calibre7">They pushed the living room door open
to find Molly handing Teddy a cup of cocoa. "Ah, there you are."
she smiled. "Teddy here said he'd help me keep and eye on the
boys." she smiled as James ran past to tackle Teddy.</p><p class="calibre7">"James, watch the glass." Harry
said as he swished his wand to lift the cup of cocoa out of Teddy's
hand just before James reached him.</p><p class="calibre7">Molly just smiled as she watched the
interaction. "How much longer do you think she has?" she asked
causally.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not much," Harry said, setting the
cup back down. "When I left she said she felt like she was having
small contractions." he said shaking his head. "Three kids." he
laughed. "Who would have ever thought." Molly just patted his
back comfortingly. "Well I better be going," He sighed. "James,
come here a minute."</p><p class="calibre7">The small boy slowly toddled over, a
small smirk on his face as Harry knelt to be eye level.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now James what did we talk about?"
he asked sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">James sighed dramatically. "Behave
and be good for Grandmum Weasley." he said, bored of the subject.</p><p class="calibre7">"And," Harry started "No climbing
on the furniture." Harry said seriously. "Or no flying your broom
when you come home."</p><p class="calibre7">"But Daddddd" James whined.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just be good and we won't have to
take it away." Harry said standing and straightening his clothes.
"Now give me a hug." He lifted James off the floor and hugged him
tightly. He then turned to take Albus from Molly, "Be good like
always." he smiled as he hugged the small boy and made to leave.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay Ginny, last time." Harry
comforted as they sat in the birthing room.</p><p class="calibre7">"I know," Ginny sighed, "It's
kind of sad isn't it?" she questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">"I guess, if you think about it that
way." Harry said as the doctor entered the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Mrs. Potter." He said looking
at the chart. "Are we ready to have a baby girl?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded, a bit teary. It was a bit
unsettling to know you were about to have your last child.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well," the doctor spoke from the
end of the bed, breaking Ginny from her thought. "Seems we are
almost there. I'll have the nurse bring something for the pain." he
said exiting the room.</p><p class="calibre7">"How are you?" Harry asked several
hours later. Soon Ginny would begin pushing and they would have the
last and final Potter.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded absently. "It doesn't
really hurt. I'm just a bit uncomfortable." She said shifting in
the bed a bit. "Can I start pushing yet?" she sighed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just wait a bit for the doctor okay?
I don't think I could deliver a baby," Harry laughed. "Through,
this will be my third time seeing it done. You'd think id know how it
goes by now." He laughed again as he rubbed Ginny's belly softly.</p><p class="calibre7">The doctor came in, snapping his gloves
loudly and breaking the soft moment. "Okay, I think were ready to
have a baby."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Why does this always take soooo
long." James whined.</p><p class="calibre7">"James stop complaining, You took
twice as long." Teddy countered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well thats because I was worth
they wait." James smirked as Teddy rolled his eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in silence a few minutes.
James sniffed the air. "Ewww, Grandmum." He tugged at Molly's
sleeve.<br class="calibre6"/>I think Albus needs a new nappie." He said wrinkling
his nose. Molly looked up from her cross stitching, and over to
Albus.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on," she smiled brightly.
"Let's get to the loo." she grabbed the young boys hand and led
him out of the waiting room.</p><p class="calibre7">As soon as she was out of sight James
turned to teddy. "Lets do something fun."</p><p class="calibre7">"No James."</p><p class="calibre7">"But why?" James whined.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because your idea of fun usually get
us, or me, in trouble." Teddy reasoned before going back to his
book.</p><p class="calibre7">James crossed his arms and he turned
back in his seat. He sighed deeply. "James, I'm not changing my
mind." Teddy said, still not looking up from the book.</p><p class="calibre7">James stomped his foot. "Well fine
then, I'll have fun without you then." He said as he stood from the
chair and started out of the room.</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy jumped up, if he let James go off
by himself, he'd still be in trouble. "James, Wait!" He yelled as
he followed the other boy out of the room.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"And you have a beautiful baby girl!"
the doctor exclaimed as Harry carefully cut the cord.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Ginny sighed as they placed
her on her abdomen. "Hello Lily." she said softly. "Oh Harry,
look red hair just like your Mum. She's a perfect Lil'." Ginny
smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry moved to lean over Ginny's
shoulder. "Or she had red hair like <em class="calibre9">her</em> Mum," Harry
laughed as he ran a finger over the delicate locks. "It's much
brighter than James." He sighed. "She's beautiful."</p><p class="calibre7">"I know" Ginny sighed. "Do you
want to call the boys in?" Ginny asked looking up at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"In a minute. Lets have a little
peace."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"James, get out off that." Teddy
said, trying to persuade the young boy out of the supplies closet.</p><p class="calibre7">"Look," James exclaimed. "AHHH,
I'M A MUMMY!" He said as he emerged, wrapped in toilet paper,
"Teddy, I'm going to eat you!" he said as he walked toward the
older boy, his arms extended straight.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, okay whatever, lets go."
Teddy said as he carefully steered James back into the waiting room.
Out side of the door stood a frantic looking Mrs. Weasley. "James,
Teddy!" she exclaimed when she saw them. "I've been looking
everywhere for you!"</p><p class="calibre7">"James wanted to have fun and ran
off." Teddy tattled. "I tried to stop him."</p><p class="calibre7">Molly knelt down in front of James.
"James, is that true?' she asked sternly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm not James, I'm a mummy."</p>
