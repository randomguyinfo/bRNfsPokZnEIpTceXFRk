			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N" Hey you guys, hope you enjoyed chapter seventeen, this one is soooo better. lol. okay but word of warning, if the formating seems to be funky, its because i typed it up on my ipod and just uploaded it straight here. lol. i think i fixed most of it but well bere with me okay? also if you didnt read the notice on my profile, my broken finger did heal but of course i was outside spinning same "said" saber that broke "said" finger and i tossed the most beautiful six i have ever seen (i throw saber in air it spins six time then i catch it) so of course i tried to do it again and caught it all weird and now there is a huge bruise on my wrist, making it very uncomfortable to type, lol. so be nice review me! AND A HUGE THANK YOU TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN REVIEWING, UBER BIG SHOUTS TO </strong>LPRenegade ,<strong class="calibre4">YOU WERE THE FIRST TO REVIEW AND WHEN I JUST CHECKED YOU WERE ONE OF THE LAST. Thank you! and now i give you...</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Eighteen</p><p class="calibre7">"You ready to head back?' Ginny asked from the doorway of Harry's room.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just packed the last of it" harry replied without looking up. "You can't tell you're packed already." He asked finally lifting his eyes to the doorway. "Hey, is that mine?" he asked incredulously pointing at Ginny's upper body.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny's eyes went wide as she looked down at herself. In a moment of relapse, she had grabbed the shirt of Harry's she had stolen, to wear to bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh, maybe." She said with what she hoped was an innocent tone of voice.</p><p class="calibre7">"I was looking for that you know." Harry said turning him body to face her completely.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh really." She replied, catching onto his game. "Do you want it back?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry gulped. She was walking towards him, and asking if he wanted the shirt, she was wearing. How did one answer that question?<em class="calibre9"> If I tell her no she will keep it on, but if I tell her yes will she get upset? </em>Harry decided to try a safer route; he grabbed her by the waist and pulled her down to his lap. He brushed a few stray hairs from her face before gently kissing her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned her body to straddle Harry, who proceeded to bring his hand around to cup her bum. They sat there like that for a few minutes, kissing passionately before they heard the clearing of a throat behind them.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned around in Harry's embrace to see Ron standing uncomfortably at the doorway, adverting his eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Uh mum says that its lights-out. Have to get up early tomorrow and everything." He managed to get his sentence out without ever looking at the two.</p><p class="calibre7">"Im, I'm just going to head up to bed now. Night." He left without waiting for a response.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned back around to Harry. "I guess I should be getting to bed to then." She slowly dipped her head and gave him a small, gentle kiss before climb out of his lap and heading down the hall for bed.</p><p class="calibre7">The train ride back to Hogwarts was rather uneventful. Harry had been worried that Cho would decide to grace them with her presence again, but she fortunately never showed. Neville said he heard it rumored that she had decided to not return for the second half of the year.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron walked through the Great Hall <em class="calibre9">where are they?</em> Harry had said that he and Ginny would met up with Ron after they had put their trunks away, but had yet to show up.<em class="calibre9"> I swear it they got caught up snogging somewhere. </em>Ron got up from his seat and began heading out of the Great Hall, determined to find Harry and Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">He soon made his way up to the Gryffindor common room. He looked around at the few people sitting around but none of them were the ones he was looking for. He chanced a glance at the stairwells. <em class="calibre9">Well I can't really check in Ginny's room, maybe Harry's still unpacking. </em>He made his way up the stairs to his dorm; it seemed no one was inside. He was about to shut the door when he heard a soft giggle. <em class="calibre9">Oh great not this again.</em> He looked over at Harry's bed where the curtains were drawn tight. <em class="calibre9">Great, just great. Can't they keep their hand to each other for a few minutes! </em>He stomped over to Harry's bed</p><p class="calibre7">"Can you guys stop snogging for just a few minutes?" he yelled.</p><p class="calibre7">He dropped himself back onto his bed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny quickly opened the bed curtain, and offered a surprised Ron a sandwich. Ron was bewildered. Instead of finding his best mate and sister in a compromising position, there they sat cross-legged with a plate of sandwiches surrounded by pictures from the last seven years and the photo album Hagrid had given Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you doing?" Ron asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"we were unpacking Harry's trunk and found all these pictures, so we decided to just bring dinner up here so we could look at them all." Ginny explained.</p><p class="calibre7">"We looked for you mate, but the Great Hall's so crowded." Harry quickly put in.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah well, I had just made my way in before I came to find you. I was up in the owlery, sending a note to Hermione." He blushed, not just from not being able to stay out of touch with Hermione for a mere 6 hours but from also jumping to conclusions that were wrong.</p><p class="calibre7">"Sandwich Ron?' Ginny offered trying to bring the attention off her brother.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah sure." He took the offered food. "Nudge over Harry."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"This isn't working. I need Hermione." An exasperated Ron declared. Several months had passed and now it seemed as if NEWT were right upon them. "I wonder if she'd help me over the floo." He continued aloud.</p><p class="calibre7">"There's only one way to find out." Ginny offered. She felt bad for her brother and Harry, neither had ever had to study on his own and seemed a bit lost without the third part of their trio. Fortunately Harry seemed to fair just a bit better.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm going to try it, worst she can say is no right?" Ron asked hopeful. He gathered his books and left the library without another word.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny sat in silence for a few more minutes.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">The Draught of peace is as followsâ€¦ wait I have read that already.</em> Harry sighed as he rubbed the bridge of his nose beneath his glasses. He looked up at Ginny who also seemed to be having problems concentrating.</p><p class="calibre7">He leaned over to her ear. "Do you want to take a break?" he whispered huskily.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at him and he raised his eyebrows suggestively before nodding toward a dark, deserted corner of the library. Ginny nodded and began packing up her books.</p><p class="calibre7">A few moments later, they found a desk in back. They dropped their bags and Ginny sat upon it, Harry moved to stand in-between her legs and she proceeded to wrap them around his waist. Ginny moved her arms around his neck and began to roughly kiss him. He went tangle his hand in her hair but was stopped by her hair clip. He swiftly removed the decoration and threw it somewhere to never be found. He ran his hand through her red locks and rested the other on the small of her back.<br class="calibre6"/>"Gods Ginny I want you so much." He breathed heavily into her open mouth. She moaned in reply.<br class="calibre6"/>He moved the hand in her hair down to rest on her upper thigh. Just inside the fabric of her skirt.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," he moaned as he slowly moved his hand up her leg. He stopped when he reached the lace of her knickers. He slowly began to move them aside. He was about to touch Ginny. His heart began to race and his palms got all sweaty. She had never let him do anything like this before.</p><p class="calibre7">Unfortunately this time was no different. Ginny reached her hand down and caught Harry's before it had<br class="calibre6"/>Gone anywhere.<br class="calibre6"/>"Harry. Not now." she said breathlessly.<br class="calibre6"/>"Then when Ginny?" Harry asked a little upset; this was not the first time this had happened. This week.<br class="calibre6"/>"I don't know." Ginny replied looking at the ground, a slow blush began to show on her skin. She would never admit it but she was afraid of having Harry touch or see her there. Not that she was afraid he'd hurt her, but that it wouldn't be what he was expecting and that he'd be disappointed. She did not think she could handle that.<br class="calibre6"/>She slowly picked herself off the desk, grabbed her bag, and began heading for the door.<br class="calibre6"/>"Ginny where are you going?"<br class="calibre6"/>"My room." She replied trying to hold back the tears, and at the same time her insecurities. She hurriedly made her way out of the library.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny come on. Don't do this?" Harry called from behind her in the hall.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Thank gods most people are in the common rooms</em> she thought as she hurried through the hall and back to her dorm.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry watched as Ginny made her way around the corner to the passageway that he knew would lead her back to Gryffindor tower. <em class="calibre9">Why won't she just listen</em> Harry thought as he threw his potions book at the cold stonewall.</p><p class="calibre7">"Eww what's potty done now." Peeves asked from up above.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing, stay out of it." Harry replied angrily.</p><p class="calibre7">"Touchy aren't we."</p><p class="calibre7">Peeves had just began taunting harry, when another book was thrown from Harry bag. directly at the poltergeist.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry slammed his fist against the cold stonewall before turning to slump against it and sit with his head in his hand. Left to ponder how this had gone from excellent to awful so quickly.</p><p class="calibre7">The next morning Harry stood at the bottom of the stairs leading to the Gryffindor girls dorms. Ginny had yet to come down and be was getting a bit impatient. He heard a door open and looked up in hopes that it was Ginny finally making her way down. However, it was only Romilda. She made her way down the stairs and smiled at Harry.<br class="calibre6"/>"Hey Harry what are doing?" She asked, smiling sweetly at him<br class="calibre6"/>"Just waiting for Ginny to come down so we can go to breakfast. You haven't seen her this morning have you?" he asked optimistically. He needed to apologize for his behavior the night before, and hoped she would forgive him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yes I don't think she's coming down. She did not look so well. Probably just stay in bed all day." Romilda said in the most innocent and sincere voice she could muster.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really? Is she okay?" Harry asked a bit worried<br class="calibre6"/>"Oh yes. She's fine," Romilda assured "But if you like I could walk down with you. I was just heading that way myself." She once again smiled at him.<br class="calibre6"/>"Yeah, I guess. You're sure Ginny not coming down?"<br class="calibre6"/>"Positive." Romilda replied quickly.<br class="calibre6"/>Harry nodded and turned to head towards the door, Romilda right behind him.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny awoke late. She chanced a quick glance at her watch. <em class="calibre9">Oh, Harry has probably been waiting forever.</em> She quickly dressed and went to head out of her dorm. When she made it to the landing she looked around Harry was not waiting at the bottom of the stairs as he usually did<em class="calibre9">. No he wouldn't hold last night against me.</em> She did a quick survey of the common room before she spotted him. Holding the door open for Romilda as they headed out into the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">When Harry arrived in the Great Hall, he said a quick good bye to Romilda before taking a seat across from Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where's Ginny?" Ron asked confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"Romilda said she was sick this morning." Harry replied while picking up a piece of toast.</p><p class="calibre7">"Romilda, eh?" Ron still did not trust her after they was she had treated Ginny earlier in the year.</p><p class="calibre7">They both shot a glance in the said girls' direction who was currently giggling with her friends while shooting glances at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just looked on disgusted.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ouch, what the hell?" Harry asked picking up the scone that had hit him in the side of the head. He looked up to see Ginny storming out of the great hall.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny wait!" he yelled as he ran through the hallway after her.</p><p class="calibre7">"No Harry." She called back calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">"But we need to talk."</p><p class="calibre7">"There is nothing to talk about harry. Apparently Romilda had got what she's been after." Ginny said sourly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you talking about?" Harry asked confused. By this time, he had caught up with her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I saw you walking her out of the common room and then staring at her down at breakfast."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, she said you were sick, said you weren't coming down. That is the only reason I walked with her. And for the staring, well the girl creeps me out Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny had stopped walking to listen to Harry's explanation.</p><p class="calibre7">"I just thought maybe you were fed up with me." She looked at her feet. "Thought maybe you had moved on." She whispered.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, I could never move on from you. You're the only one for me." Harry said softly while wrapping his arms around her, "when are you going to see that."</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know Harry. Just you were upset with me last night, then this morning. It's all a little hard to take at times."</p><p class="calibre7">"I wasn't upset with you last night it was more of a, frustrated. And this morning was just a misunderstanding. Let me make it up to you." He pleaded.</p><p class="calibre7">"How?" Ginny asked interested.</p><p class="calibre7">"Let's skip out on classes today. We can hangout in my dorm."</p><p class="calibre7">"But Harry there's only a week until NEWT's."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah and if we're not ready now, one day isn't going to make a difference." He argued.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, I guess." Ginny said a bit unsure.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't worry gin," Harry said wrapping his arm around her shoulder and taking her bag. "Well have a great day."</p><p class="calibre7">Sent from my iPod</p>
