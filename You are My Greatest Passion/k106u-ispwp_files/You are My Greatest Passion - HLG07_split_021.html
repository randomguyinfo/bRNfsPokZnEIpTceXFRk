			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Nothing to say really, review. huh, im done...lol</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Daniel Radcliffe=VERY GOOD Assuming i own Harry Potter=VERY BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twenty-One</p><p class="calibre7">The wedding was what anyone would have expected from Percy. Everything was in its place at the exact time it needed to be, not a detail was overlooked. He sat at the head table, his robes perfectly pressed next to Audrey, whom Ginny swore was the female reincarnation of Percy himself.</p><p class="calibre7">There was dancing and dinner, perfect portions of course, and soon it was time for the bride and groom to leave. As they waved them away, Harry leaned to whisper in Ginny's ear. "Promise me our wedding will be nothing like this." He chuckled as the car carrying Percy and Audrey disappeared from sight.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny was about to turn and ask him what he meant when Mrs. Weasley began ushering them back around to the apparition point.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ginny sat on Ginny's bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"So I leave in three weeks, but it's only a month of training now. Working with Williamson really helped to put a dent in the time I would spend there." Harry said as he leaned back against her pillow. Ginny looked up at him unsure.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, I been thinking."</p><p class="calibre7">"About what?" Harry asked still looking at her ceiling.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think I might try out for the Harpies." She said as she let out a low breath.</p><p class="calibre7">"Like Holyhead?" he asked looking at her.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded. "Do you think I'd have a chance?" she asked unsure.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled big, "of course I think you have a chance, I haven't seen many women or men that are better than you Ginny." He said sitting up. "When are auditions?"</p><p class="calibre7">"In a month. I have to send in my papers by next Friday if I want to go."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well do you have them all together?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny reached into her bedside table and pulled out a thick pack of papers, which she then handed to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">He thumbed through them for a few moments. "This is really great, Gin." He sat them back in the table.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think you'll do awesome, it's just too bad I won't be here to see you off." Harry said as he rubbed his hands along Ginny's side.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I can think of a few ways for you to make it up to me."</p><p class="calibre7">She leaned down against Harry and their lips met. He rolled them over so that Ginny was lying on her back before running a hand down her chest to clutch at the hem of her shirt briefly before slipping beneath it and up to her breast.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moved her hip against Harry so that he lay between her legs. He brought his hand from her breast to hitch her leg up. He let his hand slowly, yet firmly wander up the outside of her thigh and cupped her bum roughly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny vaguely noticed that her skirt had ridden up around her waist but was too preoccupied with pushing Harry's shirt up his back and the way he was chewing gently at the skin in her neck.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry made to move his hand to the inside of her thigh and his new favorite spot, when Ginny's bedroom door opened.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny dear your Mum says dinâ€¦" Mr. Weasley stopped abruptly when he saw the scene on his daughter's bed, complete with Harry's hand on Ginny's bum, inside the knickers.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry did not even have time to register what was happing; he saw Mr. Weasley in the doorway and practically leapt from the bed to the other side of the room. Ginny just lay calmly on the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well be down in a moment dad," she panted.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, um yes." Arthur said before quickly shutting the door, they could hear him quickly running down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat on the floor and put his head in his hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry what's wrong?" Ginny asked as she walked over to him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his head before chanting. "I'm dead, I'm dead. I survived Voldemort but your Mum's going to kill me."</p><p class="calibre7">"She's not going to kill you," Ginny said as she rubbed his back.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes she is. I can see the headline," he said as he lifted his head and drew it out with his hand, "boy who lived, killed by girlfriends Mum."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed as she placed an arm around Harry, "come on, let's get down to dinner before they suspect something."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Dinner was an awkward affair. Arthur pointedly ignored Harry and Ginny. When Molly pointed out that soon Harry would be working with Arthur, and asked how Arthur felt about this, he disregarded the question and picked up the evening prophet to hide behind.</p><p class="calibre7">"Arthur are you okay?" Molly asked her voice tainted with concern.</p><p class="calibre7">Arthur tentatively peeked over the paper, "What? Oh yes dear just fine." He quickly put out before going back behind the paper; Mrs. Weasley eyed him doubtfully before going back to clearing the table.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry quickly disappeared into the family room with Ron after dinner, hoping to avoid Mr. Weasley at all.</p><p class="calibre7">He and Ron sat playing chess for a while before Ron looked up at Harry. "We did it," he said suddenly. "Me and Hermione."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked confused for a minute, before Ron's words made sense and a look of udder disgust came over his face, "Ugh Ron I don't want to hear about that."</p><p class="calibre7">"But we did, and well I have to tell someone. I rather enjoyed it." He smiled as if proud of himself.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry grimaced "Ron, Hermione's like a sister to me, how would you like it if I told you about how much I enjoy seeing Ginny naked."</p><p class="calibre7">"Not very much I guess." Ron said quietly. They sat for a moment in silence before Ron busted out, "Hey wait a minute you've seen Ginny naked?"</p><p class="calibre7">"See you don't like it very much do you?" Harry asked proving his point.</p><p class="calibre7">"No but, who else was I going to tell?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, but again Hermione's like a sister to me, and I don't particularly want to hear about your sexual exploits."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, I understand." They sat there for a minute, staring at the chessboard.</p><p class="calibre7">"It really was great though." Ron stated again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, God you got to stop." Harry said standing.</p><p class="calibre7">"But Harry, she does this little thing with her tongue;"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry placed his hands over his ears. "I can't hear you." He chanted as he made his way up the stairs and to his room. He looked up to find something, or rather someone he was not expecting to be there.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin what are you doing?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Hiding from Hermione. I guess she and Ron had sex and now she wants to over analyze ever detail, and she wants me to help."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed, "Yeah I just ran from Ron, he kept trying to tell me about it."</p><p class="calibre7">He lay down on the bed next to her and put his hands behind his head. Ginny curled up to his chest.</p><p class="calibre7">"Were not ready for that, are we?" Ginny asked softly, a bit unsure of the answer herself.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry thought for a minute. "No I don't think we are. Nevertheless, I kind of like the pace were going at now. For once in my life, I am comfortable in my surroundings and I like that feeling. I don't want to move to fast and wreck anything either."</p><p class="calibre7">"So you think sex would wreck things?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Not necessarily, but it would make them different, and well, I like the way we are." He kissed the top of her head. "For now." He smirked.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in silence for a moment. "Now that doesn't mean I'm adverse to trying other things." He smiled cheekily down at her. She swatted at him before he pulled her down into a deep kiss.</p><p class="calibre7">After a few minutes, Ginny pulled away. "Harry I'm going to bed." She rose from the bed. Harry made a small whimpering sound.</p><p class="calibre7">"But why?" he complained.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because I don't fancy my dad catching us again." She smiled from the doorway.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh yeah right. Good point." He feigned a yawn, "god Ginny get out of my room already." She laughed at him again before making her way down the hall.</p>
