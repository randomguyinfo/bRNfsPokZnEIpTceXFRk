<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_55">*Chapter 54*: Chapter 54UPDATED</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N UPDATE: Haha, just joshin you, i totally got the year Albus was born wrong, hehe. well the 5 and the 6 are next to each other, lol. I ws wondering why everyone kept saying things about it. lol. sorry, my bad. His correct b-day is November 4th, 2006.</p><p class="calibre7">A/N: and so when I re-read the last chapter I realized that at his age James probably would not have been able to say Hermione, but whatever, I though it worked. Lol. I hope you enjoy this one, I know I've been time jumping a lot, lol. Hope it's okay. I pick my hubby up at the airport friday so hopefully I'll get atleast one more chapter in before my mini-hiatus. Lol. So read, REVIEW and as always enjoy.</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: It's always the same, I do not own Harry Potter.</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter Fifty Four</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Late July 2006</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh ,she's so cute. It's hard to think someone that cute could be the product of Ron." Ginny gushed as she held the little girl.</p><p class="calibre7">She wiggled a bit and slipped from Ginny's grasp onto the floor, before crawling away. "Look at her go. Oh, I remember when James was that little, used to get into everything."</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you talking about, he still does." Hermione laughed. "Besides, you'll get it again soon enough." she laughed patting Ginny's belly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yep, any day now. Albus Severus..." she cringed a bit, she was still having problems getting used to the name.</p><p class="calibre7">"Rose, come here sweetie." Hermione called calmly as the girl tried to open a cabinet. The baby took a longing look at the forbidden territory before dutifully crawling back to her mother.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">November 4th <strong class="calibre4">2006</strong></p><p class="calibre7">"Now I remember why I didn't want more kids," Ginny stated as she laid on the bed, her legs in the air.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just a few more pushes." harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed dramatically, "At least it's not as bad as James," she said calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, Mrs. Potter, the baby seems ready. Let's have one more push, when your ready."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny took a deep breath before she was, for the second time in her life, met with a lightening feeling.</p><p class="calibre7">She became worried when the room stayed silent, "Harry why isn't he crying?" she said clutching at Harry's sleeve.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shrugged as he took the small boy. "I don't know," he laughed. "He just seems to be taking everything in."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled as she took him from Harry's arms. "Oh, he's got your hair. I just hope its not as messy as James'"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">James sat in the waiting room next to his grandmother, tugging furiously at the 'I'm the older brother' jumper she had made him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where's Mummy?" he whined.</p><p class="calibre7">"She's bringing your brother into the world." Molly answered, not for the first time that night.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well can't she hurry? I'm bored, and hungry." he said crossing his arms</p><p class="calibre7">"Just a little while longer." Molly said calmly as she continued her knitting.</p><p class="calibre7">James sighed loudly and slumped in his chair.</p><p class="calibre7">A few minutes later the waiting room door swung open and Harry walked through.</p><p class="calibre7">"Daddy!" James cried, jumping up from his chair and running towards his father.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shhh, James." Harry said as he knelt by the boy. "I want you to meet your new brother, Albus."</p><p class="calibre7">James surveyed him for a minute before scrunching his nose a bit. "He looks funny."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">May 2007</p><p class="calibre7">"James could you help me a bit?" Ginny called across the kitchen. "Carefully of Albus." she said as James ran through the path Albus was crawling</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, Mummy." James asked sweetly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Would you like to help me stir?"</p><p class="calibre7">James nodded vehemently before grabbing the spoon and mixing the cake batter.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny watched as her son stirred the batter, making sure each rotation was exactly the same. Sure she could have set the mix magically, but James loved helping and she enjoyed watching him. And when James was helping, He wasn't getting in trouble.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry walked into the kitchen, setting his briefcase down on the dinning table. He sniffed the air. "Mmm what smells good?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Chocolate cake." James said proudly from his seat on the counter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really? Can I have some?" Harry asked pointing at the mixing spoon, covered in chocolate that James was licking.</p><p class="calibre7">James shook his head. "No, this is mine. You have to ask Mummy if you want one." he reasoned.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded slowly, pretending to be saddened by James denile.</p><p class="calibre7">James sighed loudly. "Okay Daddy, but just one lick." he said holding up a single finger.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled brightly.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny walked back into the kitchen, Albus on her hip. "Oh hey, look at you." she smiled walking over to James. "How did you get on the counter?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm not telling." James smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"He was up there when I came in." Harry defended.</p><p class="calibre7">"You've umm, got..." Ginny giggled while motioning to an area on Harry's face. "Chocolate." she laughed as Harry tired to wipe it off.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why don't you take James upstairs to wash up," she laughed "Dinner will be done in a few minutes."</p><p class="calibre7">They sat at the table eating when Harry sat down his fork a cleared his throat. "So Clowes is retiring." he said conversationally.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really? Why?" Ginny asked as she feed Albus another spoonful.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, he didn't go into a lot of details. I think he might be heading back to America actually." he laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"So whose taking over his position? Is Williamson going to come back?" Ginny questioned endlessly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Actually no. Williamson is staying at Hogwarts."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny set the small spoon down and turned to Harry. "So whose your new Boss?" she asked, her brow furrowed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well actually," Harry began. "<em class="calibre9">I </em>don't have a new boss." he ended before picking up his fork and taking another bite.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny starred at him confused for a minute before gasping. "Oh Harry! You?" she asked and Harry nodded, barely concealing his smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"What happened?" James asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny turned to him. "Your Daddy is now the Boss of <em class="calibre9">all</em> the Aurors." she smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">James in turned smiled and began clapping. "Yeah Daddy!" he clapped over and over again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you James." Harry said before turning back to his plate. He had just started to take a bite when a small clapping caught his attention. He looked up to see Albus clapping slowly and smiling.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">That night Harry sat on the edge of James' bed, carefully tucking him in.</p><p class="calibre7">"So Daddy." James asked. "Are you everyone's Boss?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry laughed as he shook his head. "No, not everyone, just a bunch of people." he pulled the cover a little tighter. "Now, which book would you like tonight?"</p><p class="calibre7">James thought for a moment, story time was important and the book he choose could greatly influence his dreams, and thus next day. "I want the Aunt Hermione book." he smiled big as Harry sighed.</p><p class="calibre7">He made his way over to the shelf and pulled the thick book down. "Okay which story?" he asked opening the front cover.</p><p class="calibre7">()</p><p class="calibre7">"And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death most unwillingly handed over his own <strong class="calibre4">Cloak of Invisibility</strong><strong class="calibre4">"</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">"Daddy," James said suddenly, causing Harry to look up. "Is this a true story?"</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Harry smiled. "Well, I suppose it could be James. Why do you ask?"</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">James smirked mischievously. "Because it would be awesome to have an invisibility cloak."</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Passage Harry reads is from the Tale of Beedle Bard, more specifically 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'. If you do not own Beedle Bard, I suggest you go buy it. It's an awesome addition to the Harry Potter series and benefits charity. PS. I also own a copy of Magical Beast and Where to find them and Quidditch through the Ages. Lol. </strong></p>
