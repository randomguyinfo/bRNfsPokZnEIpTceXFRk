<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_49">*Chapter 48*: Chapter 48</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Okay seriously need your
opinions...how pissed would you be if I did a teeny-tiny time
jump...I'm talking August 2002 to November 2004...There are a couple
of births in there, but I'd do like a mini summary to catch ya
up...idk, you can only write sooo many Weasley births before it gets
repetitive and I really don't want this to get boring...so let me
know. I've got at least one more chapter after this to post before I
go on my mini-Hiatus for hubby being home. So let me know about the
time jump so that I can get the chapters out....te-he and as always
enjoy and review!!!!!!</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: Haha, like 16 days till I
get some=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Forty Eight</p><p class="calibre7">Harry sat idly at his desk, doodling on
a spare piece of parchment. As much as he hated paperwork, he hated
not having anything do to even more.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">This is what you fought for Potter,</em>
he laughed <em class="calibre9"> A world with no bad guys. So don't complain.</em>
He sat his quill down and leaned back in his chair, <em class="calibre9">maybe I
can catch up on so sleep.</em></p><p class="calibre7">He had just dosed
off when the booming laugh of Clowes woke him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Potter, my boy!
Catching up on your sleep?" he laughed as Harry fumbled on his desk
for his glasses.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thats what you
get when you marry a redhead," Clowes laughed again as he nudged
the third person who stood in the doorway that Harry hadn't even
noticed. "Feisty they are."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded
vaguely as he rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Potter I've come
to ask you a bit of a favor. Since your around the same age I thought
maybe you could show young Malfoy here his way around."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry's head
snapped up at the mention of Malfoy and he fully took in the figure
standing at his door. Sure enough there stood, a more matured
version, but still clearly Draco Malfoy.</p><p class="calibre7">Draco
shirted uncomfortably on his heels. "Hello Harry." <em class="calibre9">oh
my goodness, did he just address me as Harry? Ha how things have
changed.</em></p><p class="calibre7">Harry stood to
shake Draco's hand."Good to see you Draco."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ah yes, so you
already know each other. Fabulous!" Clowes clapped his hands
together loudly. "Now Potter, just show him around. Introduce him
to some people, the whole deal." he laughed as he made his way
towards the door. "Oh yes, almost forgot." he said as he turned
back to harry. "Draco will be taking Williamson's office."</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" Harry
asked confused. "Where is Williamson going?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh you haven't
heard." Clowes laughed. "He has decided to become the Hogwart's
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher full time."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded as
Clowes left the office. He sat back down at his desk and motioned for
Draco to sit in one of the over sized chairs.</p><p class="calibre7">They sat for a few
moments in uncomfortable silence.</p><p class="calibre7">"So..." Harry
slurred. "How have you been?" he asked leaning back in his chair.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay I guess.
I've just recently gotten married." Draco said looking down at his
hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really?" Harry
said sitting forward a bit. "To who? Pansy?" Harry recalled them
being a bit more than friendly at Hogwart's.</p><p class="calibre7">Draco made a
disgusted face. "Heavens no. I've tried to push all the negatives
from my life. And believe me she was a major negative." he said
leaning back in the chair. "No, Astoria Greengrass."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry thought for
minute. "Did she have an older sister?"</p><p class="calibre7">Draco nodded.
"Yeah, Daphne. She was in our year. Astoria was two years behind."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really. Thats
great." they sunk into silence again.</p><p class="calibre7">"So..."
Harry started again, determined to try and make this situation as
enjoyable as possible. "What made you want to work here?" <em class="calibre9">Thats
a reasonable question, same thing I'd ask anyone new.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"It's really my
mother. She wants me to do something meaningful in my life. Ever
since, Voldemort fell she's worked hard to get our family back in
good standing and she deserves my help."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded, of
all the things you could describe Narcissa Malfoy as a caring mother
was probably at the top of the list.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not like she
gets much help from my father," he said sourly looking away.
"Besides nobody should have to grow up like I did." he looked
back at Harry. "My entire life I was taught one thing, only to grow
up and find out it was completely wrong and well- a bit ridiculous."</p><p class="calibre7">"Maybe if I help
get the wrong type of people in this world locked up, no other child
will have to grow up with that type of pressure."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded, he
seriously never through Draco could be that deep. It almost made him
laugh a bit. The man sitting in front of him was a far cry from the
student he had known at Hogwart's.</p><p class="calibre7">"I can understand
that."</p><p class="calibre7">They sat in silence
for a bit before it became to much for Harry to stand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, let me
show you around." he stood and made for the door. "Oh, did you
meet Sophie yet?"</p><p class="calibre7">Draco nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, well
whatever you do, don't let Astoria get on her bad side." he
shuddered. "It makes for a very interesting situation."</p><p class="calibre7">"What did
Weaslett... I mean Ginny, have it in with her?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded.
"Almost punched her in the face." he laughed before opening the
door and heading into the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p><p class="calibre7">"You'll never
believe who I spoke to today." Harry said as they sat down to
dinner.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny managed to
ask 'who' through her mouthful of food.</p><p class="calibre7">"Draco Malfoy.
He's working in the Auror office." Harry said calmly as he scooped
a spoonful of potatoes onto his plate.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny actually
choke on her food. She took a minute to swallow and take a drink.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your joking
right?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his
head. "Nope, Clowes asked me to show him around."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stared at
harry gob smacked. "Really? They let a Malfoy back in the
Ministry?" she laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin, I think
he's changed. I don't know he's just different. You know he's
married."</p><p class="calibre7">"Pansy?" she
asked, sure of her answer.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nope." Ginny
looked at him wide eyed. "Astoria Greengrass, class after yours."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really, she was
relatively nice, for a Slytherin." she said tentatively taking a
bite of her food.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded.
"Beside, he's not doing field work. His job merely consist of
paperwork and filing." Harry shuddered. "I'd really hate to be
him." he laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny peaked her
head into the flat, looking cautiously for Harry. When she was
positive he wasn't there she slipped into the flat, mindful of her
newly broken hand.</p><p class="calibre7">She had had a nasty
run in with a stray bludger that day at practice, and while it barely
even hurt anymore and the medi-witch had assured her it would heal
before the next match, she didn't want Harry freaking out over it.</p><p class="calibre7">She made her way
into the bedroom and opened the closet door. She pushed through the
clothes before coming to rest on one she was looking for. She pulled
Harry's button up shirt on and stretched out her arms. She smiled
brightly when the sleeves came to rest just past her fingertips,
relevantly covering her cast. Happy with her plan and thoughtfulness
she headed into the kitchen to fix dinner.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stepped out
of the floo and collapsed onto the couch, he hated trial days. He
pulled his hat off and looked at it in his hand.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Stupid thing. </em>he
thought as he turned it over in his hand. <em class="calibre9">Reminds me of
something Umbridge would wear.</em></p><p class="calibre7">With a sigh he
heaved himself off the couch and towards the kitchen, leaving the
distasteful accessory sitting there.</p><p class="calibre7">"Smells good."
he commented as he took a seat at the small kitchen table. "What is
it?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny laughed.
"Chicken, but I'm cooking it a new way."</p><p class="calibre7">"By what wearing
over sized clothes." he laughed. "Is that my shirt?" he asked,
taking in the shirt.</p><p class="calibre7">"Maybe." Ginny
said cheekily, not looking up from the pan. "It's a bit chilly in
here, don't you think?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No. not really."
Harry said humorlessly.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">damn, he's right, should have turned
the air down.</em> Ginny though as
she lifted the last of the chicken out of the pan.</p><p class="calibre7">She took her seat
next to Harry and carefully began plating her food.</p><p class="calibre7">She listen
halfheartedly as Harry rambled about the trial, picking at the
chicken occasionally.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you done?"
Ginny asked as Harry set his fork down and leaned back in the chair.
Harry nodded as he let out a long sigh.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny reached
across the small table for Harry's plate, her sleeve riding up just
slightly.</p><p class="calibre7">"What the hell's
that?" Harry asked grabbing for her hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing."
Ginny said as she snatched it away and headed for the sink. She
dropped the dishes in gingerly and set them washing before she felt
Harry behind her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on Gin,
what happened." he asked wrapping one arm around her waist and
reaching for her hand with the other.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's nothing
Harry. Just a little accident." she said turning to face him.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded slowly
as he lifted her sleeve, slowly revealing the cast covered in Harpies
signatures.</p><p class="calibre7">"How did it
happed?" he asked running a finger over the plaster.</p><p class="calibre7">"Stray Bludger."
Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre7">"Does it hurt."</p><p class="calibre7">"Not anymore, and
it should be off before the end of the week."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded again
as he carefully brought her hand up to kiss her fingertips.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why didn't you
just tell me." he asked softly, lifting his head to look at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, I thought
you'd be upset." Ginny blushed.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded.
"Well, I guess I kind of am. I mean I hate to see you hurt," he
kisses her fingers again. "But well, Bludgers happen." he laughed
as he pushed his glasses back up his nose.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny pulled her
hand back and placed them on her hips. "Thats not what you said
last time."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well last
time you got put into 's."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, well.
Yeah." Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">She dropped her
arms and moved into him. Harry laughed as he wrapped his arms around
her.</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you Gin."</p><p class="calibre7">"I love you too
Harry."</p>
