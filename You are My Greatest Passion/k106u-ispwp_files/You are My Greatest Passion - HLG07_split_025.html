He had gotten off work early to change and meet Ginny at the stadium. He watched as the team landed and began heading toward the dressing rooms. He headed toward the pitch through the entrance tunnel. He watched Ginny and waited until she caught sight of him. When she did, she beamed and started running full speed towards him. He vaguely registered the amount of mud on her practice robes, but paid it no mind. When she reached him and engulfed him in a tight hug, he lifted her into the air and kissed her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry what are you doing here?" she asked clearly surprised.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just thought I'd surprise you. I've got dinner reservations and everything." He smiled at her, clearly proud of himself.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh really Mr. Potter, that's great. I've got big news for you." She smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Really? Get dressed and you can tell me when we get there." Harry said pushing her towards the dressing room. He did a quick cleansing spell on his robes where Ginny had gotten them muddy. By time he was done, Ginny was walking out of the dressing room towards him.</p><p class="calibre7">"So where are we going?" she asked as soon as she reached him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm not telling." Harry said grabbing her hand and walking out by the apparation point.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well how am I supposed to get there?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"With this amazing concept called side-along apparation." Harry joked. He pulled her into a tight hug and whisked them away.</p><p class="calibre7">When they arrived, a second later Ginny looked around but did not recognize the surroundings.</p><p class="calibre7">"Where are we?" she asked as they walked out of the alley they had apparated in to.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's a muggle restaurant; I didn't want to go anywhere where we could be interrupted." He told her as he held the restaurant door open for her.</p><p class="calibre7">They stepped inside and the strong scent of pasta and basil hit her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oo, Italian. Good, I'm really hungry." Ginny said as the host showed them to their booth.</p><p class="calibre7">"Wow everything looks so good. Doesn't it Harry?' she asked as she looked over the menu.</p><p class="calibre7">When harry did not answer, she placed her hand on his. "Is something wrong?" she asked concerned.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, no." he answered quickly. "Sorry just thinking."</p><p class="calibre7">Dinner arrived and they ate in silence for a few moments.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," "Harry," they both spoke at the same time.</p><p class="calibre7">"Go ahead, you first." Harry said.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, you set everything for dinner, you first."</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny," Harry drew her name out. "Seriously, tell me what you wanted."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed, but did not sound at all disappointed. "Okay. Well when I got to practice Lucy asked to see me in the office." Harry made a face; Ginny had introduced him to Lucy early on. She was second in charge in Harpies management. "Yeah, that's how I felt. But she sat me down and," she made a drum roll sound on the table. "They offered me a chance to play starting line!" she nearly shouted. "I get to go on tour with them and everything! Isn't that amazing?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry stared blankly at her for a minute. Ginny gone. On tour. He fingered the small box in his pocket.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry did you hear me?"</p><p class="calibre7">He snapped out of his reverie. "Huh oh yeah. That's um, that's really great Gin." He plastered on a fake smile, which fortunately Ginny seemed to accept.</p><p class="calibre7">"Now what were you going to say?" she asked taking a drink of her soda.</p><p class="calibre7">He let his fingers go over the box once again before bringing his hand back up to the table, empty.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh I just wanted to know what you wanted for dessert."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh. I don't know I was thinking theTiramisu." she said picking up her menu once again.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ron stood a little way inside of Harry's room, watching Harry angrily throw things into boxes.</p><p class="calibre7">"I still don't understand why your moving." Ron stated for what felt like the hundredth time.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ron, I've already explained it to you. I can't stay here anymore; I mean god I'm nineteen, that's even of age for a muggle." He huffed as he examined a few items before he threw them too, into the box.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, but why all of a sudden, I mean," he whispered close, "everything was fine. What happened between you and Ginny? I thought you were going to ask her?" Ron questioned.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah well, things change."</p><p class="calibre7">Ron just nodded as he leaned against the doorway. He was determined not to help Harry with his tiraid.</p><p class="calibre7">"What's going on?" Ginny asked as she entered the room. She surveyed the room and took in all the boxes. "Where are you going Harry?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I've bought a flat in Diagon alley. I'm moving in tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at him hurt. "Why?" she was barely audible.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because it's time for me to grow up. I cannot keep having your Mum take care of me. Besides, Ron's moving in with George and with you on tour all the timeâ€¦" he let his sentence trail off.</p><p class="calibre7">"And what about when I'm not on tour?'</p><p class="calibre7">"Im sure you'll find time to visit." He said sharply as he pushed past them, taking the last of the boxes down stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny looked at Ron and the pained look in her eyes tugged at his heartstrings. He pulled her into a hug.</p><p class="calibre7">"Don't worry gin, it'll be okay.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry lay in Percy's old bed for the last time, staring at the ceiling and wondering how things had changed so fast. Deep down he knew he should be happy for Ginny, but a big part of him felt as if she was leaving him behind. He furiously rubbed his face, and when the door opened he didn't even bother looking over, he could already tell who it was by the way the room changed. The very air seemed to take on a different quality, and it began to smell like broomsticks and something floral.</p><p class="calibre7">He felt the bed lean just slightly as Ginny sat down.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry, are you okay?" she asked quietly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Bloody fantastic." He answered sarcastically.</p><p class="calibre7">"What's wrong? Are you mad at me for making starting line?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No Ginny."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well what is it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing," he said rolling over. "I'm going to sleep."</p><p class="calibre7">"I leave at one for the first game tomorrow." Ginny said ignoring his comment about sleep.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I guess I'll see you when you get back." Harry replied dryly.</p><p class="calibre7">"You're not going to come see it? Ron's apparating out." She said with a great amount of hurt in her voice.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, I'm going to be pretty busy with work and unpacking."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well fine then." Ginny nearly yelled, getting up from the bed. "If you want to be all pissy go ahead I could care less." She slammed the door and Harry could hear her stomping all the way to her room.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry arrived at his new apartment a little past five, he had moved all of his belongings over the night before and he had just gotten off work. He slowly walked around the flat. It was so white, and quite. He peeked into the kitchen, but no homey smells met his nose. Frustrated and upset he made his way to the room he had designated as his. He lay down on the bed. Even it felt wrong, it was not worn from years of previous occupants, and it was so big that he could stretch completely and not have to worry about his feet dangling. In other words, it was dreadful. He stared up at the ceiling and let his thoughts wander for a moment before reaching into his pocket and pulling out his mothers ring. The ring that was supposed to be Ginny's before everything got fucked up. He opened the box and starred at it. It was in plain words perfect for her, simple enough for her personality, yet big enough to let people know how much she was cared about. Harry sighed before shutting the box and setting it on the stack of boxes next to the bed. He had resigned to carrying it around the past few days but was determined not to burden his mind with it anymore.</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: oh, and sorry about ending it here, but i had to leave you guessing right? lol. Now hit the nice review button, yep there you go....lol</strong></p>
