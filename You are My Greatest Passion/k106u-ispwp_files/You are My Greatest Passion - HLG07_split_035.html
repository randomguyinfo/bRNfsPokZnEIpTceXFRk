			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: OMG GUESS WHAT? EXACTLY A MONTH AGO THIS STORY WAS FIRST POSTED! HEHE. okay so im celebration, Chapter Thirty-Five. It's kinda of short, but it gets us where were going sooo.....yeah. read and review.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Also i have the Birthday list done. It's at the end of this chapter. Im posting the complete list since it may be some time before the charaters are . </strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty-Five</p><p class="calibre7">"Seamus Finnigan?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes,"</p><p class="calibre7">"Dean Thomas?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes,"</p><p class="calibre7">"Lavender Brown?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes, do you really think it's wise to invite her? With the whole history between her and Ron?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why would it matter? He's with Hermione now."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay," Ginny sighed as she continued to go through the invitations for their wedding.</p><p class="calibre7">She handed another envelope to one of the owls they had rented from Eeylops Owl Emporium.</p><p class="calibre7">"Can you believe there is less than a week till Christmas?" she asked conversationally.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I know times just flying by. Did you get all the presents bought?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I picked up the last of them yesterday." She said addressing another invitation.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on gin, were going to be late as is." Harry called through the small flat.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm coming." Ginny said as she walked down the hall, still taking rollers out of her hair.</p><p class="calibre7">"How do I look?" she asked as she set the roller down and did a little spin.</p><p class="calibre7">"Amazing." He said as he gave her a small kiss. "Can we go now? We still have to get Teddy."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and the stepped into the floo and out into the living room of Andromeda Tonks.</p><p class="calibre7">"Teddy," Ginny called and small footsteps could be heard running through the house.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny!" he called as he ran into her open arms, Andromeda right behind him with his bag.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hey Teddy bear, how are you?"</p><p class="calibre7">He pointed to his finger, where a band-aid was. "Boo-boo."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, how terrible. Here let me kiss it better." She said as she placed a small kiss on the finger.</p><p class="calibre7">"What no hug for me?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Hi harry." He said excitedly, trying to maneuver his was out of Ginny's arms and into Harry's.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you ready to go Teddy?" Harry asked and Teddy nodded. "See you later Andromeda." Harry waved as they stepped into the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yea!" teddy yelled as he clapped his hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry do you really think that's an appropriate toy for a toddler?" Molly asked motioning at the small broom.</p><p class="calibre7">"My parents got me one when I was a year." He reasoned. Molly made a disapproving face as she headed back into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre7">"Can I try?" Teddy asked holding the small broom up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not right now Teddy," Ginny said calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Why?" teddy asked, disappointment evident in his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because it's too cold outside and we can fly indoors." She explained.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay," teddy sighed before going back to his other toys.</p><p class="calibre7">A while later Harry deposited a sleeping Teddy into Andromeda's arms. "Do you want me to take the toys to his room?" he asked in hushed tones.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, just leave it there. I'll get it later."</p><p class="calibre7">"You sure?" Harry asked setting the bag down.</p><p class="calibre7">"Positive Harry. Go home get some rest. It's been a long night." She smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay. If your sure." He said heading towards the floo. "Oh and Andromeda," She looked up. "Merry Christmas."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">"How it going harry?" Ginny called from the living room of their flat, where she was levitating the last of the streamers into place.</p><p class="calibre7">"Not so good actually." He responded.</p><p class="calibre7">She made her way to the kitchen, and could not help but laugh at the scene. Harry was wearing the old apron her mother had given her and had flour on his nose. He was looking disappointedly and confused at the collapsed cake on the counter in front of him.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't understand what happened. I did what the book said."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny walked over and tasted the cake. While she was nowhere near the cooking enthusiast her mother was, she did find herself rather fond of baking treats and the like.</p><p class="calibre7">She grimaced. "Did you add baking powder?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre7">"Baking powder?" Harry looked at her confused. He looked down at the book and read it closely. "Oh, is there a difference between that and baking soda?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded vehemently. "There's the problem, that's why it collapsed."She explained. "And doesn't taste the best," She laughed. "here I'll help you make a new one." She said quickly cleaning away the mess and getting out new ingredients.</p><p class="calibre7">An hour later Ginny was finishing the 'y' on the top of the cake when she heard the familiar call of her brother.</p><p class="calibre7">"Need any help?" Ron asked as he leaned against the kitchen door jamb.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nah, I'm almost finished here."</p><p class="calibre7">"You sure?" she nodded as Hermione came by his side. "Where would you like the presents?" she asked motioning to the box in her hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"The table by the window please." Ginny said waving her wand to clean up the mess. "He should be here any moment. Are Mum in Dad on their way?" she asked levitating a few platters of finger foods into the living room.</p><p class="calibre7">As if they had heard her question, Molly followed by Arthur stepped out of the floo. "Is he here yet?" Molly asked looking around.</p><p class="calibre7">"No Mum, not yet."</p><p class="calibre7">"Good dear. Now where are presents going?"</p><p class="calibre7">A little while later, they all stood round the floo waiting for the birthday boy to appear. The flames grew green and Ginny bounced excitedly next to harry, before they all shouted. 'Happy birthday Teddy!'</p><p class="calibre7">The young child's eyes grew wide and he smiled at them all before running to give Ginny, then Harry a hug.</p><p class="calibre7">"Teddy's party?" he asked looking up at them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes teddy, this party is just for you."</p><p class="calibre7">He jumped up and down before running back to Andromeda and marching her around the room to look at the decorations. They munched on the small foods Ginny had set out while Teddy began to open his gifts.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yea, truck." He said holding up Ron and Hermione's gift, before exclaiming, "Truck go vroom."</p><p class="calibre7">Everyone laughed as he moved onto the next box. "Ewe," he said as he examined the present inside. Molly just beamed from her seat. He pulled the small sweater from the box and held it up. "Like Harry." He said proudly. He finished opening his gift and soon Ginny exclaimed. "Time for cake." She ran off to the kitchen and Harry dimmed the lights.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny remerged, chocolate cake in hand, this time two candles sat on top. Teddy bounced excitedly in his seat as Ginny made her way toward him. They sang happy birthday before Teddy excitedly blew out the candles, with a little help from Andromeda.</p><p class="calibre7">They ate cake and talked of mundane things before Teddy said aloud. "Teddy sleepy." As if trying to prove his point he yawned wide and laid his head against Andromeda.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think it's time we got going." She said softly stroking his hair, which turned a content blue. She gathered him in her arms and stepped into the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">Ron chose that moment to come up behind Harry. "So any plans for tonight?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry shook his head. "Well how bout we go out. The four of us. It was my birthday a couple weeks ago you know."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, Ron I know. Your Mum threw you a party." Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on," Ron pleaded.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, let me just talk to Ginny. Is she's alright going out, then so am I."</p><p class="calibre7">Birthday Fanfiction:</p><p class="calibre7">1. Theo3983 July 30th 2001-Molly Marie (P/A).
