<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_64">*Chapter 63*: Chapter 63</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">A/N: Hello, You have no clue how sad I
am about posting this. The final chapter. Hrm. Kind of depressing,
but in an accomplished way. I hope you have enjoyed this and I want
to thank everyone who accompained me on this amazing journey. Please
keep an eye out for my other stories, soon to come and the sequel to
this, The Book of James Sirius Potter. Again thank you and please
review!</p><p class="calibre7">Also, the italic part of this story is
taken from JKR's Deathly Hallows.</p><p class="calibre7">Disclaimer: Last Chapter=Sad, but Good.
Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</p><p class="calibre7">James stood in the secret passage way
that led out into the corridor that led to Gryffindor tower.</p><p class="calibre7">Held tightly in his hands was the
Marauders map that he had acquired several months earlier.</p><p class="calibre7">Exams were over and he needed to blow
off some steam, god knew he hadn't done as good as he wanted and he
really needed a good prank to cheer him up.</p><p class="calibre7">He watched as the little dot slowly
made its way closer to where he was hidden. He quietly slipped the
mask over his face, and after taking one last look at the map,
slipped it away into his back pocket.</p><p class="calibre7">He stood silently, The edge of the
tapestry tightly gripped in his hand.</p><p class="calibre7">He counted softly. "Five..." Foot
step, "Four..." a little closer. "Three..." Almost there.
"Two..." Just a few more steps. "One."</p><p class="calibre7">James swiftly pulled back the curtain
and jumped out from his hiding spot. "RAWR!" He screamed waving
his hands wildly.</p><p class="calibre7">The small red-headed girl shrieked in
fear as she dropped the pile of books she had been carrying.</p><p class="calibre7">James began to laugh hysterically as he
pulled the mask up over his face.</p><p class="calibre7">The girl narrowed her eyes sharply
before picking up one of her discarded books and swiftly hitting
James atop the head with it.</p><p class="calibre7">"James. Potter. You. Prat." she
yelled, accentuating every work with the swat of her book.</p><p class="calibre7">"Reese, Stop, Ouch. That one really
hurt." James cried as she hit him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ms. Finnigan, What in the world are
you doing?" Professor McGonagall said sharply from behind them,
They hadn't even heard her approaching.</p><p class="calibre7">Reese looked up at the professor,
wide-eyed. "It wasn't my fault." She cried. "James, he scared
me."</p><p class="calibre7">James still lay on the floor,
snickering.</p><p class="calibre7">McGonagall sighed. "Mr. Potter, it's
the last day of the year. Did you really feel the need to cause
trouble." She looked at James before quickly adding. "Don't
answer that question. Just please, no more problems. Now off, both of
you. I'm sure you have packing to do."</p><p class="calibre7">She watched as they gathered Reese's
books and made their way down the hall, Reese smacking James once
more for good measure.</p><p class="calibre7">She sighed and shook her head. She was
getting too old for this.</p><p class="calibre7">James ran full force towards his
parents. He had officially survived him first year at Hogwarts and
was excited for the summer. He smiled brightly as Teddy made his way
over.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry placed a hand on Teddy's
shoulder. "So how does it feel?"</p><p class="calibre7">Teddy shrugged his shoulders.
"Different, I guess." His eyes wandered to the left of the
platform where Bill and Fleur were greeting their eldest daughter.</p><p class="calibre7">"Um, Uncle Harry. I know I said I
needed a ride home, but would you mind if I went with Victorie. I
mean, I told her I'd help her get a head start on her NEWTS." he
said quickly.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled and nodded before Teddy
headed off.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny leaned over, "Getting a
headstart on NEWTS? Is that what their calling it now days?" She
laughed as Harry looked at her incredulously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on," he sighed. "Lets head
home before your mother embarrasses someone." He said as he led
them out of the station.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mother." Albus sighed. "It is
vital to be prepared! You never know what could happen." He
stressed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Albus," Ginny started for the
third time. "You do not need that many quills, We can send you more
you know. Your not going to go through ten before you get there."</p><p class="calibre7">Albus shook his head woefully. "You
just don't understand."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny sighed. She and Albus had been
sitting in front of his new trunk for two hours now attempting to
pack it.</p><p class="calibre7">She had already had to talking him out
of taking all 20 pairs of sock and a second parka, and now he was on
about school supplies and how one can never be too prepared.</p><p class="calibre7">She sighed deeply. How had one of her
children turned out so like Percy and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked over at Albus who had his
arms crossed protestingly across his chest. She sighed again. "Pack
what you want. I'm going to check on James."</p><p class="calibre7">She stood and wandered across the hall
to her eldest son's bedroom. Unlike Albus, James was never overly
prepared. He always seemed to take the right amount of supplies and
clothes. The only problem was that he also tried to take various
forbidden objects.</p><p class="calibre7">She opened the door and James jumped
before hiding his hands behind his back.</p><p class="calibre7">"James," She sighed, "What are
you trying to smuggle?"</p><p class="calibre7">James looked at her defeated before
revealing a large box of nosebleed nougats.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shook her head. "If Filtch
catches you with them, don't say I didn't warn you."</p><p class="calibre7">James broke into a smile before
stashing the box in his trunk. "I think I'm about done Mum. Do you
want to check it?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny glanced at her sons trunk. She
could see the end of what see assumed was a Filabuster Firework
poking out. She shook her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'd rather not, then I can
truthfully claim that I didn't know about any of it."</p><p class="calibre7">James laughed loudly before shutting
the lid of his trunk and locking it.</p><p class="calibre7">He sat atop it and Ginny plopped down
next to him. She sighed deeply and closed her eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"You alright Mum?" James asked
seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes." Ginny said her eyes still
closed. "Just, your brother."</p><p class="calibre7">She didn't need to finish her sentence.
"Wanting to be over prepared?" James asked.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny opened her eyes and nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">"It'll be okay. I'll watch over him."
James smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, that's what I'm worried
about." she smiled softly before leaving the room and a laughing
James behind.</p><p class="calibre7">"Lily, Grab a sweater. It's chilly
this morning" Ginny called up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre7">James tumbled into view his trunk
smacking against the stairs as he did so. "You couldn't have waited
for your father?" Ginny asked placing her hands on her hips.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your looking like Grandmum again."
James smirked before dissappearing into the livingroom and leaving
his mother to ponder just when she had picked up the habit.</p><p class="calibre7">She walked into the living room and
into chaos.</p><p class="calibre7">"But I want to go to." Lily whinned
as she held a small bag in her arms and a book about Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre7">"Your still too young sweetie."
Harry was explaining calmly.</p><p class="calibre7">James and Albus were by the door and
from the look on their faces they were fighting.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moved towards them hoping to
avoid conflict.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are we all ready to go?" She asked
hopeful.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry nodded vigourously before helping
to coral their children into the car waiting in the drive.</p><p class="calibre7">While Ginny positioned Ginny between
the boys Harry descretly enlarged the trunk to fit the boy's stuff.</p><p class="calibre7">He sighed as he plopped down into the
drive seat beside's Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">As the headed towards London James
casually spoke up.</p><p class="calibre7">"Al I hope you'll be able to find the
common room."</p><p class="calibre7">Albus looked at his brother confused.
"But, why would I have a problem? Won't you show me?" He asked
alittle scared.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well yes I would, But I have no clue
where the Slytherin common room is." James smirked.</p><p class="calibre7">Albus huffed indignetly as his face
turned red. "I will not be in Slytherin."</p><p class="calibre7">James shook his head. "You never
know." He nearly sang.</p><p class="calibre7">"Boys." Harry warned as he pulled
into the lot next to the train station.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Autumn seemed to arrive
suddenly that year. The morning of the</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">first
of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">little
family bobbed across the rumbling road towards the great</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">sooty
station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians
sparkled</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">like
cobwebs in the cold air. Two large caged rattled on top of the laden
trolleys</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">the
parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and
the</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">redheaded
girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father's
arm.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">It
won't be long now, and you'll be going too," Harry told her.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Two
years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go now!"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">The
commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">towards
the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus's voice drifted
back</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">to
Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">they
had started in the car.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">I
won't! I won't
be in Slytherin!"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">James,
give it a rest!" said Ginny.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">I
only said he might be," said
James, grinning at his younger brother.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">There's
nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slyth—"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">But
James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters
approached</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">the
barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">brother,
James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">later,
he had vanished.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">You'll
right to me, won't you?" Albus asked his parents immediately,
capitalizing</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">on
the momentary absence of his brother.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Every
day, if you want us to," said Ginny.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Not
every day," said Albus
quickly. "James says most people only get letters</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">from
home about once a month."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">We
wrote to James three times a week last year," said Ginny.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">And
you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Harry
put in. "He likes a laugh, your brother."</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Side
by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">they
reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead,
the</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">family
emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">thick
white steam which was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express.
Indistinct</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">figures
were swarming through the mist, into which James had already</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">disappeared.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Where
are they?" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">passed
as they made their way down the platform</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">We'll
find them," said Ginny reassuringly.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">But
the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's
faces.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Detached
from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">he
heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was
quite</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">glad
of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . .</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">I
think that's them, Al," said Ginny suddenly.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">A
group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the
very</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">last
carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily,
and</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Albus
had drawn right up beside them.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Hi,"
said Albus, sounding immensely relieved.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Rose,
who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">him.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Parked
all right, then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't
believe</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">I
could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to
Confund</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">the
examiner."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">No,
I didn't," said Hermione, "I had complete faith in you."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">As
a matter of fact, I did Confund
him," Ron whispered to Harry, as together</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">they
lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. "I only forgot to
look in</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">the
wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for
that."</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Back
on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother,</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">having
an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">when
they finally went to Hogwarts.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">If
you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," said Ron, "but
no pressure."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Ron!"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Lily
and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">He
doesn't mean it," said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">paying
attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">fifty
yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people
stood</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">in
sharp relief against the shifting mist.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Look
who it is."</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Draco
Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">up
to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">the
pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Harry.
Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him,</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">nodded
curtly, and turned away again.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">So
that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure
you beat</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">him
in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's
brains."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Ron,
for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused.
"Don't try</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">to
turn them against each other before they've even started school!"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">You're
right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added,
"Don't</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">get
too friendly with him, though,
Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">you
if you married a pureblood."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Hey!"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">James
had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and
trolley,</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">and
was evidently bursting with news.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Teddy's
back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">into
the billowing clouds of steam. "Just seen him! And guess what he's
doing?</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Snogging
Victoire!"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">He
gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of
reaction.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Our
Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging
our Victoire! Our
cousin! And I asked</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Teddy
what he was doing—"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">You
interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so
like Ron—"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"—<em class="calibre9">and
he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away!</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">He's
snogging her!" James added as
though worried he had not made himself</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">clear.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Oh,
it would be lovely if they got married," whispered Lily
sarcastically.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Teddy
would really be part of the
family then!"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">He
already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said
Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Why
don't we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Yeah!"
said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing a room with</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Al—Teddy
could have my room!"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">No,"
said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want
the</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">house
demolished."</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">He
checked the battered old watch which had once been Fabian Prewett's.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">It's
nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Don't
forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged
him.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Mum!
I can't give a professor love!"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">But
you know Neville!—"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">James
rolled his eyes.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Outside,
yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">walk
into Herbology and give him love.
. . . "</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Shaking
his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by
aiming</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">a
kick at Albus.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">See
you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">I
thought they were invisible? You said
they were invisible!"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">But
James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his
father</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">a
fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">wave,
then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Thestrals
are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">things,
there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up
to</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">school
in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats."</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Ginny
kissed Albus good-by.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">See
you at Christmas."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">By,
Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's
invited</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">you
to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone
till you've</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">learned
how. And don't let James wind you up."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">What
if I'm in Slytherin?"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">The
whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">of
departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere
that fear</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">was.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Harry
crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own.
Alone</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">of
Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Albus
Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear,</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">and
she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now
on</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">the
train, "you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them
was</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">a
Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">But
just say—"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"—<em class="calibre9">then
Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it?</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">It
doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be
able to choose</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Gryffindor
over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account."</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Really?"</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">It
did for me," said Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">He
had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder
in</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Albus's
face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">scarlet
train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">final
kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and
Ginny</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">closed
the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">them.
A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be
turned</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">towards
Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Why
are they staring?" demanded
Albus as he and Rose craned around to</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">look
at the other students.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Don't
let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me. I'm extremely famous."</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Albus,
Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">walked
alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with
excitement.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Harry
kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little
bereavement,</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">watching
his son glide away from him. . . .</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">The
last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">corner.
Harry's hand was still raised in farewell.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">He'll
be all right," murmured Ginny.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">As
Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">the
lightning scar on his forehead.</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">I
know he will."</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">The
scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.</em></p>
