<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_25">*Chapter 24*: Chapter 24</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: nothing new, review.</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Me uploading two Chapters in one day=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p class="calibre7">"You made it?" Ron exclaimed. "You actually made the Harpies?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded eagerly at her brother. Her Mum and Dad beamed from their seats at the table.</p><p class="calibre7">"Do you know what this means?" Ron continued.</p><p class="calibre7">"That I have to be at practice three days a week and a weekend every month?" Ginny asked knowing this wasn't the answer Ron was looking for.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, well yes but that's not what I was talking about." He pushed his butterbeer away, "You" he pointed at Ginny, "Can get me," he pointed at himself, "Season tickets. Then not only will I get to go to all the Cannons games I want, but Harpies too. I'll get to see every team in the league play." He beamed at the idea.</p><p class="calibre7">"Who says I'm going to give you tickets? I only get a limited number you know." Ginny shot at Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I just assumed, with me being your favorite brother and all."</p><p class="calibre7">"Who says you're my favorite brother?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Im not your favorite?" Ron asked, he looked at Ginny as if she had taken his favorite toy away.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh shut it Ron,"</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny language." Molly scolded. Ginny had almost entirely forgotten her parents were there.</p><p class="calibre7">"What I meant," she said moving her gaze back to Ron. "Is let me see how many tickets I get, then I will figure it out."</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione apparated over just before dinner, like she had for the past few weeks.</p><p class="calibre7">After dinner, the four sat out by the pond on the edge of the burrow. Ron had set a small bonfire and they sat around drinking butterbeers and reminiscing. Somewhere around midnight Ginny had fallen asleep on Harry's shoulder. He carefully lifted her into his arms as he said a quick good bye to Hermione.<br class="calibre6"/>He carried Ginny up to her room and carefully sat her on her bed. She awoke as he removed his arms from around her. She reached up and wrapped her arms around his neck pulled him back down to her. She kissed him sloppily.<br class="calibre6"/>"Harry I love you" she mumbled still in her sleepy state. She kissed him again before he pushed away.<br class="calibre6"/>"Ginny I have to get to sleep"<br class="calibre6"/>"why?" Ginny asked propping herself up on her arms.<br class="calibre6"/>"Because I have to go to work tomorrow. And I floo in with your Dad, who for some reason<br class="calibre6"/>likes to be there an hour early." he laughed as he gave her a kiss on the forehead.<br class="calibre6"/>"I love you, see you at dinner tomorrow." he walked down the hall to his room and fell asleep.</p><p class="calibre7">The next day was dreadfully boring without harry. Ginny sat at the kitchen table tracing a scratch in the table with her finger. She glanced at her watch again. Only five minutes had passed since she last checked.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Gods, I am going to drive myself bloody insane.</em></p><p class="calibre7">She got up and walked over to the cupboard.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Maybe a cup of tea will help me keep my mind off the time.</em></p><p class="calibre7">After her tea was gone and the cup was clean and back in the cupboard, she chanced a glance at her watch.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Damn it, only </em>twenty<em class="calibre9"> minutes? I even did it the muggle way!</em></p><p class="calibre7">She hit her fist on the table but all it did was leave her in pain.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Maybe if I take a nap. </em>She thought as she climbed the stairs to her room.</p><p class="calibre7">"I've missed you." Ginny awoke to hot breath on her neck. She moved her head from where it was buried in the pillow to see who it was.</p><p class="calibre7">She looked up to see Harry, still in his burgundy work robes, leaning over her.<br class="calibre6"/>He gave her a short kiss.<br class="calibre6"/>"Your Mum says dinner is ready."</p><p class="calibre7">"How long have you been back?" Ginny asked, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just got here, I was kind of upset when you didn't meet me in the kitchen. But your Mum said you were up here taking a nap." He laughed. "Are you channeling Ron today? I've never seen you nap during the day." He asked looking at her suspiciously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Just trying to find a way to pass the time." She added half heartedly as she got out of bed. "So how was work?"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Several weeks passed and Ginny was happy when practices started up and she had something to fill her day while Harry was gone. They soon fell into a very comfortable routine. Ginny would arrive back from practice just in time to clean up and help her Mum with the dinner, and Harry would arrive just in time to eat it. They would spend the night hanging out with Ron and Hermione or alone in Ginny's room, exploring the knowledge they learned from the books they had acquired.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry and Ron sat by the pond on the edge of the burrow, the girls splashing a few yards away in the cool water.</p><p class="calibre7">"George asked me to come help him at the shop," Ron said suddenly looking down at his hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"Are you going to do it?" Harry asked, he knew Ron had once had dreams of becoming an Auror as well.</p><p class="calibre7">"I think I might, withoutâ€¦ Fred, George has to manage the place all by himself. If I help take some of that pressure off, he can spend more time inventing products." Ron finished with a sigh.</p><p class="calibre7">"What about the Auror training. You got the NEWT's you need."</p><p class="calibre7">"Yeah, I know. And part of me still wants to do that, but I don't know. I feel like maybe I need to do this first. Beside, I've always enjoyed their pranks. Well when I wasn't on the receiving end." He laughed. "Maybe in a few years, I'll go do the training." He looked thoughtfully out at the water. "What about you, now that you're Mister big bad Auror, any changes in the near future?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked over the water at Ginny. Her hair seemed to be on fire in the slowly setting sun. He watched as she swam around for a bit and splashed at Hermione, before she looked towards the shore. She noticed Harry watching her and waved. Harry waved back at her and smiled.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know Ron, but I'd like it too."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">That night Harry sat in his room alone, the small wooden box from his vault on his bed.</p><p class="calibre7">He slowly opened the box, and pulled out a smaller one. He sat staring at the small green box. He rubbed his finger against it; the velvet was aged but still soft. He gave a long sigh before placing it into the pocket of his robes and turning off the light.</p>
