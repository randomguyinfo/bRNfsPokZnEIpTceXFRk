			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Okay new chapter. Enjoy. lol. I still need three Birthdate for my timeline. As soon as i get them and play with the dates, ill post a list with who got who's b-day.(Since it might be awhile until said charater is born,lol) So far i've gotten some dates that have fit perfectly! Okay thats enough talk. Enjoy the Chapter and Review. Thanks!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">DISCLAIMER: Getting your Master Timeline Updated=GOOD Assuming I own Harry Potter=BAD</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p class="calibre7">"How did the shoot go?" Harry asked as Ginny sat her bag down on the kitchen table.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay I guess. I do get to be the August picture, which is neat. It being my birth month and all."</p><p class="calibre7">"Really?" Harry asked, "Your birthdays in august. Never knew that." They laughed as Ginny playfully swatted him on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre7">"No seriously that's awesome Gin. When do they go on sale?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know." Ginny said peeling a banana. "I didn't ask. Why do you want to know?"<br class="calibre6"/>"Because I want one." He said, not looking up from his paper. "Then it can be august year round in my office" he laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny stepped out of the floo and into her parents living room.<br class="calibre6"/>"Mum, Dad were here!" she called through the house as Harry stepped out behind her.</p><p class="calibre7">"In the kitchen dear," Molly called out. They made their way through the door that connected the two rooms and were immediately hit with the scent of roasted chicken and potatoes.</p><p class="calibre7">"Smells wonderful." Harry said as Molly greeted them from the stove.</p><p class="calibre7">"Thank you Harry. Ginny dear, could you set out the plates?"</p><p class="calibre7">They ate in comfortable conversation before having their evening tea.</p><p class="calibre7">"So have you decided on a date yet?" Molly asked. She had been after them for months to set one.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well actually we were thinking November 18th."</p><p class="calibre7">"Of this year?" Molly eyes widened in surprise. "That's in less than a week!"Molly exclaimed.</p><p class="calibre7">"No, no." Ginny said putting her hands up. "Next year."</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh okay, you nearly gave me a heart-attack." Molly gasped clutching her chest. She sipped her tea a bit. "Why that day dear?</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know it just seems right." Ginny said as she took Harry's hand in her own. They stared at each other for a long moment before there was a loud thud on the table.</p><p class="calibre7">They looked up to see molly opening a rather large book.</p><p class="calibre7">"Here Ginny I got this down for you. It is a wedding planner."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny eyed the large lacy book suspiciously. "Okay..."</p><p class="calibre7">"Now have you decided where you want it?"</p><p class="calibre7">"No." "Yes." They answered simultaneously.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny shot a look at Harry. "I thought we decided to have it here." Harry said confused.</p><p class="calibre7">"No we said that's an option. I'd really like to look around." Ginny said sternly. In all reality, she already knew where she wanted it. When Harry had told her the whole story of the horocrux hunt, he had mentioned a small church by where his parents were buried. She thought it would be just perfect. In addition, she figured maybe, just maybe Harry's parent's lot could be cleaned up. Just enough for the reception.</p><p class="calibre7">On the other side, Harry could not understand why Ginny was being so difficult. Didn't she understand that Molly really wanted the wedding at the burrow? And with the barriers all ready in place against unwanted visitors, it was the most plausible option.</p><p class="calibre7">After that, everything seemed to end in an argument. From whether or not Harry should wear robes or a muggle tux, to whether or not they should invite the Dursley's, them being Harry's only family and all.</p><p class="calibre7">When they got home that night, they both got ready for bed silently. Harry quietly slipped into a pair of night pants, something he had not done since they had become intimate.</p><p class="calibre7">They got in to bed and lay down, not touching.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry," Ginny asked softly. "Are you really that upset?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just grunted in response.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny moved to curl her body around his back. "Come on Harry," she whispered as she dipped her hand below his waistband and found his penis. She slowly rubbed it a few times and was pleased when he stiffened. Apparently, his body was not that upset with her.</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny stop it," Harry said angrily as he jerked her hand out of his pants.<br class="calibre6"/>"Well fine then." Ginny huffed. She turned away and wrapped herself tightly in the blanket. She fell asleep imagining it was Harry's arms around her instead.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny awoke the next morning in a foul mood, Harry had already left for work, and she was sure when he got home things would still be just as distant.</p><p class="calibre7">She really just needed a break. <em class="calibre9">Maybe a good shopping trip will do me some good; I could use some new Quidditch gloves. Maybe Luna is not too busy either.</em> With a renewed demeanor, she headed toward the floo.</p><p class="calibre7">When she arrived home, it was dinnertime, she walked through the door her arms loaded. She had never realized how much of a girl Luna could be. She had been dragged, sometimes almost literally into every store they passed.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry looked up from his plate when she entered the kitchen, her bags already deposited by the front door.<br class="calibre6"/>"Where have you been?" He asked dejectedly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Shopping, with Luna. She says hi by the way," Ginny said as she scooped some of the leftover casserole onto her plate.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh," Harry said into his plate. "Hermione called. She and Ron want to have dinner with us tomorrow, at the Leaky Cauldron. I told her I would check with you and tell her at work tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre7">"That sounds lovely." Ginny said dryly. Great <em class="calibre9">dinner with a cranky Harry, my nosy brother and Hermione, who though I love her, will ultimately try to over analysis everything. Awesome.</em></p><p class="calibre7">They ate dinner in silence and followed the same bedtime routine as the night before.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny strummed her fingers against the aged table in the Leaky Cauldron. She glanced over at Harry; he was leaning back in his chair, slowly sipping a glass of firewhisky. He checked his watch.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm sorry we've been waiting so long," he started "but Hermione did say seven."</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay." She replied quietly. "I just wonder why their late."</p><p class="calibre7">"Another ten minutes and we'll order without them."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny nodded and they sunk into silence again. She did not know how much longer she could take this.</p><p class="calibre7">She had just gone back to strumming when a disheveled Hermione showed up to the table followed by a yawning Ron.</p><p class="calibre7">"Im so sorry," she exclaimed. "I got home and when I went to pick up this one." She jerked her thumb towards Ron. "He was still asleep. Took me forever to wake him. I was about to come by myself." She exaggerated.</p><p class="calibre7">"It's okay," Harry smiled a bit. "But can we order. I'm starving."</p><p class="calibre7">As they ate they talked but Hermione noticed that Harry and Ginny had hardly spoken a word to one another, "is everything okay between you two?" she asked after awhile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Bloody brilliant," Harry said sarcastically as he cut up his food.</p><p class="calibre7">"What happened?" she prodded again, looking at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre7">"Nothing," Ginny said looking down. "Just…wedding stress." She finished taking a small bite.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh, Ron would you come with me to the bar for a moment?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Why?" Ron asked his mouth full of food.</p><p class="calibre7">"Because…" she said stressing her word.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh…" Ron said a bit of food falling from his mouth. "We'll be back." He said as they made their way to the bar.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm guessing they were uncomfortable." Harry said setting down his utensils. "How long are we going to keep this up?" he asked not looking at her.</p><p class="calibre7">"What do you mean?" she asked offended.</p><p class="calibre7">"I mean how long we are going to fight about this. I'm tired of it."</p><p class="calibre7">"What are you suggesting Harry?" Ginny asked a bit afraid of the answer.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't know, but we can't go on fighting." He took a sip of his drink. "I guess we could look at other locations, I just think the Burrow would be easiest."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny smiled, "Harry just because we look doesn't mean we're not having it at the Burrow. It just means were looking." She said grabbing his hand for the first time in days.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled at her. "Okay I'm giving on this but you've got to learn to compromise too." He looked at her seriously.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay." Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry smiled wider. "Come here." He said pulling her onto his lap. He gently kissed her lips. "I love you." He kissed her again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oi you two." Ron said as he and Hermione made their way back into their seats. "People are trying to eat here." Harry kissed Ginny again, and Ron mimicked throwing up. Ginny rested her head on his shoulder and laughed.</p><p class="calibre7">Sent from my iPod</p>
