<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_4">*Chapter 3*: Chapter 3</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">CHAPTER THREE*</p><p class="calibre7">The next morning Harry awoke to the smell of bacon and eggs. He got up out of bed, dressed and headed down the stairs. He stopped when he got to the kitchen and noticed Ginny was sitting with her back to him.</p><p class="calibre7">After giving Ron a cue to be quite Harry slowly snuck up behind hem and put his hands over her eyes and whispered "Guess who" softly into her ear. She smiled and turned around. After a quick kiss Harry sat down to the right of her, across from Ron. He quietly held Ginny's hand under the table as Mrs. Weasley loaded his plate with mounds of bacon, eggs and toast.</p><p class="calibre7">"Tuck in Deary its going to be long day. We have lots to do and must be leaving as soon as possible."</p><p class="calibre7">She turned back to the stove as soon as she saw Harry start eating. He looked around before asking Ron "Where's Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre7">"She went home last night" Ron sighed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh." was all Harry could think to say, The Ministry had located Hermione's parents and restored their memories a few days earlier, they all new it was just a matter of time before Hermione would leave to be with them. He squeezed Ginny's hand beneath the table and felt her softly return it. They finished eating in silence.</p><p class="calibre7">When they had all finished they took turns apparating to Diagon Alley. Ginny's birthday had been two months earlier and she proudly bragged to anyone she could that she had passed her test on the first try.</p><p class="calibre7">The leaky cauldron was full of people going about there business and Harry was happy that nobody had noticed him yet. Maybe he would be able to enjoy a peaceful day of shopping with the Weasley's at long last, but he knew this was unlikely.</p><p class="calibre7">Mrs. Weasley handed each of them a piece of parchment with their supply list on it.</p><p class="calibre7">"After we go to Gringotts we'll split up and regroup around lunch time." she said hurrying them through the crowd</p><p class="calibre7">"Ummâ€¦Gringotts?" Harry asked somewhat taken back, he had forgotten that he would need to visit his vault to get money for supplies and was sure that the goblins would not welcome him back in very easily.</p><p class="calibre7">Mrs. Weasley nodded at him.</p><p class="calibre7">"That could be problematic Mrs. Weasley, see in our mission we sort of had to break onto Gringotts and I don't think that they are too happy with me." He frowned before a sudden thought hit him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mrs. Weasley, do you think you could get some gold out of my vault if I give you my key?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Well, yes dear I don't see a problem with that, why don't you lot wait in Madam Malkin's, we'll get that done first since it will take the most time." Harry handed her his key and she set off for the bank.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry wrapped his arm around Ginny's shoulder and they set off with Ron towards Madam Malkins.</p><p class="calibre7">When they reached the store they sat in the front room talking about nothing in particular until Mrs. Weasley arrived. When she did she had a shocked expression on her face when she arrived. Harry knew it was probably due to the uncomfortable amount of gold that sat in his vault. He couldn't help the blush that covered his face.</p><p class="calibre7">"I didn't know how much you wanted me to get for you, you never said. So I just got what I could fit in the bag." she smiled sweetly. "But the Goblins did say they needed to talk to you personally." A worried look passed over Harry's face. Mrs. Weasley must have caught it because she continued. "Don't worry Dear, they made sure to tell me it wasn't because of the break-in. They have already been compensated by the Ministry for the damage, although they are still waiting on another dragon." She said waving her hands.</p><p class="calibre7">"I told them I'd have you stop by after we got all our shopping finished."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry gave a sigh of relief and He and Molly walked over to where Ron and Ginny were standing.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh aren't they beautiful!" Ginny exclaimed as she looked a set of emerald green robes. "Oh, wow. I didn't expect to see that number." she said as she looked at the price tag and walked away, a shocked and somewhat disappointed look set on her face.</p><p class="calibre7">"Come on Ginny dear, lets get you measured" Molly beckoned from the back of the store.</p><p class="calibre7">As Ginny walked to the platform at the back of the store to get fitted for her robes Harry looked at the green set she had been admiring. They really would look beautiful on her, he looked at the price tag, it really wasn't as much as he'd been expecting. Although 100 galleons was more than he would pay for a pair of everyday robes for himself, he felt that Ginny deserved it.</p><p class="calibre7">After they had all gotten fitted and paid for their new, or in the case of Ron and Ginny new to them, Hogwarts robes Mrs. Weasley began to lead them next door to Flourish &amp; blotts to get their new school books. Harry waited behind to talk to Madam Malkin.</p><p class="calibre7">"Excuse me." He said to the elderly witch, she looked up at him surprised that he was still there.</p><p class="calibre7">"Yes."</p><p class="calibre7">" I was just wondering if you could fit those Emerald green robe over there to the girl that was just in here"</p><p class="calibre7">A smile spread over her face "You mean the redhead you kept staring at?" Harry blushed and she continued. "Why yes of course I can."</p><p class="calibre7">Harry let out a deep breath "Thank you so much, I want it to be surprise."</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay, when I finish with them I'll place them in the bag with your dress robes. Would you like me to wrap them for you?" She inquired.</p><p class="calibre7">"Could you?" Harry asked excitedly. "That would be wonderful." With one last smile he paid the witch and walked over to the book store.</p><p class="calibre7">"I was wondering where you'd gone off to." Ginny asked when he walked over to her. "Here I went ahead and grabbed some of you books for you."</p><p class="calibre7">"Thanks, I appreciate it." He said as he gave her a swift kiss on the cheek and took the books from her.</p><p class="calibre7">After they had finished the rest of there shopping, picked up their newly altered robe's from Madam Malkin's and had double and triple check the supply list, it was time to head back to the Burrow. Just as they were all getting ready to apparate back to the burrow Mrs. Weasley turned abruptly to Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry dear, you were supposed to go to Gringotts!" She said as she put her hands over her mouth. "I nearly forgot, well off you get." she said turning Harry away from the apparation point and towards the bank.</p><p class="calibre7">"Mum," Ginny interjected causing Harry to stop and turn to look back at her. "Do you mind if I stay with Harry?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny, I don't know if that's such a good idea." Mrs. Weasley said uncertainly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I don't mind." Harry said. Ginny looked at him and immediately broke into a wide smile.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well I guess if its okay with you Harry, just be careful and try to hurry back. I'll have dinner done soon."</p><p class="calibre7">Ron shot Harry a look that said <em class="calibre9">don't try anything with my baby sister </em>and Harry had to do all he could to keep from laughing. As they disapperated Ginny turned to Harry and grabbed his hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"I thought we'd never get rid of them." she chuckled "Now what do you have to do at Gringotts?"</p><p class="calibre7">"I have no clue, but I guess we better go find out." He wrapped his arm around her waist and they set off down the alley towards the bank.</p>
