<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_53">*Chapter 52*: Chapter 52</h2>
			<p class="calibre7">Chapter Fifty-Two</p><p class="calibre7">A/N at end. Read, review and enjoy.</p><p class="calibre7">DISCLAIMER: I don't own Harry Potter</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry,"
Ginny nudged at Harry's shoulder.<br class="calibre6"/>"What?" Harry said
sleepily. He looked at his watch, <em class="calibre9">2am, Really woman.</em><br class="calibre6"/>"I'm
hungry."<br class="calibre6"/>"So go get you something to eat." He said rolling
back over.<br class="calibre6"/>"There's nothing in there I want."<br class="calibre6"/>"So what do
you want?" he asked sitting up on his elbows slightly.<br class="calibre6"/>She
thought for a moment, "I don't know."<br class="calibre6"/>Harry groaned and fell
back into his pillow. A few minutes later Ginny nudged him again.<br class="calibre6"/>"Onion soup." she said<br class="calibre6"/>"What?" He asked confused.<br class="calibre6"/>"I
want onion soup."<br class="calibre6"/>Harry groaned as he got up. He grabbed the
first robe his hand meet and made his way downstairs to the floo.<br class="calibre6"/>He
stepped inside just before shouting 'The burrow'.</p><p class="calibre7">He
was thankful when he saw that Molly was still up.<br class="calibre6"/>"Harry what's
wrong?" She asked concerned.<br class="calibre6"/>"Ginny wants onion soup."<br class="calibre6"/>Molly
laughed. "You just sit and I'll fix it to you."</p><p class="calibre7">She
emerged a little later with a bag, to find Harry sleeping on the
couch. She carefully nudged him awake.</p><p class="calibre7">"What
now Gin.?" he asked sleepily.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry
dear, wake up."</p><p class="calibre7">"What?
Oh, sorry Mrs. Weasley."<br class="calibre6"/>She smiled, "I made a big bowl but if
she wants more you know the replenishing spell." Harry was so tired
he did not even feel embarrassed about the comment. "There's also
a loaf of bread." Harry nodded as he took the bag and walked over
to stand in the floo, he stood there for a moment.<br class="calibre6"/>"Why isn't
it working?" he yawned.</p><p class="calibre7">"You have throw the powder
dear."<br class="calibre6"/>"Oh yeah."</p><p class="calibre7">He made his way back and fixed
Ginny a large bowl of the onion soup before carrying it into the
bedroom.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh thank you Harry." Ginny said sweetly as she
took the offered food.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry just groaned before he flopped
back onto the bed.</p><p class="calibre7">He had just fallen back asleep when Ginny
nudged him.</p><p class="calibre7">"What?" he said a bit heatedly.<br class="calibre6"/>"Could
you get me some pumpkin juice?"</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
sat in the living room of her and harry house, Ron and Hermione
across from her and Harry in the kitchen fetching some drinks.</p><p class="calibre7">"So,"
Hermione asked as Harry reentered the room. "Have you though of any
names yet, your going to pop any day now." she ended with a
chuckle.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
looked over to Ginny and nodded.</p><p class="calibre7">She
took a sip of her drink before speaking. "Well they've said it's a
boy so we were thinking," she paused a bit and almost laughed as
Ron leaned in hoping to hear the rest. "James Sirius." she
finished, lifting her glass again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Aww,
thats an okay name, but you should really name him Ronald. All the
cool people are named that."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
spit her drink out as she began laughing. "Oh, gods Ron, thank you.
I've needed a good laugh lately."</p><p class="calibre7">Ron
leaned back into the couch, sulking a bit.</p><p class="calibre7">"If
it helps," Harry started leaning forward on his elbows a bit. "We
did have something to ask you guys."</p><p class="calibre7">Hermione
nodded, pulling Ron out of his slump to listen.</p><p class="calibre7">"We
were wondering," Harry continued. "If you two would be the baby's
Godparents." Harry finished.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh
so I'm not good enough to have him named after me but I'm good enough
to be a Godparent?" Ron asked humorously.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
just laughed. "Thats the way life is isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre7">Ron
nodded in consent. "Yeah, I guess. But of course we'd love to be
the Godparents." he added at the end.</p><p class="calibre7">"Great."
Ginny said sitting up slightly. "Now who is hungry, I'm famished."</p><p class="calibre7">~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
fell into the living room of the Burrow. He look around quickly
before spotting Molly, sitting quietly in the corner knitting another
baby jumper.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry
dear, whats wrong?"</p><p class="calibre7">"Ginny,
labor." he breathed as he bent over to catch his breath.</p><p class="calibre7">"Harry,
breath." Molly stressed as she rubbed his back. He finally
straightened himself.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm
okay, but I've got to get going. She was yelling at the Doctor when I
floo'd here." he smiled a bit before stepping back into the fire
and back out to .</p><p class="calibre7">"What
do you mean you can't give me anything yet?" Harry could hear
Ginny's frustrated yells from down the hall.</p><p class="calibre7">He
entered the room, to find Ginny propped up, her hand on her hips and
starring furiously at the Doctor, off to the side stood the nurse,
with what looked oddly like Ginny's wand in her hand. When she
noticed Harry in the room she slowly made her way over the Harry,
making sure to give Ginny's bed a wide berth.</p><p class="calibre7">"We
had to take her wand." she said shakily. "she tried to hex the
Doctor." Harry nodded, he had no doubt that Ginny would seriously
hex the Doctor, and really if she didn't have her wand on her there
was less of a chance that he himself would get hit.</p><p class="calibre7">"We
can't give it back to her until she's calm, I'm going to turn it into
the storage department for now." the nurse said chancing a glance
at Ginny. "You can come pick it, probably after she delivers."
Harry nodded and the nurse made her way out of the room.</p><p class="calibre7">He
cautiously made his way to Ginny and sat gently on the side of her
bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin,
sweetie calm down." he murmured as he rubbed her back.</p><p class="calibre7">"Calm
down? Calm down? I know you didn't not just tell me that. This is all
your fault anyway." she yelled, pushing his hand away.</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
just starred at her, gob smacked. "My fault, how is this all my
fault?" he asked as calmly as he could.</p><p class="calibre7">"Well
if you could have just kept it in your pants we wouldn't be in this
situation now would we?"</p><p class="calibre7">Harry
stayed silent but starred at her incredulously, he was afraid that if
he spoke he'd say something he would regret later on.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay,
Mrs. Potter, it looks like you far enough to get so medication for
the pain." they Doctor spoke up from the end of the bed, Harry had
completely forgot that he was in the room until that moment.</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny
let out a sigh that sounded an awful lot like 'thank gods' as the
nurse came in with a small bottle of potion. She swallowed the potion
gratefully before turning to lay her head on Harry's leg.</p><p class="calibre7">"oh
so you like me now?" he asked a bit sourly.</p><p class="calibre7">"I'm
sorry," she mumbled. "It just hurts, so so bad. It's like, I
don't know how to explain it, it's just horrible." she buried her
face into his thigh and he began to stroke her hair softly.</p><p class="calibre7">"It'll
be okay Gin. It'll be okay."</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">August
7th 2004</strong></p><p class="calibre7">A
few hours later found Ginny with her leg propped up screaming
furiously once again.</p><p class="calibre7">"Get
it out of me." she yelled at Harry.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin,
there is nothing I can do, you just have to push."</p><p class="calibre7">"Well
I don't want to, I refuse." she said crossing her arms stubbornly.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin,
you have to push or the baby isn't going to come out." Harry said
running a wet cloth across her head.</p><p class="calibre7">"But
Harry, it hurts." she moaned.</p><p class="calibre7">"It'll
be okay just a bit more."</p><p class="calibre7">"Mrs.
Potter," Ginny looked down between her legs at the Doctor. "One
more push and we should be good, okay?" Ginny nodded and braced
herself, tightly grabbing Harry's hand.</p><p class="calibre7">"Okay,
on the count of three." The doctor spoke up again. "One, Two,..."</p><p class="calibre7">Ginny's
mind blanked out as she pushed again, she was so exhausted, and then
all of a sudden a lightened feel over swept her, and the silence in
the room was broken by a high pitched scream. Ginny tired to open her
eyes but found herself to tired. It wasn't until Harry came to her
side softly murmuring 'Ginny' that she found the strength to open
them.</p><p class="calibre7">"Gin,
look." he said softly as he held a small bundle out to her. She
took it cautiously from him.</p><p class="calibre7">"Oh
Harry," she said, feint tears coming to the edge of her eyes.</p><p class="calibre7">"I
know Gin, we've got a baby boy." he said softly as he knelt by the
bed.</p><p class="calibre7">"No."
Ginny said running a finger through the almost brown, ginger locks on
top of the baby's head. "We have a little James Sirius."</p><p class="calibre7">A/N:
I really wanted the birth to be as real as possible with out being
text book style. So I tried to remember my birthing experience. I can
proudly say that I have have told a Army Captain to F*ck off. PS. I
delivered in a Military Hospital. Lol. I had and interesting
experience, just like our favorite redhead.</p>
