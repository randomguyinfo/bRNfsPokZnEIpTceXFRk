			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">23.
Revenge</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Teddy
was finally asleep after deciding that the early hours of the morning
were play time. He'd spent the hour before dawn screaming his head
off and Harry was exhausted. After one of the shortest night's
sleep in history, Harry wandered blearily down to breakfast, sat
heavily at the table and propped his head on his hand. Ginny pushed a
cup of coffee under his nose and sat down next to him, stroking his
hair back from his face as she ate her cornflakes one handed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy
up most of the night?" she asked. Harry nodded; too tired to do
more than inhale the coffee and hope he got a caffeine hit.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
said Molly as she brought a plate of bacon to the table, "I really
would be happy to take care of Teddy for you." Harry tilted his
head to look at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
Mum," he replied, "but I want to do it. He's my … guest and I
guess I just want to take care of him." Molly smiled at him fondly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I'm here if you need me dear," she said, patting him on the hand
with a smile that said she was anticipating being needed and went
back to the eggs still cooking on the stove.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me
too," said Ginny. Harry turned his head to look at her without
lifting it from his hand. "I'd like to help." Harry reached out
his free hand to grab hers and smiled at her. He was about to tell
her that he and Teddy were the luckiest blokes on the planet when
Hermione stalked into the kitchen, Ron on her heels.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bloody
hell, woman-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Language,
Ron!"</p><p class="calibre8">"-
what did you go and do that for? I was just getting comfortable!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
Ron, in case you are not aware, my parents do not know we've grown
accustomed to, er, snuggling in the mornings!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
forgotten I was not aware of that dear," said Molly matter of
factly, from the stove where she was levitating scrambled eggs into a
large serving dish. Hermione blushed heavily. "It's not that I
mind exactly, dear, but you are probably right to keep those sorts of
activities private."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do not want to discuss this with my mother," muttered Ron under his
breath as he slid into the chair next to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
discuss it with me either," Harry mumbled back, contemplating if
the coffee would be worth the effort of lifting it to his lips. He
had just decided it would be when he heard a wail from the living
room where Teddy had been put to sleep in Ron and Ginny's old
cradle. He sighed heavily and put the coffee back on the table. He
was about to get up when Ginny put a hand on his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let
me go to him," she said in a soft but firm tone. Harry was about to
argue with her but she was looking at him with concern etched into
every one of her features. "You need to eat something and then go
back to bed." She pushed a plate in front of him and piled it
haphazardly with bacon and eggs before she darted out the door and
into the living room. Teddy's cries ceased and Harry could hear
Ginny talking softly. He smiled as he ate his bacon and eggs because
he thought he heard her start singing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
Hermione said quietly as he took the last bite of eggs, "do you
have time to open our letters now?" Harry looked up at her in
surprise. She seemed unaccountably nervous and was fidgeting in her
seat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure,"
he replied. "Let's wait for Ginny?" Hermione nodded feverishly
and her eyes darted to the mantelpiece. Harry saw three parchment
envelopes propped between two of the ornaments and smiled slightly as
he heard two sets of footsteps coming down the stairs, treading on
every creaky board.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
morning!" Mr Granger called cheerily. "You have a fabulous ghoul,
Molly!" Ron stared incredulously at him and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
do need to find a place of our own though dear," said Mrs Granger.
"I don't think we belong in a world with ghouls." Harry got the
distinct impression that Mrs Granger did not share her husband's
enthusiasm for magical spectres.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
there's no need to worry about that yet, dear," said Mrs Weasley,
filling their plates. "Let's get this lot sorted for Hogwarts
before we worry about that. Is Percy's room comfortable? I know
it's a bit of a squeeze. Fred and George's room is a bit bigger
of course but …" She trailed off and turned back to the stove.
Harry heard a distinct sniff.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
it's just fine Molly, just fine," said Mrs Granger, getting up
and patting her on the shoulder. "We'd be honoured to stay, if
it's not too much trouble." Molly turned and smiled brightly at
her though her eyes were red.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
as soon as Ginny comes back," Molly said, "we'll open up those
letters, shall we and see what sort of preparations we need to make."
She turned back to cooking the breakfast and the only sounds in the
kitchen were scraping cutlery and the soft sizzling sounds of cooking
bacon.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
was still tired and was debating whether or not to drink his coffee
or go back to bed when Ginny came back in carrying Teddy. She had
obviously searched the bags Harry had brought with him because Teddy
was no longer in the clothes Molly had labelled pyjamas and handed
him last night but something that Ginny obviously considered daywear.
Harry was glad; he could never quite figure out what was what and
more than once he'd had Andromeda and Ginny laughing at his
attempts to choose Teddy's wardrobe.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
good, he's dressed," said Molly briskly as she bustled over to
her daughter brandishing a bottle. "Did you change his nappy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Eventually,
yes," Ginny nodded and took the bottle from her mother before
settling into the small armchair squashed into the corner by the
fireplace. "When Charlie finally got out of the bathroom. I am
definitely having my own bathroom one day. I am over seeing you lot
parading around in towels! Does he really think I want to see <em class="calibre9">him</em>
flexing his freshly showered muscles?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
doubt you are over all of us flexing things," muttered Ron, looking
sideways at Harry, who felt himself blush profusely. Ginny rolled her
eyes at Ron as she concentrated on settling Teddy for a feed, but
there was a smirk on her face and she didn't argue with him.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
propped his head on his hands and watched her as she smiled at Teddy
and began making faces at him. When Teddy reached up a hand to grab
her hair she laughed merrily and Teddy turned his own hair red. Teddy
sucked noisily on the bottle and his fingers played with the ends of
her hair. Ginny looked down at him and stroked his cheek, then played
with his little toes. As Ginny sat with the baby in her arms, Harry
could see a part of his future. It still amazed him that he had one
and that Ginny would be willing to share it with him. He saw himself
in the kitchen, cooking breakfast, while Ginny fed their son. If they
fixed up Grimmauld Place, Ginny could have her own bathroom. The idea
of Ginny in a towel was much more tantalising than Charlie in one. He
watched as Ginny put down the empty bottle and sat Teddy up, rubbing
his back. His eyes drifted downwards and his mind wandered to the way
those curves felt under his hands and the thought of Ginny in a
bathroom. He had to be roused from his daydream by Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi,
stop drooling and open your letter!" he said, waving an envelope
under his nose. Hermione was looking at hers as if it was about to
explode and Ginny's envelope lay on the table next to him, waiting
for her to finish handing Teddy over to her mother and join them.
Harry took the letter from Ron. It was curiously thin. Hermione was
staring at hers and turning it over and over in her hands. Ginny
picked hers up as she slid into her seat and tore it open in one
swift movement, pulling the sheaf of parchment out and smoothing it
onto the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is the last Hogwarts letter I'll ever get," breathed Hermione,
staring at the envelope in her hands. Ron looked at Harry and shook
his head before reaching out and capturing her hands in his.</p><p class="calibre8">"Open
it Hermione," he said softly. "Nothing bad is going to happen and
you've been looking forward to this. Just open it." Hermione
shook her head, still staring at the envelope clutched between them.
Harry was sure that if Ron had not been holding her hands still they
would have been shaking.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't believe it!" exclaimed Ginny suddenly. "There's no
Defence Against the Dark Arts textbook!" This seemed to galvanise
Hermione to action and she ripped open her own letter and pulled the
contents out with haste and a small, glittering missile skittered
across the table and landed in front of Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is ridiculous!" she exclaimed as she scanned her own list. She
hadn't noticed the small, shiny item in front of Harry. He smiled
as he turned it over to reveal a new Head Girl badge.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look!"
he exclaimed, affecting a breathless falsetto and holding the badge
aloft. "I made Head Girl!" Hermione's head whipped up as she
stared at the badge.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh!
Oh!" she squeaked she dropped the letter on the table and covered
her mouth with her hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not sure it suits me," muttered Harry as he held the badge up to
his chest. Hermione made an indistinguishable noise halfway between a
moan and a squawk. Harry grinned at her and held the badge out. She
took it reverently. Ron and Harry exchanged a glance and smiled at
her as she sat, speechless, the badge in her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Congratulations
dear," said Molly. "That's wonderful! Oh you'll do such a
good job! Isn't that wonderful?" She turned to Hermione's
parents who were beaming with pride and got up to hug their daughter.
Ron plucked the badge from her fingers and pinned it to her chest
before buffing it with a table napkin. Blushing, Hermione pushed his
hand away.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
the point?" said Ginny, tossing her Hogwarts letter across the
table to her mother before reaching for the envelope and screwing it
up. "Do they think there's no need for Defence Against the Dark
Arts? It's not like He was the only evil wizard and now there are a
whole bunch of kids out there know who know how to <em class="calibre9">do</em>
Dark Arts!" she said viciously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that certainly does seem odd," murmured Molly as she read the
letter, holding it at arms length to stop Teddy screwing it up. Ginny
threw the envelope at the fireplace and it bounced off the grate with
a clang. Ginny jumped out of her seat and ran to pick it up. She
frantically pawed through the crumpled remains of the envelope to
extract a Prefect badge just as George and Charlie came into the
kitchen. George shook his head slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
sold out, shorty," he said sorrowfully. "Ickle Ginny's a
<em class="calibre9">Prefect</em>."
Molly swooped in to smother Ginny in a hug, little Teddy squawking as
she did so and Mrs Granger plucked him free and handed him to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
my!" exclaimed Molly. "I'm so proud of you dear!" Ginny
smiled at her mother and patted her awkwardly on the back. Charlie
and Arthur, arrived shortly afterwards and took turns hugging Ginny
but she managed to catch Harry's eye.</p><p class="calibre8">"Congratulations,"
he mouthed at her. Ginny grinned at him and Harry wished they were
somewhere else, so that he could congratulate her properly. The
kitchen was a maelstrom of activity and Teddy was demanding Harry's
attention by reaching for his hair and glasses.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll
have to behave now, ickle Ginny," teased George. "I don't think
we can come to that arrangement concerning free Wheezes any more."</p><p class="calibre8">"Aw,
come on George, think of the free publicity!" she laughed. George
lowered his voice and bent his head to hers conspiratorially.</p><p class="calibre8">"Should
we be discussing this in front of the Head Girl?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think she's too busy to listen to our plans," giggled Ginny.
Harry glanced at Hermione. Ron kept trying to shine her Head Girl
badge which was still pinned to her chest and Hermione was bright red
with embarrassment and the effort of keeping his hand away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
it, Ron!" she said eventually, turning away from him. Ron merely
grinned and slipped his arms around her waist, hugging her to him and
nuzzling her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Open
your letter, Harry," said Hermione. Ron looked up interestedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
open it mate," he added. Harry handed Teddy back to Molly and
picked up his envelope, tearing it open.</p><p class="calibre8">The
kitchen gradually fell silent as Harry frowned at the small piece of
parchment in his hand. Professor McGonagall had written him a short
note that said nothing more than she requested his presence as soon
as possible because she had something of import to discuss with him.
Ron reached out and grabbed the envelope, tipping it upside down and
shaking it futilely before peering inside.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
your badge, mate," he asked. Harry shrugged, re-reading the short
missive from Professor McGonagall and frowning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
McGonagall already gave him the Quidditch Captain badge, Ron," said
Hermione impatiently. "So I expect it's up in your room." Ron
shook his head pityingly at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
that one, Hermione," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,
what's wrong?" asked Ginny. He looked up at her before handing
her the letter.</p><p class="calibre8">"McGonagall
wants to see me at her earliest convenience," he said to the room
at large. "I haven't got a Hogwarts letter." The explosion of
noise was immediate and deafening.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
haven't got one?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought you were going back!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
one Harry, called to the Head's office before term even starts!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you mean you haven't got a letter, dear?'</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is just ridiculous! First there is no text for Defence and now
Harry's letter is missing!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you suppose she wants?" said Ginny as she looked up from the
letter. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only
one way to find out," he said, watching Teddy lean his head on
Molly's shoulder and suck his fist.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you want to go today, I can look after Teddy," Ginny said softly.
She turned to Teddy and held her hands out to him. "You want to
spend the day with Auntie Ginny? I'll teach you how to turn your
hair pink like mummy's." The baby gurgled and snuggled into
Ginny's shoulder as she took him from her mother.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
turn my godson's hair pink," said Harry absently as he retrieved
his letter from where Ginny had discarded it on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know!" exclaimed Hermione. "I expect Professor McGonagall didn't
want your letter intercepted. I mean who knows what could have
happened. They'd know your movements then-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,
the war's over," said Ron. "No one cares where Harry goes now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
according to Witch Weekly, mate," said George who had been
collecting the post from Errol at the kitchen window. The ancient
bird fell off the draining board and Charlie shook his head and bent
to retrieve the bird from the floor. "Witch Weekly appears to be
<em class="calibre9">very</em>
interested in where you go and what you do." George was flipping
through a magazine and eventually stopped, staring exaggeratedly at
the page. Charlie, who was peering over his shoulder, let out a
whistle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
very nice smile, Potter," he said grinning. Harry grimaced. "Oh
look Ron, they got your best side!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Me?"
squeaked Ron. "What have they got me for?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Top
ten wizarding heroes of our time," recited George. "Meet the men
who have ensured our safety and security, ushering in a new era of
peace."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
a load of bollocks," muttered Ron mutinously.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
Ron, you're number two," interjected Charlie, grinning. "Ronald
Weasley, handsome, tall and quite possibly the nicest derrière
around."</p><p class="calibre8">"It
does not say that!" Ron reached for the magazine and captured it
easily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
bet it does," muttered Hermione and Ginny giggled. Ron groaned.
Harry took this to mean it did in fact mention Ron's backside.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
come on then, who are the other eight?" Molly asked. Harry shook
his head resignedly as George plucked the magazine from Ron's grasp
and turned the page.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
doesn't Neville look nice," said George with a cheeky grin. "Look
at you three, beating the Minister into fourth place."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yep,
Kingsley's number four," said Charlie. "Very nice things they
have to say about his voice." George turned the page.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wow,
Dad, you made number five!" Molly snatched the magazine from
George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
and look at my Bill," she said, beaming.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
is the whole family in there?" asked Charlie. Molly turned the
page.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
George certainly is," she said with some pride. George reached over
and plucked the magazine from his mother's hands. He looked at the
page for only a moment before he screwed it up and hurled it across
the room and stormed out the back door. There was stunned silence in
the kitchen and then Ron tore out after him and Charlie slowly bent
to pick up the crumpled periodical and smoothed it out on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is a picture of Fred," he said quietly after a moment. Molly sank
heavily into the nearest chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
I call myself their mother," she said. "Not that I am <em class="calibre9">their</em>
mother anymore, I'm just George's mother." She began to cry and
Arthur hurried to her side. Hermione peered at the page.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
it does have George written in rather large letters," she murmured.
"Anyone would have said George automatically." But this did
nothing to stop Molly's tears. Harry could see Ron and George
through the kitchen window. Ron was talking frantically while George
stood rigid and furious, his arms crossed over his chest. As Harry
watched, Ron reached out a hand to George and it was if his touch
made George crumble and Ron gathered his brother into his arms.
Harry's heart ached as he watched Ron hold George, Ron's shaking
shoulders giving away the fact that he too was crying. Things were
supposed to be getting better, the wounds were supposed to be healing
but looking around him Harry felt emotions that were as raw as if the
war had ended only days ago and not months.</p><p class="calibre8">Arthur
held his sobbing wife while his sons stood crying in the garden and
Ginny was sitting at the table staring at the picture of Fred and
absently stroking Teddy on the head while the baby chewed on a
fistful of her T shirt. Harry looked up at Charlie who met his eyes
and shrugged helplessly. Hermione and her parents sat quietly at the
table while Errol twitched feebly on the draining board.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
Harry, are you going to see McGonagall today then?" asked Charlie
quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um,
yeah, I will," Harry answered. "Should find out what she wants, I
s'pose." Charlie nodded, the conversation dying once again. The
only sound in the kitchen was Molly sniffling and Teddy making a sort
of humming noise as he gummed his fist. Charlie began drumming his
fingers nervously on the table and suddenly Ron came through the
kitchen door with a bang.</p><p class="calibre8">"George
is just, er, talking to Fred," he said nervously looking at his
mother. "I'm just getting one of the, um, files from his room and
we're going to the shop; going to reopen tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre8">"All
right Ron," his father said quietly. "We'll see you at tea?"
Ron nodded as he headed out of the room. Molly seemed to perk up as
Ron bounded noisily up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I'd best get started on tea then," she said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum,
we just finished breakfast," Charlie said softly. Molly just looked
at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you really think, young man, that I can't cook all day?" she
asked him pointedly. Charlie smiled sheepishly and Ron returned
brandishing a sheaf of parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
going to Hogwarts today, mate?" he asked Harry, who nodded. "Might
see you at the shop tomorrow?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I'll be there tomorrow," agreed Harry. Ron nodded and headed back
outside and Harry heard the faint sound of two Apparitions.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
just going to um, contact Professor McGonagall," Harry said into
the awkward silence. Arthur nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
don't you use the Floo, Harry," he said. "It will be quicker
than an owl."</p><p class="calibre8">After
arranging to meet Professor McGonagall later that afternoon, Harry
spent the morning lazing around The Burrow with Ginny and Teddy.
Harry had discovered, over the course of the summer, that when he got
restless, Teddy enjoyed going for a walk in the sunshine. Harry and
Ginny took turns carrying him as they wandered aimlessly around the
garden.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wonder why McGonagall didn't send you a
Hogwarts Letter," said Ginny as she and Teddy watched Harry capture
and throw a garden gnome out of the garden. Harry shrugged and held
his hands out to take Teddy. Ginny wrinkled her nose at him. "Wash
your hands first." Harry cast <em class="calibre9">Augaumenti</em>
to cleanse his hands and Teddy laughed at the stream of water,
reaching out to touch it. Harry conjured more water and directed it
so that Teddy could touch it. The baby flapped his hands in the
water, splashing both Ginny and Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
buddy," said Harry wryly, as he wiped his glasses dry on the hem of
his shirt. Teddy only squealed in response. Harry put his glasses
back on and took Teddy from Ginny, blowing a raspberry on his tummy
and immediately regretting it as pudgy fingers grasped the spectacles
and pulled them off his face. After rescuing his glasses and turning
Teddy to face outwards, so that his glasses were inaccessible, Harry
returned to his earlier conversation with Ginny as they strolled into
the orchard.</p><p class="calibre8">"McGonagall
was the one who told me to come back to Hogwarts," said Harry
thoughtfully. "You don't think she's changed her mind do you?"
Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
doubt it, but I don't understand," answered Ginny. "Perhaps
it's like Hermione said, she didn't want the letter intercepted."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
secrets would my Hogwarts letter hold?" asked Harry. "Dear Mr
Potter, welcome back to Hogwarts, which is no secret because Luna put
it all over <em class="calibre9">The
Quibbler</em>.
We'll see you on September the first as you come off the Hogwarts
Express, which is no secret because everyone does that every year. Go
and buy this list of books from the same shops as everybody else so
they are no secret either." Ginny smiled and reached out a hand to
stroke Teddy's cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
asleep," she whispered. Harry looked down at Teddy who had fallen
sideways, his little head resting on Harry's bicep and his arms and
legs dangling forward. He watched as Ginny gently took Teddy from his
arms and cradled him. Teddy stretched slightly in his sleep before
curling into her chest and sighing. The sight of Ginny with a baby
snuggled into her curves did something to his insides that he
couldn't quite identify, but he knew he didn't want to talk about
Professor McGonagall anymore.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
conjured a blanket and spread it out under a shady tree in the
orchard. Ginny put the baby down carefully before settling herself
next to Harry, patting Teddy when he stirred. Harry watched her again
as her hair fell around her face and he reached out to pull it back.
His hand found the back of her neck and with gentle pressure he
pulled her towards him. He watched as her eyes closed but her lips
still found their way unerringly to his. She pushed him backwards,
her small hands splayed across his chest and his own eyes closed as
he pulled her down with him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
about Teddy?" she asked, breaking the kiss. Harry pulled her back
to him, his hands finding her hips and moving her bodily towards him.
"Harry-"</p><p class="calibre8">"He'll
be fine," he insisted, running his hands up her back and urging her
lips back down to his. Ginny twisted away and a frustrated Harry let
his head fall back onto the blanket. His earlier daydream had come
back to him as he held her in his arms and he had been anticipating
quite a bit more activity than that.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know I get all involved and … lost in
you, Harry," Ginny said, blushing only slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you just?" smirked Harry as he snaked an arm out to pull her back
down. She placed a firm hand on his chest, stopping his progress.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
she warned.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
fine. He's sleeping," insisted Harry, propping himself up on one
elbow and reaching for her neck with his lips. "I get lost in you
too you know." His efforts were thwarted as Ginny sat back on her
heels. Harry flopped backwards in frustration.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
we are … otherwise involved, how can we protect Teddy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Protect
him from what, Ginny?" sighed Harry. "He's in the shade, Mum
did a sunscreen charm on him and he has a hat on. He can only roll
onto his tummy, then he gets stuck, so he's not about to roll
away." He propped his head up on one hand and reached out to her
with the other, entwining his fingers with his own.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
someone out there, Harry," Ginny whispered, leaning in close.
"Someone is watching us." Harry heard her but was unable to
resist the opportunity to capture her lips with his own. He gently
caressed her lips and gradually she melted into him. He had just
reached those tantalising curves that had been beckoning him all
morning when she pulled away suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you hear that?" she whispered frantically, checking on Teddy who
was still dozing peacefully on the blanket next to them.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I didn't," Harry groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
heard something!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know you did, Ginny," Harry reassured her. "It's probably some
reporter or a photographer trying to get a story. They know where I
live now. We should get Bill or Dad to ward The Burrow." Ginny
tilted her head to one side.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
probably right," she said, smiling. "Now I do believe we were
just about … here." But Harry kissed her for only a moment before
he pulled away groaning softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
it is a reporter or a photographer, the last thing we want them to
see is … us … doing that," he said, sighing heavily as he
flopped back onto the blanket. Ginny flopped down next to him
melodramatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shall
I never get my way with you, Mr Potter?" she sighed. Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Never
say never, Weasley." He grinned as he turned onto his side to face
her, lowering his voice to a whisper. "In fact I'd say you have a
very good chance of doing exactly what you please with me one of
these days because soon I won't be able to resist you. It's that
simple."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
hold you to that," she answered, giving him a chaste kiss on the
cheek and sitting up. Leaning against the tree trunk she stretched
her legs out in front of her and patted her lap. "Here, a pillow,
you need to catch up on some sleep." Harry crawled over to her and
laid his head in her lap, falling asleep to the gentle rhythm of her
fingers stroking slowly through his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">He
slept for most of the morning and only had time to grab a quick
sandwich before kissing Ginny a hasty goodbye and dashing through the
Floo. He had planned to Apparate, but Flooing straight into
McGonagall's office saved him some time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
afternoon, Mr Potter," said Professor McGonagall briskly as he
stumbled out of the fireplace. Harry saw Kingsley Shacklebolt seated
in a chair by the desk, a steaming cup of tea in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor,"
nodded Harry, "Kingsley." He looked up instinctively at the
portrait of Professor Dumbledore and saw the professor sitting
upright in his chair, his eyes twinkling, as though waiting for the
entertainment to begin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
a seat, Harry," said Professor McGonagall as she indicated a chair
and poured him a cup of tea. Harry perched himself on the edge of a
squashy armchair. The Professor rarely called him Harry and he had
the undeniable feeling that she was warming up to ask him to do
something he was not going to agree to willingly. That Kingsley was
there was also curious, and he wondered why she had not mentioned
that in their conversation earlier that morning.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not sure why I didn't get a Hogwarts letter, Professor," began
Harry. "It's causing a bit of concern at home."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
yes, well …" Professor McGonagall trailed off uncertainly and
took a sip of her tea. "There is something I need to discuss with
you."</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Board of Governors have given their approval for Hogwarts to reopen
on September the first as usual," said Kingsley. "They have,
however, also made some, well recommendations, which we are obliged
to follow. This has made some … aspects of the reopening
difficult."</p><p class="calibre8">"We
don't have a full complement of staff," said Professor
McGonagall. "One of the new provisos from the Board of Governors is
that the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor be an Auror. They
wish to eliminate any doubt that the person taking the post is, shall
we say, trustworthy." Harry just snorted and Professor McGonagall
pursed her lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
am afraid that Mr Malfoy is determined to make things difficult,"
she said, sipping her tea.</p><p class="calibre8">"Malfoy!"
exclaimed Harry in disgust. He turned to Kingsley. "How is it he
can just waltz back onto the Board like that? I thought things would
be different!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Money
talks, Harry," said Kingsley in an even tone that almost disguised
the disgust that was evident on his face. "I have only so much
influence on the Board."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
does the lack of a Defence Against the Dark Arts text book mean that
there is no Defence Professor?" asked Harry and he got the distinct
impression that Professor McGonagall was avoiding his gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
has not been easy to convince an Auror to take the position," said
Kingsley. "Nor to find one who is capable. Dawlish just didn't
seem an … appropriate choice."</p><p class="calibre8">"We
have managed to engage such an Auror, Mr Potter, however he has …
conditions," Professor McGonagall's face and her lapse back into
formal address betrayed the fact that she was not at all pleased with
this arrangement but she obviously had no choice.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
guess the conditions involve me then?" said Harry, annoyed. The war
was over, Voldemort was gone and he still couldn't get one normal
year at Hogwarts. Something had gone wrong and the year hadn't even
started yet!</p><p class="calibre8">"He
refuses to teach the Seventh Years if you attend the class," sighed
Professor McGonagall. "The man is utterly and completely
intimidated."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
if he doesn't teach the Seventh Years – that's not fair!"
Harry exclaimed. "I suppose that he will do it if I'm not in the
class?" Professor McGonagall nodded her head slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"A
fact that I find utterly unacceptable as you will need the NEWT to
commence Auror training," said Professor McGonagall. "Rather than
ask you not to take the subject, Kingsley and I believe we have come
up with a suitable solution." Harry just stared at the Professor.</p><p class="calibre8">"A
solution?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Mr Potter, a solution," she replied crisply. "I am asking you to
supervise the time slot allocated to Seventh Year Defence Against the
Dark Arts." Harry stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
… innovative," he muttered, casting his mind about desperately
for a way to avoid the situation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
so much innovation Mr Potter, as desperation," said Professor
McGonagall. "Those students already know enough to pass their
Defence Against the Dark Arts NEWT. You taught the majority of them
everything they know anyway."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
I'm not an Auror, so I can't," said Harry smugly. Kingsley
solemnly handed him a small leather wallet. Harry took it at flipped
it open. Inside was a gold disc about the size of a Galleon. His name
was inscribed it below the words <em class="calibre9">Provisional
Auror</em>.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Board of Governors might be able to make all sorts of arbitrary
decisions about Hogwarts," said Kingsley gruffly. "But I am able
to make all sorts of arbitrary decisions about the Auror department."</p><p class="calibre8">"Please,
Harry," pleaded Professor McGonagall. "If you don't do this,
you won't be you won't be on the NEWT course and if you're
not on the course, you can't take the exam. Stupid, I know, but
that's the Ministry for you. And quite frankly,
if Harry Potter doesn't take Defence Against the Dark Arts it will
undermine the entire course and we simply can't afford to let the
subject fall off the curriculum." Harry sighed and ran his hand
through his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Besides,
I like potential Auror Department Heads to have a Defence NEWT,"
said Kingsley idly sipping his tea. Harry just stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
am I going to find the time to do this?" he asked after a long
silence broken only by the clink of McGonagall's teaspoon on her
saucer. "I'm going to have enough trouble with my own studies
without doing lessons and things for other people!" Professor
McGonagall looked at him with raised eyebrows.</p><p class="calibre8">"As
I said Mr Potter, these students know enough to pass the NEWT," she
said patiently. "There is very little left to learn, it is all
about the red tape. As I said, they have to take the course to be
able to sit the NEWT. I did not say you had to teach them anything.
Of course, if you should choose to teach, and require assistance, you
do remember Hermione Granger, do you not?" Professor McGonagall
took another sip of her tea and shuffled some paperwork on her desk.
Harry looked up at the portrait of Professor Dumbledore behind her
head. His eyes were still twinkling but he did not speak. Harry
scowled at the portrait and turned to Kingsley.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
if I agree to do this, what … you make me some sort of part time
Auror?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I might have made up a new Auror category," said Kinglsey, not
looking him in the eye. "The Board was very specific that the
Defence Against the Dark Arts supervisor had to be employed by the
Auror Department. They did not exactly specify in what capacity."
Harry looked at the wallet in his hand, turning it over and
inspecting the back.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is already engraved," he said slowly as he rotated it. "Were you
that sure I would agree?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Albus
was," said Kingsley shortly. He looked as though he had just lost a
bet and if Harry looked carefully he could see the ghost of a smile
on Professor McGonagall's lips. Harry sighed as he turned his
attention to Dumbledore who was sitting upright and expectant in his
chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay,
I'll do it," he said. "Just to get us all through the red tape;
I'm not doing any teaching." Professor McGonagall smiled and
Kingsley sighed in relief.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you, Mr Potter," said Professor McGonagall. She fished a parchment
envelope out of the top drawer of her desk. "You might need your
Hogwarts letter." She came around the desk to hand it to him as he
stood. He tucked it into a pocket until he could get home and open it
with Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
see you on September first, Professor," he said. "Would it be all
right if I stopped in to see Hagrid on the way home?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course, Mr Potter," Professor McGonagall replied. "I am sure
Hagrid would be most pleased to see you." Suddenly Harry found
himself engulfed in a hug. It lasted only a moment and the stern
woman he had come to know was back, self-consciously straightening
her robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Off
you go then Potter, I have work to do," she said briskly as she
bustled back to her desk. Harry just smiled as he pushed the heavy
doors open and made his way down to see Hagrid.</p><p class="calibre8">There
was little evidence in the castle that a battle had ever taken place
there. Walls had been repaired, paintings rehung and suits of armour
had been set back in place. Harry toyed with the idea of going up to
the Seventh Floor to see the Common Room but the events of that
morning were too fresh in his mind and he had no desire to go near
the seventh floor corridor where Fred had died. He hurried down to
the Entrance Hall, ignoring the portraits that called out to him and
headed out into the sunshine. Thestrals flew above the Forbidden
Forest and he noticed Hagrid at the edge of the Lake. It looked like
he was fixing a small boat. Fang gambolled around the lawn nearby and
Grawp was watching him intently. Harry called out to Hagrid as he
changed direction but before he'd gone too far Fang had run him
down and was licking his face. Harry, pinned to the ground by the
massive dog, screwed up his face as he tried to fight Fang off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fang!
Back off ye great dozy thing!" bellowed Hagrid. "Sorry Harry!"
Having managed to push Fang off with some difficulty, Harry cleaned
himself off as best he could with some well placed cleaning charms
and made his way to Hagrid who engulfed him in a hug.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello,
Hagrid," wheezed Harry. "Hello Grawp! What're you doing?"
Harry could see now that Hagrid had a pile of little boats and with a
start he realised they were the boats that the First Years came to
Hogwarts on.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fixin'
th' boats up," said Hagrid as he effortlessly flipped one over
and began inspecting it. "Only realised yesterday that the storage
shed got hit by a few stray spells. Professor McGonagall seems a bit
worried that they'll sink. Took pains ter tell me she didn't want
any Firs' Years drownin'. As if I'd let any of 'em drown. I
got long enough arms to fish anyone out." Hagrid shook his head as
he inspected the next boat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
it's probably best, you know, to fix them," said Harry feebly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
all set fer comin' back ter 'Ogwarts then Harry?" asked Hagrid
suddenly. Harry looked up at him in surprise. Hagrid sounded worried.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I only just got my letter, so I have a bit of shopping to do I
expect," he said. "I can't see any problems though." Hagrid
looked at Harry seriously.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
goin' to keep yer nose outta trouble this year aren't yer?" he
asked. "If I find ye in that Forest I'll haul yer inter detention
meself." The large man was looking suspiciously moist eyed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I've never just gone in there on a whim!" protested Harry. "And
you've actually dragged me in there before!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Jus'
you stay out of tha' Forest, Harry," insisted Hagrid. He was
looking distressed and suddenly Harry realised why Hagrid was so
adamant he not go near it. Harry had not considered the impact of
that last terrible battle on Hagrid. He reached up and patted Hagrid
on the elbow.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry Hagrid," he said. "Of course I'll stay out of The Forest.
In fact I'm going to stay out of trouble entirely this year. I'll
be a model student, you'll see. Life will be peaceful and quiet."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don'
go gettin' carried away Harry," said Hagrid. "There's gotta
be some room for mischief." He winked, his solemn mood obviously
forgotten.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I'm sure Ron and George can help me there," Harry smiled. Hagrid
wiped his suspiciously wet eyes and patted Harry on the back so hard
that he toppled into Fang who thought it was a new game. Hagrid had
to haul him out from under the huge dog and Harry looked ruefully at
his bedraggled robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd
best get home and tidy up I 'spect," said Hagrid, his giant hands
clumsily straightening Harry's collar so forcefully Harry thought
he might choke. "Don't need young Ginny seein' yer like tha'."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
see yer at the start of term, Harry," Hagrid finished and Harry bid
him and Grawp goodbye before ambling up to the gates and Apparating
back to The Burrow.</p><p class="calibre8">The
sun was low in the sky and the shadows were lengthening as he pushed
open the kitchen door to find Hermione and Neville sitting around the
kitchen table and Molly bustling around the stove. He'd been at
Hogwarts a while and judging by the smells it was nearing tea time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi
Neville," greeted Harry as he pushed the door shut.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Harry, you're back!" exclaimed Hermione. She still had her Head
Girl Badge pinned to her shirt. And Harry smiled to himself. "What
did Professor McGonagall say? Have you got a letter? Did you ask her
about the Defence text book? How does Hogwarts look? Will it be ready
in time for the start of term? Did you see Hagrid, or Grawp?" Harry
smiled at her enthusiasm.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
tell you, I'll tell you," he said laughing. "Where's Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
took Teddy for a walk," said Hermione. "I really don't
understand why she wouldn't let her mother do it. We were getting
so much done in our little meeting."</p><p class="calibre8">"Meeting?
What meeting?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
dropped by to see Teddy and the Head Girl here managed to rope us
both into an impromptu Prefect meeting," said Neville. Harry tried
to hide a smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you're the other Seventh Year Prefect then?" asked Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
and Gran is ever so proud," said Neville, grimacing slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
fantastic Neville," said Harry dropping into a seat. "I think
Ron'll be pleased. Since he's not going back with us, it should
be you. Who are the others? Do we know?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yes, I have a list," said Hermione fishing through the pile of
parchment in front of her. "I don't know who the Head Boy is. I
thought he'd be on there. I really do think it is remiss of
Professor McGonagall not to let me know. There's a lot of things to
plan and I have less than two weeks. What if I don't like him? What
if we can't get along? I was worried it would be Malfoy, since he
was Head Boy last year, but he's the Slytherin Prefect." She
scanned the list before passing it to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Malfoy's
coming back? And he's a Prefect?" asked Harry in disgust, as he
scanned the list. "That's about as welcome as the fact that his
father's still on the Board!"</p><p class="calibre8">"He
is?" exclaimed Hermione. She shook her head. "I know he stayed
out of Azkaban, but on the Board? How does this world work?" Harry
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kingsley
says money talks," he said bitterly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
saw Kingsley?" Harry was about to answer when a scream ripped
through the air.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny!"
exclaimed Neville as he bolted from his seat. Harry didn't have
time to wonder that Neville could tell so swiftly that it was Ginny
screaming because he reached the door quicker than Neville, Hermione
on his heels and the three of them hurtled out into the late
afternoon sunshine, Molly close behind. Harry could hear Dora barking
frantically in the orchard before the screaming suddenly ceased and
the dog began to whimper. Between the whimpers he could hear Teddy
crying.</p><p class="calibre8">Without
wasting breath shouting Ginny's name Harry ran for the orchard. He
leapt over a low stone fence in his way and skidded around a hedge to
find Ginny on the edge of the orchard, curled protectively around
Teddy as a burst of red spell fire shot out of the shadows, making
her scream again. He couldn't get a clear shot at whoever had the
Cruciatus curse trained on her so he cast the strongest shield charm
he could and hoped that it would interrupt the spell. Or disturb the
intruder, anything really, he wasn't fussy. The spell ceased and
Harry saw a shadow dart through the trees at the edge of the orchard.
Ginny stopped screaming and her mother pushed frantically past Harry.
Harry and Neville took off after the shadow in the trees.</p><p class="calibre8">Their
quarry was not particularly adept at keeping quiet and Neville and
Harry had them cornered within minutes. Coming around a tree, Harry
cast a stunning spell and Neville threw an <em class="calibre9">Expelliarmus</em>
blindly past the tree. A black robed figure fell face down
spectacularly while a wand went spinning through the air, narrowly
missing Neville's head. Both Harry and Neville were panting heavily
as they pushed the offender over with their feet so that they could
see their face. A comatose Gregory Goyle lay at their feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
might've known it was him," spat Neville. "He never could hold
that curse for very long." Harry looked at Neville in horror.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
what?" he croaked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
he's good enough at it I suppose, but Crabbe could hold it longer,"
said Neville sounding suddenly worn out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
enough?" echoed Harry faintly. Neville shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Might
be the most disgusting curse on the planet but you can still be good
at it," he said, kicking Goyle and then levitating him and
directing him through the orchard back to where Ginny was. Harry was
not certain that Neville was trying to miss the trees as Goyle was
hitting them with alarming regularity.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's
heart leapt into his throat when they got back to where they had left
Molly. For a moment he felt guilty for leaving her alone to pursue
Goyle, but this was pushed aside when the logical part of his brain
reassured him that her mother was with her, and she hadn't been
alone. The orchard was considerably busier than when Harry had left
it to dash into the trees. Hermione was crouched over Dora, stroking
the still whimpering Creeler, Mr and Mrs Granger had obviously heard
the commotion and Mrs Granger was soothing Teddy while Charlie was
conversing in low tones with her husband. Ginny was lying still and
unconscious in her mother's arms. Harry heard the distant crack of
several Apparitions as he raced to her side. A loud thump let him
know that Neville cancelled the levitation spell on Goyle rather
suddenly while he was still some way above the ground.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
she – is she all right?" asked Harry quietly as he fell to his
knees beside Ginny. He took one of her hands in his, it was cold.
"Ginny?" She remained unresponsive and Harry blinked back the
tears gathering in his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
breathing," said Molly, her voice wavering. "She probably needs a
Healer." Harry was dimly aware of several more people joining them
as he stroked Ginny's cheek, smoothing the hair off her face and
kissing her forehead gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
happened?" said Arthur as he knelt beside Harry and reached out to
his daughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"G-Goyle,"
said Harry, starting to shiver despite the warm sunshine. Arthur
slipped an arm around his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"Malfoy!"
The quiet was shattered by a shout from Ron. "What are you doing
here, you scum?" Harry jumped at the sound of Ron's voice and
whirled around to see Ron, his wand drawn and pointed menacingly at
Malfoy's chest. George was holding him back. Harry had no
hesitation in joining him and Neville hovered near his elbow. Malfoy
suddenly looked rather intimidated and throwing up his hands, he
began stammering.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
– I was l-looking f-for Goyle. He – he's gone a bit … barmy."</p><p class="calibre8">"Barmy?
What do you mean, barmy?" demanded Harry, his wand ending up only
inches from Malfoy's chest as he advanced on him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I told you he was touched in the head, didn't I?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
yeah, we've known that since first year," said Ron impatiently,
waving his wand about dangerously. Malfoy shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I mean more touched," said Malfoy looking a little more relaxed.
"You're looking a bit barmy yourself there, Weasleby." Ron
growled and flourished his wand near Malfoy's head.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
what are <em class="calibre9">you</em>
doing here? asked Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
told you, I was looking for Goyle," said Malfoy impatiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
here?" asked Harry viciously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not answering any of your questions," scoffed Malfoy. "You can't
detain me like some criminal." Harry, keeping his wand trained on
Malfoy turned his head slightly to check on Ginny and saw that George
and Charlie were standing behind him and Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yes I can," Harry snarled as he watched Ginny's head loll back as
her father pulled her into his arms and her mother conjured a wet
cloth to sponge her face. "But I don't want to deal with you
right now, I have better things to do, so out with it. Now!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on, out with it," repeated Ron menacingly. "Why is Goyle here and
why is he using my sister for target practice?" Malfoy looked at
Ron disdainfully until Harry let out a low growl.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
because of Crabbe," Malfoy sighed. Harry drew his brows together in
confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Crabbe's
dead," he said bluntly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
realise that, Potter. I'm not an idiot," sneered Malfoy. Harry
flourished his wand under Malfoy's nose for good measure. "That's
what sent Goyle barmy. How is this not clear to you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you don't seem barmy," said Neville. "Why's it sent him
'round the twist?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd
better start explaining, Malfoy," Harry spat. "Like I said, I've
got better things to do than talk to you."</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
gone mad with grief. He wants to avenge Crabbe's death," said
Malfoy a trifle sullenly. "He blames you."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
Crabbe started that Fiend Fyre!" Ron yelled. "Harry saved your
sorry ar-behinds!" Malfoy looked at him scathingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Obviously
you don't understand love, Weasleby," he said. "Such a touching
article about your family here and the Mudblood, I thought you would
have understood his motivations." George let Ron's arm go and Ron
had his wand at Malfoy's throat, pushing the Slytherin against a
tree before Harry could move.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
you ever say that again," he hissed menacingly. "You will
apologise to Hermione. Right. Now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry
Granger," squeaked Malfoy, rather pathetically in Harry's
opinion, but it was enough for Ron to let go of his shirt. Harry had
been considering Malfoy's claim while Ron was menacing him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you saying Goyle's trying to get revenge on me, for Crabbe's
death?" he asked Malfoy, who nodded. "So he's doing that by
targeting Ginny? Why?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
the Weaslette is the woman you love," said Malfoy simply, eyeing
Ron's wand which was still dangerously close to his left ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
why not just target me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
have to spell it out for you, don't I?" Malfoy sighed.
"Dumbledore wasn't the only fruit on the Hogwarts tree."</p><p class="calibre8">"Huh,"
said George after a prolonged silence. "Didn't see that one
coming."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
hadn't given much thought to the love lives of his professors and
certainly not to Goyle's. He wasn't surprised by Malfoy's
revelations, just startled that it had been revealed in that way at
this time. He heard Ginny groan from behind him and turned. Arthur
was doing his best to reassure her as he knelt on the ground, her
small body cradled in his arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
all right, Ginny, you'll be all right," Arthur whispered and
Harry wasn't sure if he was trying to convince Ginny or himself.</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy?"
Ginny whispered frantically.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
fine, shhhh," whispered Molly. Something inside Harry just snapped.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't <em class="calibre9">care</em>
if he lost the love of his life!" spat Harry. "There's been
enough! The war is over, it's been ENOUGH! I won't have anyone
hurting anyone else I love! I won't lose anyone else because of
this stupid war! It's over and I've paid a big enough price. I
won't pay anymore!" He advanced on Malfoy and Ron must have seen
either a dangerous glint in Harry's eyes or the fear in Malfoy's
because he grabbed Harry's arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
just call the Aurors, Harry," he said. "Let them deal with it."
Harry felt Neville grab his other arm but he shook them both off and
took a step closer to Malfoy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I don't have to answer any more of your questions," Malfoy's
voice wavered only slightly. "I'm not talking till you call an
Auror."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
don't worry, I'm already here," Harry said, his voice cold,
calm and menacing. He fished in his pocket for the small wallet
Kingsley had given him that afternoon and flipped it open, shoving
the gold disc in Malfoy's face. The other man's jaw dropped.
Harry tossed the wallet to Ron who let out a low whistle. Harry
whirled around to train his wand on Goyle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
hurt him!" shrieked Malfoy suddenly. "He's the only friend I
have left!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry
…" Ginny's voice was barely a whisper but it cut right through
Harry's fear and diffused his simmering anger. He whirled around.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't,
Harry," she said. "It's over, let it be over." With sudden
clarity Harry saw that Malfoy had lost things in the war too. The
Malfoys might have managed to worm their way out of Azkaban. They
might still have money and influence but Draco Malfoy seemed a shadow
of his former self despite his bluster and bravado.</p><p class="calibre8">As
Harry looked around, he was reminded that he was surrounded by those
he knew to be friends and his family. Malfoy said he had only one
friend left. Harry, without effort, could influence anyone from a bus
conductor to the Minister. Malfoy's father sought to retain his
tenuous hold on power and influence by trying to throw his weight
around and draining the family coffers. Harry had to stop a grin
appearing on his face as he realised that if he wanted to, he could
turn all of these things to his advantage. There would be few
repercussions if he damaged Gregory Goyle, but then if he used his
influence to flout the law, was he any better than the Malfoys?</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
glanced at Ginny; she was pale but her eyes pleaded with Harry not to
do anything. They held a mixture of apprehension and surprise.
Instinctively he knew that if he did anything further the
apprehension would translate into fear; fear of him, and the surprise
would be replaced with sorrow. There were some repercussions he
couldn't and didn't want to live with.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
lowered his wand slowly as he held Ginny's gaze. The battles might
be over, the war might be won but there was still a lot of fighting
to do. The kind of fighting that kept the peace. Kingsley was already
starting to change things and Harry was pleased that he was going to
do his part. He was going to start with helping out at Hogwarts and
if he could do something about Lucius Malfoy's influence on the
Board while he was at it, then so much the better.</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone
had better call Kingsley," he said quietly and put his wand in his
back pocket. In a few short strides he was kneeling at Ginny's side
and gathering her into his arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you all right?" he asked, searching her pale face intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy,
is he okay? I tried to shield him," Ginny whispered frantically.
Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
fine, he's okay," he said, pressing a kiss onto her head before
he buried his face in her hair.</p><p class="calibre8">After
several minutes Harry realised vaguely that Arthur had left and Molly
got up slowly muttering something about tea. Whether she meant the
meal or a strong cuppa Harry did not know. She stroked her daughter's
hair before kissing Harry on the head and walking heavily away. That
her parents left Ginny with him right then spoke volumes to Harry and
if he'd had any doubts about their approval they would have been
banished by those simple acts. Ginny clung to his shirt and he
instinctively rubbed her back as he knelt on the grass in the
orchard, the remaining sunlight shining in horizontal beams through
the trees. He ignored the rustling activity he could hear behind him.
It sounded as though Bill and Fleur had arrived because he could hear
the French woman's voice. They stayed silent for several long
minutes before Ginny stirred.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dora?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know," answered Harry. He heard a quiet footsteps swishing
through the grass behind him and then Bill's voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dora's
fine," he said. "Hermione and Ron are taking her to the Magical
Menagerie to be sure."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
croaked Harry. A sudden thought crossed his mind. "Where's
Teddy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Fleur's
taking him home," said Bill. "Don't worry, Harry. It's all
taken care of. Dad summoned Kingsley to deal with those two idiots.
All we need to do is bring Ginny inside. I think Mum wants to check
her over."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't need checking over or <em class="calibre9">bringing</em>,"
huffed Ginny. "I can do it." She futilely struggled to sit up for
a minute before Harry picked her up and sat her in his lap, resting
his forehead on hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
bring you," he said softly. "You can't possibly walk after
that." Ginny looked at him mutinously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
fine," she said grouchily. "It wasn't even a particularly good
Cruciatus." Harry blanched at the casual way she said it.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you mean?" demanded Bill. "How can you tell what a good
Cruciatus is?" Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Crabbe's
were always better than Goyle's, so really, if you had a detention
you kind of hoped for Goyle," she said matter of factly. "His
usually don't do more than tickle. Seamus just used to yell louder
for effect. Those dopey Death Eaters thought Goyle was better at it
than Crabbe, so he always got given the Gryffindor detentions.
Something had Goyle fired up today though. That actually hurt."
Harry just stared at her in horror.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
many of these detentions have you had Ginny?" asked Bill quietly.
Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
we mostly kept our noses clean in class," she said. "Not that
many. Snape sent me to Hagrid most of the time. I only really had
that three week one." Harry remembered the time she had showed him
the photograph, the time Snape had been so angry that he not sent her
to Hagrid.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
how many, Ginny?" asked Bill again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
three weeks is twenty one days, Bill," she answered sarcastically.
"Perhaps you can figure out the maths?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Twenty
one days straight?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Bill," she rolled her eyes. "That is what three weeks usually
means. Look, I don't want to talk about this. Can we just go
inside?" Harry nodded and Bill picked her up from his lap so that
he could stand. It was by silent agreement that Bill handed her back
to his waiting arms. The three of them made their way to the house,
Bill hovering protectively. As they neared the back door Kinglsey
came out with Malfoy. Another Auror trailed after them, levitating a
still unconscious Goyle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where're
you taking them?" asked Bill as they joined Kingsley on the back
steps.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
going to St Mungo's to be assessed," answered Kingsley,
indicating the unconscious Goyle. "Young Mr Malfoy here is coming
in to explain to us why he didn't inform us that Mr Goyle was
stalking Miss Weasley during the last twenty four hours."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
told you someone was watching me," said Ginny triumphantly as the
three of them went inside. She insisted on being put down once inside
and Harry eventually acquiesced and placed her gently on the floor
just inside the living room. She took only one step towards the
couch before sinking gracefully to the floor, her knees hitting the
worn carpet as they gave way. Molly gasped and Harry dropped to his
knees beside her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,"
he said, reaching for her hand. She jerked away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't,"
she whispered in a strangled tone. Harry reached out to her anyway,
putting one hand on her cheek and turning her face to look at him. He
was startled to see the tears glittering in her eyes. She continued,
whispering softly, "I'm okay."</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
you're not," said Harry, stroking his thumb on her cheek. "You
need to see a Healer." Ginny closed her eyes. Harry pulled her to
him and looked over her head at Molly who was wringing her hands and
looking sorrowfully at her daughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
fine," insisted Ginny in a stronger voice. "I just need a bit of
a rest." Neville snorted. Harry hadn't noticed him standing by
the fireplace.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
off it Ginny-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville,"
warned Ginny in a low tone.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
he answered forcefully. "You know as well as I do this is serious.
It took three weeks of detention before that happened last time."
Ginny glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
has happened before?" asked Arthur softly. Ginny looked away and
Neville nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Madam
Pomfrey warned her that this might happen," he said quietly.
"That's why we always covered for her after that, me and Seamus
mostly. Cruciatus usually takes your mind but Crabbe and Goyle didn't
have much finesse and it affected her nerve endings. I got caught
hanging about outside, waiting for her detention to finish after a
week. So I had to wait in the Common Room. When she didn't come
back after the last detention I went looking for her. It was a good
thing she was near the Hospital Wing because it wasn't something I
could fix with a simple healing charm. Don't be stupid, Ginny. You
know a Healer can probably fix it with a potion." Molly knelt in
front of Ginny and reached out to smooth the hair from her face.
Ginny flinched.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
didn't you tell us?" she murmured. Ginny shrugged, studying her
fingernails. Harry could practically feel the embarrassment rolling
off her in waves. "If we knew-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I didn't exactly expect to run into a Cruciatus curse going about
my peaceful daily existence, did I?" she eventually spat. "It's
not something that happens to most people." Harry had a sudden
vision of Ginny trembling in his arms after spell fire had sizzled
over her head in Origin Alley. Battle was one thing but curses coming
at you while going about your daily life were quite another.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
get you to St Mungo's," said Arthur softly and Harry could hear
the pain in his voice. Harry wiped away a single tear that fell down
Ginny's cheek. "We'll Apparate from outside." Harry stood up
wordlessly and gathered Ginny into his arms before following Arthur
and Molly outside.</p>
