<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_18">*Chapter 17*: Chapter 17</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">There's
a Land that I Heard Of</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The
next morning dawned completely differently to the soggy night they
had finally fallen asleep to. Eventually, at three in the morning,
Harry had succumbed to sleep as he listened to the rain slow its
patter on the window and was not too happy initially when woken only
a few hours later by a rather enthusiastic Ginny Weasley who had
hurtled through the door that joined their rooms and thrown herself
on top of him.</p><p class="calibre8">When
he realised it was Ginny and she'd managed to do this action
without waking either of her snoring brothers Harry was a little more
receptive to the idea. He did not hesitate to pull his arms out from
under the covers and wrap them around his lovely girlfriend. She bent
down to kiss him soundly on the lips and Harry fought the urge he had
to flip her over and pin her to the bed so he lay there, trailing his
hands up and down her back leisurely as her lips toyed with his. He
was startled when he heard Ron grunt and pulled away from her
suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
wake George up," he mumbled, stumbling out of bed. Ron headed for
the door Ginny had just come through. Harry craned his neck to watch
fuzzily as Ron approached Hermione's bed and pulling back the
covers, climbed in. Harry slammed his eyes shut and shuddered. He
could feel Ginny giggling.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
guess he got over his fear of her seeing him in nothing but his
pyjama pants," muttered Harry as Ginny shifted slightly so that she
was lying next to Harry instead of straddling him.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
spent some time on that little project," revealed Ginny. "Then
she told me all about their evening by the pond!" Harry chuckled
before sobering a little.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you think they've gone … well … further?" he asked, as if
fearful of the answer. Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
she would have told me. But he has been sneaking into her bed in the
mornings as soon as I leave for the bathroom. I guess they like
snuggling under the covers." At that moment George moved in his bed
and Harry and Ginny froze.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you two can't be quiet, can you get out and let a bloke sleep!"
he said exasperatedly before pulling the covers over his head. Ginny
stifled a giggle and she and Harry lay quietly on Harry's bed.
Ginny was fully dressed and on top of his covers but she was close
enough for Harry to feel her sweet breath on his face and look into
her brown eyes despite the fact his glasses were still on the bedside
table. Ginny smiled as she raised a hand to trace his lips with her
fingers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
Morning," she whispered. "I haven't been able to sleep."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
at all?" Harry asked softly as he kissed her fingertips. Ginny
shook her head frantically and looked at him brightly. Harry wondered
if perhaps she was now running on adrenaline and in desperate need of
sleep. He watched as her eyes slid shut while he stroked her face and
hair, tracing her facial features with one index finger.</p><p class="calibre8">His
stomach began doing strange flip flops as he watched her. When he
moved away slightly Ginny's arm tightened around his torso and she
threw her leg over his. He froze and laid there, his heart beating
rapidly and his stomach flopping around uncomfortably as other parts
of his anatomy woke up. Then George started to snore. Harry groaned.
He was never going to get any sleep this way. As soon as Ginny's
breathing evened out he carefully slid himself out from under her and
wrapped a blanket around her. She snuggled into the indent his head
had made in the pillow and sighed contentedly in her sleep. Grabbing
his glasses, Harry slipped quietly into the adjoining room. Ron poked
his head out from Hermione's covers as the door clicked shut
softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you want, Potter?" he asked grumpily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
that's nice," huffed Harry as he threw himself on what was
obviously Ginny's bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
aren't you in the other room snogging my sister?" demanded Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I never thought I'd hear you say that!" laughed Harry. Hermione
appeared then, glaring at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
are you interrupting us, Harry?" she asked pointedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not interrupting you!" retorted Harry. "You can keep doing
whatever you like! I am going back to sleep." He burrowed under
Ginny's bedclothes, placing his glasses on her bedside table.
Suddenly a pillow came flying at his head. He sat up abruptly, aiming
a detached glare in Ron's general direction.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
was that for?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
are you in here, instead of in with Ginny?" asked Ron. Harry
couldn't decide if Ron was indignant or astounded.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
asleep," Harry muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"So?"
asked Ron as he apparently did something that made Hermione giggle.
"I love snuggling up to Hermione, even when she's asleep. It's
nice." Harry could hear the smile in Ron's voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
great Ron, but do you really want me doing to Ginny what you are
obviously doing to Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
well, probably not," stammered Ron. "But you're a lot nobler
than me. You wouldn't." Harry grunted as he turned his back to
them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you two have a fight, Harry?" asked Hermione suddenly. Harry sighed
loudly and turned over.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
he said exasperatedly, "but I couldn't sleep next to her. I was a
bit too … happy about that. I'm tired and there's no way either
of us could have slept if I stayed in the same room as her. Besides,
George started snoring. Now stop reminding me what I'm missing out
on and let me go to sleep." He heard Ron and Hermione settle back
into her bed and they obviously all drifted off to sleep because the
next thing he knew he was being roughly awoken by someone shaking his
shoulder. He rolled over to see Bill grinning at him widely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny's
a bit miffed with you," he chuckled. "We're going down to
breakfast before we meet Jonathon. Come on, get up!" Harry, having
dressed for the day in Muggle clothing, went downstairs to the dining
room. He paused as he got to the table the Weasleys were sitting at
with Hermione. Whenever they sat to eat Ginny always made sure there
was a seat next to her for him if she got to the table before him.
This morning however she was sitting between George and Fleur and
carefully, meticulously, spreading honey on a crumpet without raising
her head. George looked at Harry apologetically and shrugged. Still
watching Ginny, Harry sank into the chair opposite her and reached
for a glass of juice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Morning,"
he said quietly and everyone at the table murmured back except Ginny.
Harry stared at her, his brows drawn together willing her to look at
him. When she did not he surveyed the rest of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">The
hotel's dining room was full of guests although thankfully Ashley
and her giggly friends were not among them. Mostly the dining room
consisted of elderly witches sipping tea and the odd wizard reading
<em class="calibre9">The Weekend Oracle</em>
which had a headline that read <em class="calibre9">'MUGGLES
MISPLACE FOOTBALL STADIUM: WIZARD'S BUCKS PARTY TO BLAME'</em>.
Hermione was buried behind the same paper and he nudged her with his
foot.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Harry," she replied without looking up, "they think you had a
bucks party." Harry groaned and helped himself to one of Ron's
crumpets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!
Go and get your own breakfast! Buffet's that way!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But
Ron," said Harry cheekily, "you know I like to share things with
you!" Ginny snorted at this comment. Ron gave her a sharp look as
Harry just pushed back his chair and stalked off to the buffet. He
felt irritated that Ginny wouldn't look at him, or apparently talk
to him and irritated that the Australian newspapers were acting like
Rita Skeeter on Muggle speed. He gloomily collected a plate and
surveyed the food on offer.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
don't know what you did, do you?" Bill asked from his left elbow
moments later. Harry shook his head as he moodily dumped some
scrambled eggs on his plate. "You left her to follow Ron and
Hermione." Harry viciously prodded some bacon with the end of some
tongs and grunted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
only went into the next room so she could sleep," he muttered as he
surveyed the twelve varieties of jam for his toast. He blushed
violently as he spoke. "If I'd stayed there I definitely would
have woken her up considering I was having a hard time keeping my
hands to myself. And when George started snoring, well …"</p><p class="calibre8">"She'll
get over it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Will
she? She never acts like this. Normally if I'm being a prat, which
I might add I am not," he said glaring at Bill, "she yells at
me." Bill began heaping his own plate with bacon and eggs. He
seemed to be considering something.</p><p class="calibre8">"George
and Ron told me you had a talk with dad," he said eventually. Harry
nodded with no idea what that had to do with it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dad
reckons I know Ginny really well, but I am completely at a loss
here," Harry admitted. "You'd think she'd appreciate that I
was being considerate." Bill nodded as he contemplated adding both
crumpets and toast to his plate. Harry looked back at their table to
find Ron in an earnest whispered argument with Ginny. He was
gesturing with his hands, occasionally pointing a finger in her face.
Bill, seeing the same thing, nudged Harry over to a nearby table away
from the rest of the family.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
long were you two going out before you broke up before?" Bill asked
as he began eating. Harry toyed with his food.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only
a couple of weeks, not long." Bill nodded, this obviously meant
something to his train of thought but its relevance was lost on
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I'm not sure which it is right now, but maybe you can put her odd
behavior down to one of two things," said Bill. Harry looked up
curiously. "Either she wanted you to … well it's either the
time in her cycle she wants to … or she's moody because she's …
well the opposite. Knowing how much she's like mum I'm afraid
it's the former." Harry merely looked at Bill in confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
have absolutely no idea what you are talking about, Bill," he said
eventually. It was the first time Harry had seen the trademark
Weasley blush on Bill. The man was normally so composed. Bill
hurriedly stuffed his mouth with food. When he swallowed he muttered,
"maybe Fleur should explain this." Harry could only agree. If
Bill was going to be so vague perhaps she should.</p><p class="calibre8">"Or
Hermione," Harry mumbled as he stabbed viciously at the bacon with
his fork. Bill brightened.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course! You've known Hermione for years, you've been best
friends!" he said with what sounded suspiciously like relief. "No
need to explain then, Hermione would have by now." Harry finished
the food on his plate and contemplated Bill thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
good," he said, although nothing really was. "I'll be back in
my room." Harry pushed his seat back and hastily left the dining
room, taking the stairs two at a time and managing to scuttle inside
his room just before Ashley and her giggling entourage saw him as
they exited their own room.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
was more confused than he had ever been in his life. He had no idea
what was going on with Ginny, even less of an idea what Bill had been
talking about and could not think of a single thing that Hermione had
ever said to him that explained the mess he found himself in right
now. He had done the right thing, acted appropriately and yet it
seemed like he'd done the wrong thing. He hadn't been moping on
his bed long before there was a soft knock at the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
in," he said morosely. Hermione pushed the door open and peered
around it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you alright?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yeah, I'm great Hermione," said Harry sarcastically. "The
global wizarding public thinks we're getting married, Ginny isn't
talking to me for reasons I don't even know, let alone understand
and Bill is talking in some sort of code that I can't possibly
decipher. I'm brilliant." Hermoine smiled sympathetically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill
thinks it's so simple," Hermione shook her head. Harry swore she
was shaking it pityingly. "He thinks it can be explained by
hormones and natural cycles but it's more than that." Harry
raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
anyone ever going to clue me in?" he asked exasperatedly. He
recounted what Bill had said in the dining room, confessing he had no
idea at all what Bill had been talking about. Hermione smiled as she
began a long winded explanation of hormones and cycles and mood
swings and why Bill thought that could account for Ginny's
reaction. Harry stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
Bill thinks Ginny might be miffed because I didn't take advantage
of her because right now she's … well …" he trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
fertile," Hermione said briskly. Harry grimaced. "Of course I
don't think it's got anything to do with that at all."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
don't?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I don't," she said smugly. "I think Bill was right with the
first thing he said." Harry thought back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
followed you and Ron?" he asked, puzzled. Hermione nodded
enthusiastically.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
wondering why you elected to go and sleep in the same room as me and
Ron and not stay with her," she said. "Maybe she is wondering if
you don't find her attractive. Why would you get out of a nice warm
bed with her to go and be with us?" Harry stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
you heard me! That's why I left the room! It was too warm and too
nice in bed with her!" Harry groaned, flopping back on his bed as
he clutched at his hair. "Dad said I know Ginny better than I think
I do but honestly I have no idea what she's thinking, why she's
thinking it and right now it's like I never even knew her at all."</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
you talked to her about your physical relationship?" asked Hermione
quietly. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
been so much going on and well, we've not really talked about it,"
Harry shrugged. "What is there to say?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You
should decide how far you are going to go right now, where you are
going to draw the line, what you are comfortable with." Hermione
sank down on the bed next to Harry as he stared at the ceiling. "You
have to talk about this, Harry. She doesn't know where she stands."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
so telling her I want to marry her someday isn't telling her where
she stands?" Harry asked with a touch of sarcasm. Hermione gasped.
"She's my whole world, Hermione. I don't want to mess it up."
He turned to look at Hermione then, fighting an irrational urge to
cry. He blinked furiously before looking back at the ceiling. He felt
the bed move as Hermione rose and went to the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
going to tell her to come and talk to you," she said. "And when
you've finished we'll go out with Jonathon. Take your time, this
is important." A few moments later Hermione opened the door and
shoved Ginny unceremoniously through it before shutting it behind
her. Harry remained where he was, staring at the ceiling with no idea
what to say.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione
said I had to come and talk to you," said Ginny stiffly. Harry
looked up at her, she hadn't moved from the doorway, her arms were
crossed and she had a scowl on her face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
look so thrilled," he muttered sarcastically. The silence that fell
between them was thick and oppressive. Harry had no idea what to say
or if she would even listen to him in her current mood so he elected
to say nothing at all. Eventually he climbed off his bed and went to
sit on the window seat, staring out at the bustling street below. He
pulled his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around them as
he watched a small boy dart in and out of the crowd lining the
streets, a witch, who was probably his mother, following him closely.
He saw street vendors with little carts wandering the middle of the
street, stopping to sell their wares and watched an elderly couple as
they walked hand in hand, peering into shop windows.</p><p class="calibre8">Origin
Alley was uncommonly like Diagon Alley. He couldn't hear it but
somehow Harry knew it was cacophony of sound, the hum of excited
voices, the exchanging of money and the touting of wares. He saw a
group of children with their noses pressed to the window of what was
obviously a broomstick or Quidditch supply shop. The sign flapping
above the door would flip up so he could see the broomstick on it
occasionally. Opposite, he could see a wandmaker who'd been trading
since 1790 and a store labeled 'Ledgers and Labels' that was
probably a book or stationery store judging by the display in the
window. He couldn't see any teenagers and surmised that they were
in school. Maybe they were preparing for a day in the local village.
Just like in Diagon Alley an immense white building rose up at one
end of the street. He watched as people, miniaturised by distance,
hurried up and down its steps. He idly wondered if the Australian
branch of Gringotts was open on a Saturday and did not hear Ginny
approach.</p><p class="calibre8">By
the time his eyes had travelled to investigate a building that was
obviously a post office, judging by the birds swooping in and out of
it, he could sense her standing near him. He squinted to try and make
out what sort of bird Australian wizards used for their mail and
could see her out of the corner of his eye. He still had no idea what
to say to her but looked up at her anyway and all his frustration
melted away. For a single moment he saw the scared little girl he'd
rescued in the Chamber and he felt, somehow, his twelve year old self
reaching out to her. The feeling only lasted a moment and then he was
himself again and his eighteen year old hands wiped the silent tears
from her cheeks and pulled her into his lap. They sat silently on the
window seat for several minutes, Ginny buried her face in his shirt
and he stroked her hair trying to think of nothing, watching the
people mill about on the street below.</p><p class="calibre8">Eventually
Ginny raised her tear-stained face to his and Harry didn't fight
the irresistible urge to drop a kiss on her nose. He summoned a box
of tissues from his bedside table and handed it to her, watching as
she wiped her tears away and blew her nose. He said nothing. He still
had absolutely no idea what to say. He wanted to make this better,
make it go away and get back the girl he knew and loved but he
realised that this was a part of her too so he waited patiently for
her to tell him what was on her mind.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is stupid," she eventually muttered. "I cry too much."</p><p class="calibre8">"We've
been through a lot," Harry offered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
never used to cry this much."</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
not, but you never used to be recovering from a war, did you?"
Ginny looked at him then.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
that was two months ago!" she exclaimed. "You're safe, you're
here, we're on holidays. What's there to cry about? I don't
even understand myself. How can I expect you to understand."</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell
me about it," said Harry sincerely. "Maybe we can figure it out
together." Ginny sat in contemplative silence for the longest time.
Harry watched her. He watched the curve of her eyelashes as they
blinked open and closed. He watched how her chest rose and fell as
she breathed. He watched as her tongue darted out to wet her lips and
how her teeth chewed on her lips as she thought.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
felt like you chose them over me," she eventually whispered. "Why
did you go and sleep in there? Why didn't you stay with me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't want to wake you up," replied Harry softly. "You were so
tired and when you fell asleep you looked so peaceful. If I stayed
there too long I would have woken you up. I couldn't sleep with my
heart hammering in my chest … and … well … and then George
started snoring." Harry grimaced as he finished.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you didn't go because you didn't want to be with me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
Harry whispered, "I went because I wanted to be with you too much.
My body does strange things around you Ginny Weasley." Ginny
blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
I woke up alone I thought you'd gone down to breakfast or were in
the shower," mused Ginny. She looked at him. "I went back into my
room and the three of you were curled up in there and I just felt so
lonely. Ron was all snuggled up with Hermione and I didn't know why
you didn't want to snuggle up with me. Didn't you want me?"
Harry stroked her hair tenderly as he tucked a stray hair behind her
ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
love snuggling up with you. I love you. I do want you. But I'm
still getting used to these feelings and me losing control on a lumpy
mattress in some drab hotel room while your brother snores three feet
away and you are sleep deprived is not something either of us need to
experience," admitted Harry softly. "At the right time, at the
right place I am going to make you my wife and then we can go to some
really fabulous hotel and I'll lose control, I promise." He
smiled and Ginny giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you really want to wait until you are married, for … you know?"
asked Ginny shyly. Harry gazed at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">We
</em>are married," he said simply. "I
want you, only you. I want it to be special. I don't think we're
ready for sex yet. We've only really been together a couple of
months and we're still figuring each other out or we wouldn't
have had this silly fight. I don't want to rush into anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum
said to me, that once you start it's hard to stop," Ginny
blushed. "I think she was telling me if I start … now it'll be
really hard at school where there are not many … opportunities for
that sort of activity. I didn't know you have that sort of
reaction. I didn't know you feel that … strongly. I wasn't
expecting … well, <em class="calibre9">that</em>
this morning though. I just wanted to be near you and I felt sort of
… abandoned when you left."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can say sex, Ginny," Harry grinned at her. "Although if you can't
look at me and say it then we definitely shouldn't be doing it."
He laughed and Ginny slapped him on the arm. He pulled her to him and
kissed her lightly before resting his cheek on her hair and gazing
out of the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dad
reckons if you aren't ready to get married you aren't ready to …
well, you know," he murmured. Ginny laughed softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you can't say sex, Harry …" she trailed off, shifting so she
too could see out of the window and watch the people in the street
below.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
love you," said Harry eventually. "If I do something that bothers
you, tell me. Don't make me guess. Talk to me, okay?" He looked
into her eyes, pleading with her to understand. He saw the girl he
knew, the one who understood him so perfectly, looking back at him
and he realised that he understood her just a little bit more now.
She leaned forward and gave him a soft kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry," she whispered. "I didn't handle it very well, did I?"
Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
can't all be perfect," he said with a grin. "D'you reckon
Jonathon is here yet? Let's go down and see!" He jumped up,
picking Ginny up as he did so and she squealed. Harry twirled with
her in his arms, her hair flying and she laughed delightfully.
Impulsively he leant down to press a kiss to her lips and they
stopped twirling. He felt Ginny's hands sneak into his hair and he
pressed his own to her back, losing himself in her scent and the feel
of her hands on his scalp.</p><p class="calibre8">A
soft knock on the door broke them apart but Harry kept his arms
around her waist as Bill poked his head around the door hesitantly.
He smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
guys ready to go? Jonathon's here and if we don't give him and
George something to occupy their time we could be in trouble," he
grinned. "They've already set fire to four paintings, two rubbish
bins and a pot plant."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
just grab a coat," said Ginny and she kissed Harry on the cheek and
skipped off to her own room to grab the article of clothing. Harry
picked up his own discarded coat from the bag at the foot of his bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"All
right, Harry?" asked Bill with a smile. Harry nodded. He was all
right.</p><p class="calibre8">"Strewth, you two took ya time!" was
Jonathon's greeting as Harry and Ginny followed Bill down the
stairs, hand in hand. Harry did not miss the pleased look that
crossed Ron's face as he caught sight of Harry and Ginny's linked
hands. Smiling secretly to himself Harry leaned over and pressed a
kiss to Ginny's hair, watching Ron out of the corner of his eye as
he did so. Ron smiled softly, unaware that Harry was watching him.
Molly was right, Ron did have a look about him when he watched Harry
with Ginny. Pulling Ginny into his arms Harry stood in the hotel
foyer barely listening to Jonathon outline where they were going. It
didn't matter where he was going, it only mattered who he was with.</p><p class="calibre8">************************</p><p class="calibre8">Jonathon
dragged them to all the regular tourist spots that Muggles liked to
frequent. Eager to capture their holiday, Hermione had them pose in
front of more than one iconic Sydney landmark while she or Jonathon
snapped picture after picture with her camera. Harry dutifully posed
with the rest of them but in reality paid very little attention to
where they were and what they were doing for most of the day. He
spent his time watching Ginny, making every attempt not to let go of
her at any time. After talking to her that morning he simply felt
closer to her. He realised that he'd spent the last two months
expecting Ginny to listen to him as he told her meagre details about
what he'd been up to last year and was, in comparison, verbose
about his feelings since fighting Voldemort. Rarely had he listened
to her talk about how she was feeling. It wasn't that he didn't
care or that he stopped her talking but only now did he fully
appreciate that she wasn't volunteering information and unlike her,
he had not asked.</p><p class="calibre8">No
wonder she had acted so uncharacteristically this morning. Perhaps if
he'd had an idea how she felt he would have acted differently and
the whole mess could have been avoided. As he watched her pose for
photographs with Hermione and Fleur, dressed as Chinese princesses in
the Chinese Garden of Friendship, Harry wondered what Ginny felt. He
knew she loved him, she told him constantly, showed him constantly,
but what was she feeling? Was she as in love with him as he was with
her? Had he asked her what she wanted or just told her what he
planned to do? She hadn't been complaining but as the weak sunlight
filtered into the pavilion they were in and lit up Ginny's face as
she laughed, Harry realised that all the plans he'd dreamed were
meaningless unless she made them with him. Harry told her she was
beautiful when she twirled in front of him in an oriental green silk
dress and decided some time alone was in order, resolving to spend
some with her soon.</p><p class="calibre8">A
short time later Harry watched, leaning against a pillar, as Bill and
Ginny sat, talking, in a pavilion that looked out over the water.
Fleur was reading out information from her guide book that only
Hermione was listening to as Jonathon and George subtly bewitched
twigs to race between plant life on the calm water. Ron approached
him, sitting down on the low fence that surrounded the pavilion, his
long legs sprawling into the middle of the pavillion.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
you sorted things out with Ginny this morning," he said. Harry
nodded, feeling that was obvious given that they had probably been
more nauseatingly affectionate than Ron and Hermione since leaving
the hotel. Harry and Ron both seemed to have found that being on a
holiday seemed to increase how carefree they felt and correspondingly
the amount they showed affection. Harry had been amused to see Ron
playing with Hermione's hair and kissing her neck as they walked
along the street. In contrast to sixth year, or perhaps because of
it, Ron was usually a lot more reserved with his affections in
public. Harry found himself pulling Ginny close as they walked
along, tucking his hand into her back pocket and more than once he'd
caused a delay because he'd pulled Ginny into a kiss in the middle
of a footpath.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did you say to her?" Harry asked Ron eventually.</p><p class="calibre8">"Told
her off," Ron said succinctly. "Honestly, what a stupid thing to
go mental over. You were being a gentleman. That book really came in
handy, hey?" He nudged Harry with one elbow and winked. Harry
didn't have the heart to tell him he'd barely made a dent in
reading the book Ron had given him for his birthday last year. Harry
also did not tell his best mate that he had imagined it said quite
different things than merely how to be a gentleman – given Ron's
own behavior with Hermione. Instead he sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
only a book could tell me everything."</p><p class="calibre8">"Like
what?" demanded Ron. "She's totally yours. Always has been. You
might have the odd fight but what do you need a book to tell you?
You're more noble and gallant than Galahad. She's going nowhere
mate." Harry looked at him seriously then.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
that enough?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
that enough?" insisted Harry. "It's a bit … complacent to
assume anything isn't it? You don't just 'have' someone.
Don't you have to win their heart or something." He shrugged. Ron
just looked at him blankly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
you won her heart years ago!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
had a crush on me, Ron!" Harry's voice rose and he saw Ginny turn
to look at him. He smiled weakly and she beamed back. Clearly she
hadn't heard what he said. He lowered his voice and whispered
furiously. "When did I win her heart, really? Have I?" Ron smiled
at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
won her heart. She's in love with you. She'd marry you tomorrow
if you asked her," said Ron. "Likely follow you to the ends of
the earth as well. Come to think of it, she just did." Ron chuckled
as he looked up into the clear blue sky, the white clouds scudding
across it like tiny missiles.</p><p class="calibre8">"Would
she?" asked Harry skeptically. "Marry me, I mean." Ron sobered.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you
want to get married?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
right now," Harry said softly, turning to gaze into the water. "I
feel like I've got a million things to catch up on. We're both at
school anyway!" Harry watched the lily pads that were floating on
the water in front of the pavilion.</p><p class="calibre8">The
garden was an oasis in the middle of the bustling Muggle city. There
was a busy road just outside one wall and yet, when they'd walked
close to that wall Harry had heard the cars only faintly. It was like
a world apart where only serenity existed. The lily pads below did
not have many flowers. Harry thought that was odd because Fleur had
read out that they were in the Water Pavilion of Lotus Fragrance, so
where were the lotus flowers? He surmised that the flowers simply
weren't in season or they'd not appeared yet. He listened
absently as Fleur continued her discourse from the guidebook, not
really taking in what she was saying but letting her soft peaceful
voice wash over him as it mingled with the ebb and flow of the garden
which seemed to have a palpable peace. Despite his inner turmoil he
reveled in the tranquility of the garden it was soothing and it
seemed to smooth over his ruffled feelings.</p><p class="calibre8">"…
so Harry should definitely get one of those!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
be daft! He should get a Horntail!"</p><p class="calibre8">"We
were gunna get one once, not a Horntail, maybe a Hippogriff, but we
didn't get around to it before …" George trailed off as Harry
turned around to see what the conversation was all about. Ginny was
peering at the guidebook in Fleur's hands and Ron was watching as
George turned away. Harry could see George blink rapidly. Thinking to
give George some privacy to compose himself Harry went over to Ginny
and slipped his arms around her waist. Resting his chin on her
shoulder he asked,</p><p class="calibre8">"What
should I definitely get?"</p><p class="calibre8">"A
lotus flower tattoo!" said Ginny. Harry pulled a face and looked at
Ron who mouthed 'mental' back at him and Harry tried hard to
conceal a chuckle.</p><p class="calibre8">"No!
It's a great idea," Ginny persisted. "Fleur, read it out
again." Clearing her throat, Fleur read from the small book in her
hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"As
ze lotus flower grows up from ze mud at ze bottom and rises above to
display an object of beauty, so people also grow and change into
something more beautiful. Ze symbol of ze lotus flower represents ze
'hard time in life zat 'as been overcome. Ze tattoo of ze lotus
flower ees popular for people who 'ave gone through ze 'ard time
and 'ave come out of eet," Fleur paused and looked up at Harry as
if judging his reaction. Harry smiled faintly and squeezed Ginny
lightly but said nothing.</p><p class="calibre8">"A
flower tattoo?" Ron asked incredulously. "I still think that's
mental. He's a <em class="calibre9">man</em>,
flower tattoos are for<em class="calibre9"> girls</em>.
Now Fleur, she could get away with a flower tattoo!" Fleur snorted
indelicately.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do not 'ave a<em class="calibre9"> flower</em>
tattoo, Ronald," she said disdainfully, "I 'ave a Welsh Green,
right about 'ere." She waved her hand in the vague direction of
her left breast and Ron gulped and the tips of his ears went red.
Ginny burst into uncontrollable giggles and Bill grinned broadly as
if a particularly nice memory was currently scrolling through his
brain. Harry just stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"
he blurted before he could stop himself. Fleur just nodded. She
seemed strangely reluctant to explain further but Bill cleared his
throat suddenly and nodded at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell
him," he said softly. Fleur looked between Bill and Harry
nervously. Ginny's giggles subsided and she went quiet, watching
her sister-in-law intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Viktor,
'e 'as ze Chinese Fireball. Eet iz over 'is heart," she
stopped uncomfortably for a few seconds before hurrying on. "We
went to ze tattooist togezer, before we went 'ome after ze
Tournament. Eet was … to pay ze tribute to Cedric." The group was
silent, George had swung back around and Jonathon was watching them
in confusion and interest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
didn't you take Harry?" demanded Ron suddenly, forcefully. Harry
said nothing but clung to Ginny as if she was holding him upright as
familiar bands of grief gripped him. Fleur looked apologetic and
shrugged one shoulder delicately.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
could not. 'E was not of age," she explained softly. Harry smiled
at her and the bands of grief encircling his chest seemed to ease a
little.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
a shame I can't see it," he said as he winked, making Fleur blush
delicately. They stood there in silence, remembering for a moment
before Jonathon cleared his throat hesitantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
Cedric, sounds like he, er was," here he paused, "a friend of
yours?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
he was," said Harry, "one of the first casualties of the Second
War."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sounds
like he was a real mate," said Jonathon, nodding his head at Fleur.
"I got a tattoo when I came of age." Jonathon rolled up his pant
leg and pushed down his sock. There, fluttering around his ankle was
a tattoo of a pixie.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know it looks kind of daft but that's what me mum always called us,
her pair of naughty little pixies. She didn't even know what real
pixies were, being a Muggle. We got a right laugh out of it when
Professor Fletcher introduced 'em in second year," he rolled his
pant leg back down and stared out over the water. "We were only
sixteen. Not all that little anymore, not really but she still called
us that. We never meant no harm – just high spirits, y'know?"
There was a lengthy pause before Jonathon continued.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
went to a Thunderer-Warrior game; playing for a spot in the finals.
Some idiots near the boundary decided to throw things at the
Warrior's Keeper. He didn't sort of take that too well. He flew
at the crowd and the Thunderer Chasers started scoring up a storm
with the goals unmanned," Jonathon had a faraway look on his face
and his eyes were beginning to sparkle with unshed tears. "The
brawl in the stands was magnificent but it went pretty much downhill
from there. Both the teams started brawling and even though it's
been against the rules, International standards be damned, for
Warriors and Thunderers to bring wands onto the field since the
Catastrophe of 1889, someone obviously had one.</p><p class="calibre8">"Blew
the stands apart. They reckoned afterwards it was a stray bludgeoning
spell. David fell about fifty feet. We were up pretty high. Me older
brother managed to grab me but David … fell," Jonathon let a lone
tear escape down his cheek. It was startling. He had been nothing but
jovial and cheerful the short time they had known him. "We woulda
been seventeen in three more weeks. Hardest thing I ever did was go
back for seventh year without me twin brother. So I went and got me
pixie tattoo before I went, so I could sorta take him with me. Been
nearly six years and I still miss him." George made a strangled
noise in his throat as Jonathon swiped at his cheek with the back of
his hand. He looked up to see the rest of them, eyes riveted on
George and he swung to look at him.</p><p class="calibre8">George
started to tremble and Ron finally broke out of the stupor they were
all in and dashed over to his older brother, catching him just as
George began to crumple to the ground. Jonathon, alarmed, looked back
to the others. Harry saw Hermione swallow heavily. She was watching
Ron hold George as he cried silently.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not supposed to still hurt," wailed George suddenly, startling them
all. Ginny pulled herself free of Harry's arms and flew to George,
wrapping her arms around him as her own silent tears coursed down her
cheeks. The three youngest Weasleys sank to the stone floor of the
pavilion and Jonathon, confused, turned to Hermione, his eyes begging
for an explanation. It was Bill who offered one. Pulling out his
Muggle wallet he flipped it open and handed it to Jonathon. Inside
was a picture of his family on his wedding day, he and Fleur standing
together in the middle, his parents either side of them and his
siblings, except Percy, gathered around. There, next to Mr Weasley
stood both Fred and George making silly faces at the camera.
Jonathon's eyes went wide and he looked up in shock as Bill,
pointing at the twins, quietly spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred
… he – he was killed two months ago."</p><p class="calibre8">"In
the war?" Jonathon whispered and Harry nodded. Jonathon swore.
"Strewth, if I haven't gone and put me foot in it again! I've
got a knack for ear bashin' youse about just the wrong things."
Jonathon shook his head at himself.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
weren't to know," said Hermione, watching Ron and George.
Watching Ron take care of George, it seemed as though Ron was the
older brother and George the younger. Ron had one arm around George's
shoulders as he handed him a handkerchief with the other. Ginny was
kneeling next to them her hand on George's knee and George himself
had his head on Ron's shoulder. Harry saw Ron whisper something to
George who sat up and Ron suddenly looked older, more mature, like
the man he was now. George laughed weakly and Ginny smiled. Ron rose
to his feet and then helped George up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,"
muttered George as he turned to Jonathon who shook his head fiercely.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
don't be sorry. I'm sorry …. I didn't know."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't tell you … can't know," George shrugged. "I'm
fine." Jonathon shook his head at that, sorrow etched on his
features as he looked George's tear stained face.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
will be," the Australian said. "It doesn't hurt this bad
forever. Something missing still, but it doesn't hurt so bad
anymore." Harry felt a rush of affection for their new friend. None
of them, as hard as they had tried, had been, or ever would be able,
to talk to George like this, to reassure him and comfort him. Another
tear leaked from George's eye and dripped slowly down his face as
he looked at Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
like … he's still here and then I turn around and … he's not.
I keep trying to talk to him and he's … not there," said George
brokenly. While Harry and the others had sensed all of this, it was
the first time any of them had heard George say it out loud. His
voice was filled with anguish and heartbreak. "I just miss him …
so much." Jonathon took a step towards George.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know," he said simply. "I know. It gets easier, I promise."
George suddenly looked so vulnerable, standing there and a cold wind
whipped up out of nowhere, gusting through the pavilion and making
them all shiver. George wrapped his arms around himself and nodded
absently and the group stood there in silence for some minutes.
Jonathon hesitantly cleared his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Say,
do any of you like Quidditch?" he asked. Hermione burst out
laughing and Harry grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do believe I am the only one of us who hasn't played it," said
Hermione. "This lot're nutters for it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,"
Jonathon said slowly, "the thing is that after the accident the AQL
– that's the Quidditch League – gave us a family box. Me
brother and me don't really make an entire family so it's never
been full but there's a Warriors game on tonight. If you wanna
come?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
we want to watch Quidditch?" asked Ron, grinning. "You're
asking Weasleys if they want to watch Quidditch? Let's go!"</p><p class="calibre8">The
Wollongong Warriors were playing the Newcastle Narguns, Australia's
all female team. To get to the Quidditch pitch, located in a remote
section of the National Parks surrounding Newscastle, north of
Sydney, the group travelled by a uniquely Australian form of travel;
Flidging.</p><p class="calibre8">It
was quite simple, even logical, when it was explained. When wizards
had first come to Australia they brought with them the English
customs, including those of jumping into fireplaces when travelling.
This proved ultimately untenable on the hot continent and most
wizards began to fly everywhere, creating a lot of trouble for the
Magical Law Enforcement Squad. Being seen by Muggles became a very
big problem and the smuggling of banned flying carpets had been an
issue during the nineteenth century. Witches and wizards were most
active during the winter months when lighting fires and travelling
through them was not such a trial. Many Central Australian wizarding
communities experienced high degrees of isolation because of the
length of time during which Floo travel was untenable. When Muggles
introduced electricity and Australians generally stopped having
fireplaces altogether, wizarding homes began to look quite odd with
their chimneys, smoking at odd times of the year. Wizarding genius,
(according to Jonathon) Billy Madigan, had devised an ingenious way
of concealing the Floo and making it comfortable at the same time.</p><p class="calibre8">Most
wizarding homes and businesses boasted, in one corner of the kitchen,
a large, white chest. Wreathed in magic, these chests were charmed to
be rather large cold cupboards resembling Muggle refrigerators. If a
Muggle happened upon one they thought they were looking at a fridge
but when a wizard opened one it was concealing a fireplace. Not only
did the cooling charms on the chest fool Muggles into thinking they
had opened a fridge, but they made Floo travel a lot more comfortable
given you departed and arrived at an icy location. Billy, the genius
(Ron muttered to Harry that he doubted Billy's genius, just between
the two of them) had diverted all the wizarding flues to local Muggle
power stations and other industrial outlets and it blended with
Muggle emissions so that smoke didn't waft out of thin air - or
houses that were already deemed strange, on days where the
temperature hit a Century.</p><p class="calibre8">The
actual Floo travel wasn't that much different and not all
establishments had a Flidge but it was largely the way it was done so
local colloquialism (and Billy Madigan) had named it Flidging whether
there was a Flidge present or not. It was the preferred method of
travel for short distances only. Some of the larger distances
involved were unworkable. There were simply too many vast stretches
of deserted country to connect the Flidges to each other. It kept
Ernie and his Roobus in business.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me
mum thinks it's a complete porkie pie when I tell her we travel
through the fridges," said Jonathon as he handed the pot of Flidge
powder around. "Course they're not really fridges are they, but
she don't really get that either. Good woman my mum, but not real
into the whole wizard thing. Now you all know where we're going?
Wollemi Quidditch Pitch." And Jonathon vanished in a flash of green
flames. One by one the others followed him, emerging into a long,
narrow corridor where dozens of wizards and witches were emerging
from rows of Flidges.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
good work being a Flidge maintenance officer," mused Jonathon
watching a portly wizard in navy blue robes wave a wand at a nearby
Flidge in frustration. "I mean, he don't look like he's having
a good time, but he's never out of work, is he?" Indeed it looked
as though maintaining the long line of Flidges in this corridor alone
could take a considerable amount of time.</p><p class="calibre8">"There
is an awful lot of er, Flidges," agreed Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only
way to get all the barrackers here on time," said Jonathon as he
led them towards a rickety looking flight of stairs that led up to a
rather lopsided little door. "They messed about with broom travel
first but you gotta hide that from the Muggles and the prescribed
routes were getting blocked and then the broom parking when everybody
arrived, nightmare it was. This might be the greatest area of
wilderness in these parts but we just can't charm an area big
enough to conceal the pitch and the broom holding areas.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
too rugged to run a train line in. Ernie was gunna run the Roobus in
at one stage but he nearly dropped it to the bottom of a gorge.
Apparating in works okay if you're licensed but most people just
Flidge in now." They had reached the top of the stairs and Jonathon
pushed open the little lopsided door. They filed in to the little
room as gasped when they saw glittering pitch beyond the open box
they were now standing in. It wasn't as big as the Quidditch World
Cup but it was impressive all the same.</p><p class="calibre8">The
box they were in was decorated with a plush red carpet and a series
of mismatched armchairs. The six goal hoops stood at either end of
the pitch, glittering in the light that seemed to come from a
thousand lanterns strung up around the edges of the pitch. A large
billboard dominated one side of the pitch and it currently scrolled
advertisements for local businesses. A number of agile looking
wizards flew brooms from box to box offering refreshments from chests
perched precariously on the back of their broomsticks. Whenever one
turned to extract a delicacy from the box Harry thought they would
fall off and plunge to the earth below but they were obviously well
practiced at what they did.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cor,
you Aussies take your sport seriously," marveled Ron as he gazed
into the pitch. George, Harry and Ginny joined him, hanging over the
edge of the box, drinking in the atmosphere of the game. The pitch
was filled with miniature armies of dancing mascots putting on a pre
game show for the crowd and music was pumping from an unseen source.
Jonathon laughed as he came up behind them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Muggles
and wizards alike, sport's a religion around here, mate!" said
Jonathon as he beckoned one of the broom-riding refreshment wizards
over. "The most worshipped in the land are sportsmen, even if they
get themselves into trouble with the law – Oh, eight pies mate -
Muggles are particularly bad at idolising the biggest mugs out there!
We've had our share of course. Was Blue Terrigan who caused a big
ruckus when the dopey galah thought he'd give Muggle drugs a try.
<em class="calibre9">The Oracle</em>
had a field day when he managed to con some dealer into giving him
the wrong sort. Opening season game for the Brisbane Boomerangs and
the silly plonker goes and falls off his broom! Lifetime ban Blue's
got now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Here
why would anyone call their kid Blue?" asked George. "That barman
called me Blue as well come to think of it." Jonathon laughed as he
collected the meat pies from the refreshment wizard.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
the hair mate," he chortled. He only received seven blank looks in
return. "Universal nickname for all redheads."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that's just stupid," muttered Ron as he took the offered pie.
"Where're the peas?" Jonathon handed him a red bottle.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
peas here mate, just the dead horse," he said. Ron looked at him,
revolted, as Jonathon burst out laughing. "Ah, I love trying out
this Aussie slang on you lot. It's priceless." He wiped a tear
from his eye that had leaked during his rather insane moment of
hilarity. "It's only tomato sauce." Jonathon continued to
chuckle as they sank into the various armchairs and waited patiently
for the game to begin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now,
what you gotta remember is that the Narguns are the first and only
all female team in the League and that none of the other teams have
any female players on them at all," Jonathon told them. "They're
a pretty new team, only about five years I reckon and they've got
good backing and extra Ministry grants – which is a political
minefield really – but they can't catch a trick. The blokes all
play dirty on 'em. But the Warriors are down three players tonight.
The Thunderers caused major injury to two in the last game and the
third got himself a four match ban for trying to referee by way of
his fists. So they are playing with reserve players. The bookies
reckon this is the best odds the Narguns've ever had."</p><p class="calibre8">"How
come there's only seven female players in the entire League?"
demanded Ginny. "Do they think women can't play or are they just
a bunch of sexist pigs?" Ron, Harry and George shrank away from
her, looking at her blazing eyes warily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,"
began Jonathon as he took a step back, "I honestly, really, don't
know. It wasn't sort of my decision. But er, well I definitely
think there should be more female Quidditch players. I mean they're
good to watch-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
they are very talented players," interrupted George hastily. "Here
Ginny, have a chocolate." George dug deep into the pockets of his
jacket, offering her a half wrapped piece of Honeydukes, complete
with pocket fluff. Ginny eyed both the chocolate and George
disdainfully and turned her back on them, suddenly intently
interested in the advert currently scrolling across the billboard for
<em class="calibre9">Superior Sporting Supplies - where you
can get all your Quidditch needs – trading since 1857 at number
twenty four Origin Alley</em>. "I've
always suspected sexist piggery at work in the League," Jonathon
whispered to George as he eyed Ginny carefully. "But I'm not
about to admit that to her right now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Very
wise."</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
arched an eyebrow at Harry and tilted his head in Ginny's
direction. Her back was ramrod straight and her arms crossed angrily
over her chest. A distant roar from the crowd heralded the arrival of
the Warriors and Harry watched them flying triumphantly around the
pitch as Ginny's back stiffened even more. The Warriors were either
both naturally burly and arrogant-looking or they had an inflated
sense of confidence at the prospect of facing what was obviously the
League's weakest team. They looked menacing and many had leering
grins on their faces as they watched the Narguns enter the playing
arena. Ginny shifted slightly and Harry could see her eyes,
glittering with barely suppressed fire, as she watched the opposing
team swirl breathtakingly around the pitch. The fourteen players on
the pitch flew into position to start the match and the referee
brought out the balls, ready to begin. Ginny suddenly swung around.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
that any man in my life would think I couldn't play," she said, a
challenge clearly evident in her tone. Her brothers all shook their
heads vigourously and Harry smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
nothing you couldn't do Ginny," he said and winked at her. Ginny
blushed and her posture softened slightly. "You're already a
brilliant Quidditch player and any professional team would be lucky
to have you." Ron rolled his eyes at him but Harry just grinned at
Ron from behind Ginny who had jumped into Harry's lap and thrown
her arms around his neck. Harry slid his arms around her waist and
pressed a kiss to her cheek before whispering that they were going to
miss the start of the game.</p><p class="calibre8">Soon
they were hanging over the edge of the box, cheering on the Narguns
as the all female team threw themselves into the match. It was a
brutal game and more than once Harry found himself wincing as a
Bludger connected with a player or a broom went spiraling to the
ground before its rider could correct the descent. Ron and Ginny
began a heated discussion about the Warrior's Chasers and their
attacking formation and George soon interjected that the Nargun's
Beaters needed to disrupt it more – they couldn't rely on the
Keeper entirely to block shots.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
ze Beater, zey are to hit ze Seeker, not ze Chasers," insisted
Fleur.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ha!
Like George ever sent a Bludger at a Seeker!" Ginny harrumphed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
most of the time me and Fred were too busy sending them away from
Harry!" protested George. "Direction wasn't really something we
paid attention to when saving him from certain death!" It did not
escape Harry's notice that for the first time George had mentioned
Fred without stumbling over his name or seeming visibly distressed.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
isn't the Keeper's job to block the shots? Why should they rely
on Beaters to disrupt the Chaser line up?" asked Bill. "That's
just lazy Keeping."</p><p class="calibre8">"Different
ways of playing I guess," muttered Ron as he studied the technique
of the Warrior's Keeper. There was a collective gasp around the
stadium and Ginny groaned as the Nargun's Keeper clipped the middle
goal hoop and flew out of control halfway across the pitch letting
three goals through before getting back into position. It brought the
score to 220 – 80 in favour of the Warriors. The Newcastle Narguns
were being slaughtered and Harry searched the pitch for the little
golden winged ball as the Weasley siblings continued to debate the
benefits and merits of different playing styles.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
saw the Snitch seconds before the Warrior's Seeker spotted it and
went swooping after it. His robes flew out behind him as he executed
a magnificent dive that took him across the pitch and the path of the
Nargun Chasers, sending two of them spinning unchecked to the earth
as they tried to evade the opposing Seeker. Harry's eyes were on
the Snitch as it zipped across the pitch, glinting in the lamplight,
and he did not see the brawl that broke out behind the play between
one of the Nargun's Beaters and two of the Warrior's Chasers. The
Beater had the advantage, although her use of her Beater's bat was
brutal and likely illegal.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's
eyes were riveted on the Snitch as the Nargun's Seeker, a slight
woman with dark hair that streamed behind her, swooped down, past the
Warrior's goalposts and straight to the earth before leveling out
and shooting up, directly under the Snitch to snatch it out from
under the overconfident Warrior's nose. The crowd erupted as the
Warrior's Seeker, dazed, flew directly into the side of the stands
and his broom handle wedged there, suspending him twenty feet above
the ground, dangling ridiculously from the tail of his broomstick.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah!"
yelled Ron, pumping his fist in the air. "Take that you sexist
pigs!" The rest of the box watched, amused as Hermione threw
herself at Ron and caught his lips in a searing kiss. Ginny giggled
bashfully and Bill grinned while George rolled his eyes dramatically
and taking Hermione's jacket which she had discarded on the back of
her chair, threw it over their heads, effectively blocking them from
his view. Ron and Hermione carried on regardless and Harry swore he
could see Ron's hands move into a rather compromising position
under the jacket and he shuddered and looked away, back out to the
pitch where the Nargun's Seeker was circling the pitch
victoriously, holding the tiny struggling ball aloft.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't wait to play Quidditch," said Ginny softly as she watched
the winning team celebrate. "I've really missed it. I really do
want to try out for professional Quidditch, you know. I wasn't
joking or trying to get one over Ron when Oliver suggested it." She
looked Harry in the eye as if daring him to say anything.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know, Ginny," he said honestly. "I didn't think you were
joking. I really do think you'd be fabulous at it, I wasn't just
saying that." Ginny studied him intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
weren't?" she asked. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you think I was?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
– No … I don't know," she confessed. "Part of me wondered
if you were humouring me. You talk about getting married and that's
not really going to be possible if I'm off playing Quidditch."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
not?" demanded Harry, softly but decisively. "Who made the rule
that you can't be married and play Quidditch too?" George and
Jonathon were busy ribbing Ron and Hermione for their earlier display
and Bill and Fleur were sitting closely, whispering to each other.
Harry and Ginny were effectively alone. Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
just, you know, when you settle down and get married you have to make
a home and stuff," she chewed on a fingernail nervously. "Blokes
want to come home to a nice tidy, cozy house and all that, don't
they? Baking and cooking and scrubbed floors, that doesn't happen
if their wife is off playing Quidditch."</p><p class="calibre8">"Marriage
isn't keeping house, Ginny. It's making a home, a family," said
Harry. Ginny looked at him in surprise as he continued. "Clean
houses and baking don't make happy families. I don't want to get
married because I get a housekeeper out of it – I don't even know
if you can do that!" He grinned and Ginny playfully slapped his
arm. "I already know how to do all that for myself. I want to marry
you, when we're both ready, because I love you and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you. If I have to do all the cooking and the
cleaning while you play Quidditch, well you'd better buy me some
cook books – I'm only really good at breakfast … of course, I
do have a house elf …" Ginny laughed before sobering slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think I'm ready for marriage yet," she whispered. "I've
been worried every time you brought it up because I don't want to
settle down and cook and clean straight out of school. I thought
that's what you wanted." Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
just want you to be happy," he said softly, running a hand through
his hair. "I didn't mean to make you feel pressured. I'm
sorry." Ginny caught his hand and lowered it, tucking it around her
waist. Harry pulled her towards him as she reached up and slid her
arms around his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay," she said so only he could hear. "I want to marry you too,
one day, not too far away, but not yet. Can you wait, you know, until
I sort myself out?" Harry smiled and nodded, lowering his face to
hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,
I will wait for you forever, if that's how long it takes," he
breathed as he claimed her lips in a kiss that she deepened
immediately. Harry's other hand slid around her shoulders and ran
down her back to her hips. He lost himself in her embrace and the
feel of her body pressed against his and the way her curves felt
under his hands as he ran them up and down her body. His arms
tightened instinctively and he lifted her up ever so slightly as his
tongue caressed hers while her hands caressed his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">Neither
of them noticed or cared when George threw Hermione's jacket over
them and they continued kissing heatedly until Ron rather pointedly
tapped him on the shoulder because it was time to leave. Harry
Flidged back to the hotel with a broad smile on his face the whole
way.</p>
