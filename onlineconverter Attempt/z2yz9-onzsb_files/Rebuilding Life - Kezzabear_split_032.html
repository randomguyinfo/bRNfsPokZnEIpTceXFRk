<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_33">*Chapter 32*: Chapter 32</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">32.
Future Fortune</strong></p><p class="calibre8">They were Muggle
photographs. Old black and white studio shots on stiff cardstock,
flimsy, faded snapshots and Polaroids filled with cheesy smiles and
silly faces. Harry tentatively reached out a hand and picked up a
photograph of a cherubic baby who smiled statically at the camera. It
was the baby in the photo at Aunt Petunia's. It was Lily.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is my mum,"
whispered Harry. Ginny peered at the photo in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've got her
eyes," she said softly. Harry smiled softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," he
whispered, gazing at the picture.</p><p class="calibre8">"They must have
had a family photo session," commented Ginny, shuffling through the
pictures and pulling out two more stiff photos. One was a copy of the
picture Harry had seen at Aunt Petunia's and one had those same two
little girls seated on the laps of a sweet looking plump woman and a
thin, angular man who was grinning from ear to ear. His eyes matched
those of his daughter perched carefully on his lap. Harry felt his
eyes grow wet as he reached out to trace the man's features.</p><p class="calibre8">"These must be my
grandparents," he said. "I have my grandfather's eyes."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," Ginny
said tentatively after a moment. Harry sniffed and wiped his eyes
hastily before he looked up at Ginny and gave her half a smile.
"Didn't – didn't you know that before?" Harry shook his
head absently as he laid the group of photographs next to him on the
bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"They died before
I was born," he said, picking up a small snapshot of a laughing
toddler. "I never met them."</p><p class="calibre8">"But in their
photos," Ginny persisted anxiously. Harry turned the photo over and
read the inscription scrawled on the back in smudged lead pencil
<em class="calibre9">'ily, 12 mos fi'</em>.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I wasn't
allowed to look at the photo albums," he said almost carelessly.
"Hey, look, maybe these were her first steps." He showed the
photo to Ginny, his eyes sparkling half with unshed tears and half
with excitement.</p><p class="calibre8">"Never?" was all
Ginny replied, gazing at him sadly. Harry reached out a hand to
caress her face. He shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"They were too
precious and none of my business," he said softly. "Unless I had
to dust them. I don't think I even knew what they were for a long
time. Dudley was looking at one once and I saw enough to realise they
had photos in them but …" Harry shrugged as he trailed off and
returned his attention to the photographs from the envelope.</p><p class="calibre8">He pulled photograph
after photograph from the pile, tracing the features of the chubby
baby, smiling toddler and slender child that would become his mother.
In some shots she played with her sister and in a few she lay cradled
in her mother's arms or hoisted onto her father's shoulders.
There were only about twenty and only a couple were of a child older
than eleven. As he shuffled through the pictures Harry found a bright
splash of colour. It was a Polaroid of Lily sitting in front of a
gaily decorated Christmas tree, her hair tied back from her face.
Next to her was a young man with impossibly messy dark hair wearing
spectacles.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look, it's my
mum and dad," he whispered. "They must have been about
seventeen."</p><p class="calibre8">"They look so
happy," said Ginny a little wistfully. Harry looked carefully at
the photograph. Harry looked carefully at the photograph. He didn't
recognise the place it had been taken. The couch behind his parents
had a garish floral pattern on it that he could never imagine Aunt
Petunia perched on. Lily and James were sitting on a Chudley Canon
Orange shag pile rug strewn with crumpled wrapping paper. The flash
had reflected off his father's glasses and he could see his
parents' hands entwined and resting on his mother's knee. It was
there he saw it; a tiny sparkle on his mother's left hand. There
was a little box in his father's other hand. He glanced back up at
the impossibly wide grins on both their faces and he turned to Ginny
excitedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think this is
their engagement photograph," he said. "Look." Ginny inspected
the photograph and smiled softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He must have
asked her at Christmas," Harry mused. "They look so young."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sirius said they
got married pretty much straight away," Ginny said, looking
thoughtful. "Do you think they were still in Hogwarts here? Home
for Christmas?" Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"At my mum's
house I think, the photograph is Muggle," he answered. He turned it
over. "There's no date on the back, no writing." Harry frowned
slightly. He shrugged and looked at the photograph once more before
carefully shuffling them all together.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wonder where
their wedding pictures are," Ginny murmured.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know,"
said Harry. "I've got one but I think it used to belong to
Remus."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, Harry, I'm
sorry," Ginny said and her hand flew to her mouth. "I – I
didn't think." Harry stopped filing the photographs back into the
parchment envelope long enough to lay one hand gently on her knee.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay,"
he said, "really." Ginny reached out a hand to stop him putting
the photograph in front of the Christmas tree back in the envelope.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wait," she said
as she got her wand out. She riffled through her pockets and
extracted a bent quill. Concentrating very hard, she muttered a quick
incantation transfiguring it into a photo frame and slipped the
picture inside. She then turned and moved aside the Potions text book
and several quills to place the picture on Harry's nightstand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,"
said Harry softly as he felt tears gather in the corners of his eyes
again. He then let Ginny kiss them away as they took their time
saying goodnight.</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">The week passed
slowly. Harry had more free time while Ginny and Hermione were in
Astronomy; although Hermione encouraged him to do some research and
handed him several thick tomes about werewolves, Harry somehow ended
up down at Hagrid's place playing with Dora. Harry came back to the
castle covered in muddy paw prints; the books lay untouched in the
common room. Hermione frowned at him and Ginny giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">Professor
Thistlewaite had not appeared noticeably more comfortable around
Harry and by the second lesson of the week Harry decided to sit at
the very back because it was clear no one would learn anything if the
Professor kept transfiguring tableware into commemorative Harry
Potter plates. Harry was sure that Seamus had started doing it to
every plate Harry used in the Great Hall but had been unable to catch
him in the act. Harry spent the week eating off his own face and
glaring at Seamus who always smiled back serenely.</p><p class="calibre8">Double Muggle
Studies had degenerated into a Monopoly game no one wanted to stop
playing. Draco Malfoy had proved surprisingly good at it and Harry
had never seen anything quite as unexpected as Neville Longbottom
cheering when Malfoy cleaned Dean out entirely. Most of the classes
had been uneventful and life became a pattern of attending classes,
completing homework and snogging Ginny while on patrol to catch
errant students out of bed. Hermione had rolled her eyes when Harry
changed her perfectly organised patrol schedule to ensure he
partnered Ginny, but Harry suspected she'd rostered him with Dennis
and Ginny with Neville deliberately just to see if he would change it
because he caught her smirking as she rolled it up and stowed it in
her bag after the Prefect's meeting.</p><p class="calibre8">By the time Friday
came around Harry was growing bored and restless. He was itching to
do something … exciting. At the morning break, after he'd spent
more time than he cared to smiling stiffly at a fawning Slughorn and
an excruciatingly polite Malfoy, Harry pulled Ginny aside.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm going to
see if I can go visit Ron," he said. Ginny scowled at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's coming
tomorrow," she protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I'll be
back tonight," said Harry, taken aback by her uncharacteristic
sullenness.</p><p class="calibre8">"But you can't
wait until tomorrow," Ginny muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought I might
go and see Lavender," Harry explained quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you don't
need my permission," snapped Ginny, crossing her arms across her
chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wasn't asking
for it," Harry pointed out snidely, confused and more than a little
put out by her attitude. Ginny said nothing more and stalked away.
Harry stomped down to Hagrid feeling more than a little out-of-sorts
and was annoyed to find that Hagrid didn't seem to care. It was
almost as if he was distracted by something.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't get
it," Harry said as they reached the gates. "She's never been so
possessive of my time."</p><p class="calibre8">"All right Harry,"
Hagrid said, glancing backwards and pushing Harry out of the gate so
hard that he stumbled in the roadway, "let us know when ye're
comin' back. I best get back to me … er, I'd best be getting
back anyhow." Hagrid had turned and lumbered back to his hut as
fast as he could. Harry shook his head. He wasn't sure he wanted to
know and he turned and Disapparated, still disgruntled at Ginny and
irritated that Hagrid didn't seem to care.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry probably
pushed the door to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes open harder than was
strictly necessary and stomped inside a little louder than was
warranted. Ron looked up and scowled at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's up your
nose?" he asked. Harry threw himself into the chair behind the
counter and just grunted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah," said
George suddenly appearing out of thin air, "women." He nodded
sagely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop doing that,"
whined Ron. "Do you <em class="calibre9">have</em> to Apparate everywhere just because
you can?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Little brother,"
said George serenely. "You appear to be emulating our dear mother."</p><p class="calibre8">"Where have you
been anyway, you git?" Ron grumbled. "You've been gone for days
and not even an Owl!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhh, not now,
Ronald," said George. "Harrikins looks a little stressed." Ron
made a rude gesture behind George as his older brother turned to
Harry and put a finger thoughtfully on his chin. He stood there for a
while, his head tilted to the side watching Harry who began to squirm
under his intense gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Harry
asked uncomfortably, when he could stand it no longer.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, nothing,
nothing," said George airily as he turned to straighten some
already straight shelves in an extremely exaggerated manner. There
was silence for a moment while George tidied shelves that were
already as neat as a pin and Ron dusted the window display that
wasn't dusty.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sighed
heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't <em class="calibre9">do</em>
anything," he said plaintively. George chuckled and Ron snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, seriously,"
said Ron, leaning on the counter. "What did you do?" Harry
crossed his arms over his chest and glared at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing," he
said, "why are you assuming it was me? I didn't do anything!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe that's
the problem," muttered George with a smirk. Harry gave him a
withering stare.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny got stroppy
because …" he trailed off and sighed. "I have no idea."
George shook his head sagely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Best not to try
and figure it out," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not this week,"
added Ron. Harry shook his head resignedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I have no idea
what you are on about," he grumbled. George leaned towards him with
an unholy gleam in his eye.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe she <em class="calibre9">wants</em>
you to do something," he suggested in such a lecherous manner that
Harry recoiled reflexively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ewwwww, George!"
hissed Ron. "This is Ginny we're talking about!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah and my
Galleons are on before Christmas," George deadpanned. "This is
protecting my investment."</p><p class="calibre8">"She needed
chocolate this week anyway," said Ron. George frowned before his
face cleared and he nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"What has
chocolate got to do with anything?" asked Harry, exasperated.</p><p class="calibre8">"You have no idea,
do you?" asked George pityingly. He clapped a hand on Harry's
shoulder and leaned in close. He lowered his voice to a
conspiratorial whisper. "Chocolate becomes a necessity; no indeed,
it becomes a lifesaver during the time a witch experiences … mood
swings," he explained.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mood swings?"
repeated Harry. George nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Chocolate tames
the savage beast within," he intoned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Never, ever say
that to them," Ron interjected, "ever."</p><p class="calibre8">"You did give her
chocolate, didn't you?" asked George urgently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, if you
count chocolate frogs," snickered Ron. George stared at Harry
aghast.</p><p class="calibre8">"Next month you
<em class="calibre9">need</em> to do better than that," he said. "I recommend some
of Honeyduke's finest, fashioned into handmade balls and filled
with the tantalising taste of summer berries and caramel."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh and that's
your weapon of choice, is it?" snorted Ron. George shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred swore by
them," he said. Ron just gave George a funny look.</p><p class="calibre8">"Next month?"
Harry questioned, the phrase tumbling through his mind, tickling at
his conscience. He furrowed his brow trying to capture the ideas that
were flitting in and out and teasing him as if to say he wasn't
quite good enough to know the secret.</p><p class="calibre8">"To satisfy the
monthly visitor," Ron said at last. He shuddered and looked as
though Aunt Muriel had just decided to visit - permanently.
"Demanding beast." Harry gaped at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's what the
chocolate was for?" he asked weakly. Ron nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"And that means
you've got about a week to hone the rest of your skills," mused
George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Would you stop
encouraging him!" Ron shouted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh come on!
Someone has to protect his interests," said George. "Ginny's
got three other brothers to defend her honour. I'm on his side!
You're his best mate, you should be too!" Ron snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay, I don't
need to talk about this with you two!" Harry shuddered and stood
up. "Now, I thought I might go and see Lavender."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I hope you
have better luck than Bill," said Ron, suddenly sober. "He went
to talk to her and he reckons she sort of took one look at him and
dived into the Floo."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, but <em class="calibre9">he's</em>
Harry Potter," said George cheekily. Harry gave him a withering
look as he strode towards the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I guess we'll
find out," Harry muttered grasping the door handle and yanking it
open.</p><p class="calibre8">"If it doesn't
work," called George, "we'll take her some of Honeyduke's
finest handmade balls of chocolate filled with the tantalising taste
of summer berries and caramel."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry strode over
and pushed open the door to Parvati and Lavender's shop and was
overwhelmed with the heady scents of tea and incense. Parvati was
sitting on a large ottoman in the middle of the store, a crystal ball
sat on a small lace draped table in front of her and she was peering
into it while Lavender sat on the other side in an overstuffed pink
armchair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you sure
that's what you can see?" Lavender said anxiously. Parvati
nodded. "There's no wolves in it?" Parvati sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," she said,
"there are no wolves."</p><p class="calibre8">"There are,"
muttered Lavender looking into the small fireplace that was belching
alternate red and purple flames. "There are wolves in my future I
just know it."</p><p class="calibre8">"None of the
Divination methods we have tried in the last three months have ever
indicated wolves," said Parvati impatiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, maybe
you're not doing them right," snapped Lavender. She drew her legs
up to her chest and to Harry she looked very small and frail curled
up in the large, overstuffed armchair. She was thin and pale and her
hair hung lankly about her face. Her eyes were dull and listless and
she looked, for the first time since Harry had known her, as if she
was wearing last season's robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't have
to be afraid," Parvati tried again. "There are no wolves, no
werewolves."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't help
it, he's still out there," Lavender cried. "What if he comes
back to finish the job? What if he brings friends? They could get
you, too!" Parvati shrugged wearily as if they had this
conversation every day.</p><p class="calibre8">"The werewolves
aren't even organised anymore," she said. "Greyback's a
fugitive with a price on his head. He couldn't show his face around
here without being captured."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't see any
Aurors patrolling," said Lavender bitterly. "Who? Who's going
to catch him?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron, probably,"
said Parvati. Lavender snorted softly. "I'm serious. He's right
over there-" Parvati turned to gesture across the street and
stopped abruptly as she spotted Harry standing awkwardly in the
doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry, I just …
well … hello," Harry stammered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" gasped
Parvati, standing up and crossing swiftly to give Harry a brief hug
which he attempted unsuccessfully to return. "What are you doing
here? I thought you were at Hogwarts?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I was, I am,"
said Harry. "I had some things to do." Lavender, who had been
silent until then, suddenly uncurled herself and stood up. She looked
scared and Harry wondered if she was about to dive into the Floo.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why did Bill
Weasley come the other day?" she asked softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He wanted to see
how you were," Harry guessed wildly. "We've heard you've been
under the weather." Lavender laughed a short, bitter laugh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I guess
that's one way of putting it," she said, "seriously, why him?
He doesn't even know me and he's scary."</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
concerned," Harry said. "Bill wanted to talk to you because he,
he-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because he got
attacked by a werewolf too?" asked Lavender. "Did he want to
compare stories? Compare <em class="calibre9">scars</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill's not like
that-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Everybody's
like that!" Lavender screeched suddenly. "Everybody wants to know
about my scars, what they look like, how I <em class="calibre9">feel</em>. Well I'll
tell you Harry Potter, I feel scared. I feel ugly and I feel like any
day now they're going to come back; come back and finish it off!"
She stood hands clenched and face flushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I'm scared
too," said Harry quietly. "Scared they are going to take away my
godson." Lavender looked at him in confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your godson?"
she echoed blankly. "Who's your godson?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy Lupin,"
answered Harry. "<em class="calibre9">Professor Lupin's</em> son."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why would anyone
take him away?" Lavender looked confused.</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't know,
do you?" questioned Harry. Lavender shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Know what?" she
asked exasperatedly. "I never even met the kid. I didn't even
know Professor Lupin had a son."</p><p class="calibre8">"His name is Teddy
and he's a metamorphmagus like his mother," said Harry. "He's
nearly six months old, favours turquoise hair and is cutting his
first tooth. He lives with his grandmother because his parents were
both killed in the battle at Hogwarts."</p><p class="calibre8">"What has all that
got to do with me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy isn't a
werewolf," said Harry quietly, "but they still want to take him
away because his father was one."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well that's
ridiculous," scoffed Lavender. "Who would do that? Why would
they? And why are you telling <em class="calibre9">me</em> all this?"</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a
Ministry worker in the Department for the Care and Control of Magical
Creatures who is trying to pass legislation to control werewolves,"
said Harry. He hadn't moved from the doorway and watched as
Lavender came a few steps closer. The meagre light from the veiled
window threw her face into stark relief and Harry could see the bones
standing out sharply, casting shadows and making her look almost
skeletal.</p><p class="calibre8">"You just said
he's not a werewolf," challenged Lavender.</p><p class="calibre8">"The legislation
is meant to cover more than just actual werewolves," explained
Harry. "To protect the general public, it is to cover anyone who is
a descendant of or has been attacked by a werewolf." Lavender
stared at him silently. Suddenly she reached hand up and wrenched at
her robes, pulling them aside jerkily and ripping the neckline to
expose three jagged slashes that tore across her left shoulder and
ran down her arm and chest, disappearing below the folds of her torn
robes. They were not quite healed, a smaller replica of Bill's, and
what looked like teeth marks appeared to be mingled with the scars
near her collarbone.</p><p class="calibre8">"Attacked like
this?" she spat. Harry swallowed heavily and nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I suspect just
like that," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lav," moaned
Parvati.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who?" Lavender
asked harshly. "Who wants to do this?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Moses Brown,"
answered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Uncle Moses?"
Lavender repeated weakly, her robes still hanging limply from her
left arm. She sat down abruptly on a nearby loveseat and stared
blankly at the wall. "Why would he do this to me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well he's
trying to protect you," began Harry but stopped abruptly when
Lavender began laughing hysterically. Parvati hurried over to her,
murmuring soothing words and tried to pull her robes back into place.
Lavender shook her off; gestured her arms wildly, her left arm moving
stiffly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's not trying
to protect me!" she cried. "He hates me! He always has!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well that's
what he said," Harry protested. "You are taking everything hard.
He wants you to get better so if the werewolves are all controlled
they can't possibly come and get you."</p><p class="calibre8">"He's lying!
Don't you see?" Lavender hissed, stilling her movements and
staring at Harry. "He knows it will mean locking me up too, and
then I can't turn on him. We're all living in the same house
right now, Uncle Moses, my cousins, my parents and I. Aunt Josephine
was killed at the start of the year, just after Christmas when their
house was torched. Uncle Moses was at the Ministry and the children
were with my mum that day but my Aunt and the house … gone.</p><p class="calibre8">"So they moved in
with us. I was still at school but mum sent me an Owl. Elspeth is
starting Hogwarts next year and Moses junior is still only six. Uncle
Moses wants to move out but he doesn't know how he'll go to work
and care for them. Mum looks after the children so Uncle Moses
doesn't have to find paid help. We have heaps of room but he
insists on them all sleeping in the same room and he locks the door
at night. Mum and Dad have told him he's welcome to stay as long as
he likes, but he can't afford anything right now. The cost of
magical construction is pretty high and insurance payments aren't
coming through very fast.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's terrified
of me Harry! He thinks I'm going to go crazy on the full moon and
turn them all into werewolves! Dad tried to tell me Uncle Moses was
just concerned when I woke up the other night yelling and screaming,
but I could see him – he had fear in his eyes, Harry! He thought I
was turning into a werewolf. I wasn't. I was running from them in
my nightmares."</p><p class="calibre8">"So … you didn't
know about this?" Harry sank down onto the loveseat next to
Lavender. She shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," she
whispered. "I didn't know he'd moved from locking himself up to
locking me up. Doesn't he understand what we fought for?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I guess not,"
said Parvati softly. Lavender turned beseeching eyes on Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't let
him do this," she pleaded. "You have to do something."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione's
researching now," nodded Harry. "We've got about a week until
the next hearing of the matter before the Wizengamot."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,"
Lavender smiled softly. "She saved me you know. I heard her throw
that … that monster off me. I thought she hated me."</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Harry
protested. "She …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh don't be
silly, Harry," Lavender laughed, a soft giggle that sounded more
like the Lavender Harry had known for years and not the terrified
shell of a girl sitting next to him. "I knew how she felt about Ron
and she knows I did and I went after him anyway. I was determined to
be better than her in just one thing ... well two things really, as
I'm sure she still has … issues with her hair. We all knew
everybody's romantic secrets."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it wasn't
exactly a secret how Hermione and Ron felt about each other," said
Parvati. Harry snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"She never
admitted it though, did she?" contested Lavender. "Not to any of
the boys. I bet she didn't even tell Harry!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sure they
all knew," said Parvati. "None of them are quite as dense as
that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well it
probably took them longer to figure it out than us," Lavender
asserted with some authority.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" exclaimed
Harry. "I knew! I knew in … um … definitely by sixth year."
Parvati rolled her eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"About three years
later than the rest of us," she said. "It took me ages to
convince Padma to go to the Yule Ball with him. You are lucky I had a
minor crush on you, Harry Potter, or we would have turned you both
down!" Harry stared at her in shock.</p><p class="calibre8">"You what?" he
asked weakly. Lavender burst into peals of laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Padma was going
to ask Neville, but he asked Ginny so she decided not to go at all,"
Parvati explained. "I saw you mooning after Cho, so I wasn't
about to embarrass myself by asking you. We were going to boycott the
ball entirely. Then you asked me and I was just so desperate to go
with you I <em class="calibre9">had</em> to talk Padma into going with Ron because we
all knew he was carrying a torch for Hermione."</p><p class="calibre8">"Didn't Padma
want to go with Justin?" asked Lavender. "When did she decide to
ask Neville?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, she wanted to
go with Zacharias," said Parvati rolling her eyes, "had a
dreadful crush on him. I was ever so glad when she got over <em class="calibre9">him</em>.
Could you imagine having <em class="calibre9">him</em> for a brother-in-law? I'll tell
you who did ask her though – Blaise Zabini."</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" gasped
Lavender. "She never told us that!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, she
wouldn't would she? A Slytherin asking her to the Ball; I mean
who'd want to admit that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well at least it
wasn't those two who kept hanging around Malfoy!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh puh-lease!"
scoffed Parvati fluttering a hand at Lavender. "Those two were as
gay as the day is long."</p><p class="calibre8">"Please," said
Harry plaintively, "you are making my head hurt. I thought Padma
wanted to go with Neville?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no, she wanted
to go with Zacharias," stated Parvati expertly as she sat next to
Harry on the loveseat, effectively wedging him in the middle. "See,
she wanted to go with Zacharias but she had such a crush on him that
she couldn't possibly ask him so she thought about Justin for a
while, but he took … um, Susan or Hannah or somebody; some
Hufflepuff." She dismissed it with a wave of her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"So why ask
Neville?" asked Harry, entirely confused.</p><p class="calibre8">"To make Zacharias
jealous, of course," said Lavender. "But she waited too long and
all the good ones were taken." Harry snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Except you and
Ron," added Parvati. "She refused, utterly refused at first. I
had to beg her."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not going
with that arse," Lavender said, in a high pitched tone that
mimicked an outraged Padma Patil. "I thought I was going to die
when Hermione said there was nothing wrong with Ron's arse."
Parvati burst out laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just … stop,"
pleaded Harry. "It was torture at the time, let's not relive it!"
He was pinned between the two girls on the loveseat as they fluttered
and giggled their way through reminiscences of their romantic
adventures.</p><p class="calibre8">"We all thought
Hermione was going with Michael Corner, remember?" Parvati giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"She wouldn't
tell us a thing about her date," said Lavender, "and Corner
wouldn't tell."</p><p class="calibre8">"Did he go stag?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I think he
went with … that Luna girl?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, it was a
Hufflepuff from third year," said Parvati. "I remember the look
of disgust on Susan's face. I think it was like her cousin or
something?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh! That's
right and she was so excited to go and then he ignored her all night,
staring at Ginny Weasley!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But she was all
right, Susan's cousin," clarified Parvati. "I mean isn't that
where she met that Ravenclaw she's going out with now? Roger
Davies' best friend's little brother?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes! Yes!"
squealed Lavender, she lowered her voice conspiratorially and leaned
across Harry. "I heard you know, that they … did it, before she
went back to Hogwarts. He's working at that law firm now. Just the
coffee boy, but still; he'll be up and coming before you know it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well if you are
going to give yourself away like that," sniffed Parvati, "I
suppose with someone who works in a law firm is a better bet than
some bum off the street."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I don't
know," mused Lavender. "Imagine doing it and then being locked
away at Hogwarts. I mean wouldn't you have gotten a … taste for
it? What do you think, Harry?" They both turned to pin their gaze
on him and Harry felt his face heat up magnificently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I erm, well I
wouldn't know," he muttered, casting about for a way to escape.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, of course,"
Parvati smiled and patted his arm. "It must be so heavenly to be
with Ginny all the time." She sighed and Lavender giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"This has been
great, catching up," said Harry, levering himself out of the seat
with difficulty. "I, um, have to go. It's been great, really.
I'll keep you updated." He scurried out of the shop and across
the road to Weasley's Wizard Wheezes as fast as he could, leaving
the two girls giggling on the loveseat and waving airily at him.</p><p class="calibre8">The doorbell clanged
horribly as he opened the door and jumped in surprise.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi! I thought you
got rid of that thing!" he yelled. George popped his head up from
behind the counter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no, my good
man!" he crowed. "I fixed it! You were a long time in there,
started to think they devoured you alive. I was about to send a
search party, see if we needed to rescue you from the lace and
frills." Ron emerged from behind the counter.</p><p class="calibre8">"You did not fix
it!" he glowered. "It sounds worse than ever. Just get rid of
it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But Dad would be
crushed!" protested George. "That was a gift, that was!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh don't
pretend like you care what Dad thinks," murmured Ron wearily. He
said it very quietly and Harry did not think George was supposed to
have heard it, but George had turned his head at that moment so his
ear was facing Ron and must have caught every word.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you mean,
'I don't care what Dad thinks'?" he asked harshly. Ron
stiffened.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing," he
mumbled and started walking towards the back room. "Here, Harry.
I'll get you some real chocolate to take back to Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you walk
away from me!" shouted George. Harry stayed hovering in the
doorway, unsure whether to intervene or not.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why not?" Ron
bellowed back. "You do it all the time! I don't even know where
you <em class="calibre9">were</em> the last week! I covered for you! I told Dad you were
at Lee's house for the weekend. For all I know you could have drunk
yourself into a stupor in some ditch somewhere!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I was with
Angie!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah?" asked
Ron sarcastically. "Shagging your dead brother's girlfriend,
that's real nice." George, who had been red in the face, suddenly
went white.</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't know
anything," he said. "You don't know anything!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You're right, I
don't!" snarled Ron. "You don't bother telling me anything.
You just take off for who knows where – different woman or pub each
night probably, leaving me to tell Mum why you aren't home for
dinner. Last night I had to tell her you'd practically moved back
in here and then she wanted to come around and clean up for you and
stuff. You're lucky Percy chose that moment to come moping in the
door and sighing heavily. She turned all her guilt on him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Guilt?" Harry
ventured but he was drowned out by George who began to shout.</p><p class="calibre8">"WHAT DO YOU MEAN
DIFFERENT WOMEN?" he bellowed. "How <em class="calibre9">dare</em> you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I've seen you
with a lot of witches," Ron said matter-of-factly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not recently,"
George retorted, glaring at Ron menacingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wouldn't know,
would I," said Ron. "Haven't seen you lately, have I? It was
very nice of you to turn up for work today by the way. Verity was
beginning to wonder and I was running out of plausible excuses."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well I'm
back now," George said through clenched teeth.</p><p class="calibre8">"The point is –
where have you been?"</p><p class="calibre8">"None of your
business," retorted George sullenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes it is, it's
half mine," growled Ron. "You and Harry gave it to me."</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said
Harry, panicked. "That was Fred's half." Ron rolled his eyes at
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you all think
I'm completely stupid?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe the shop's
half yours," said George quietly, "but my personal life isn't
any of your business no matter how you slice it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Where were you?"
Ron pleaded this time. "Mum's worried. She pretended she wasn't
but it's only because Perce needs her that she's not run off
looking for you."</p><p class="calibre8">"What's wrong
with BigHead?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Penelope broke it
off with him and he's a broken shell of a man," replied Ron.
George raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Broken shell? I
didn't know you were so poetic, mate."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron's
apparently very poetic and romantic," murmured Harry without
thinking.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Ron
yelped. "What did Hermione tell you?" Harry flushed a brilliant
red and George snickered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing," said
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Much," added
George. Harry glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just … come
home for dinner tonight," said Ron, "show Mum that you are alive
and in one piece. I don't care what you do; live above the shop
with a harem drinking elderberry wine and eating cupcakes or marry a
Muggle and dwell on a mountaintop in Wales for all I care. Just
please show Mum your face once in a while."</p><p class="calibre8">"Alive and in one
piece?" George said dully. "Is that what this is called, this …
existence?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
talking about?" muttered Ron tiredly. "You're acting very
strangely."</p><p class="calibre8">"No I'm not,"
said George immediately. He plastered a wide smile on his face that
was undeniably fake. "I'm fine. See?" Ron raised an eyebrow at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You have been
moping about here for months looking like somebody died," said Ron.
Harry gaped at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone <em class="calibre9">did</em>
die, you <em class="calibre9">git</em>!" George burst out, his face furious. Ron
ignored him entirely.</p><p class="calibre8">"And now, here you
are suddenly looking all bright and <em class="calibre9">chipper</em> like you've been
hit with Flitwick's strongest Cheering Charm. Something's not
right," Ron said, leaning against the doorframe casually, his arms
crossed over his chest; one leg hooked in front of the other. George
looked as though Ron had just hit a Bludger into his stomach.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron-" Harry
started but Ron cut him off.</p><p class="calibre8">"If you're going
to tell me to go easy on him, don't," he said shortly. "I can't
do this anymore. I can't tiptoe around things. It's not something
I do. I can't take any more pretending Mum's coping or that
George is okay. Mum's <em class="calibre9">not </em>coping. George is <em class="calibre9">not</em>
okay."</p><p class="calibre8">"I am, I'm
fine," said George weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop it! Just
stop it!" Ron cried. "Stop pretending you're fine. Stop
pretending you don't look for women to distract you. Stop
pretending you aren't drinking every night. Stop pretending
everything's okay!"</p><p class="calibre8">There was a long
moment where no one said anything. Harry stood motionless in the
doorway and George was breathing heavily in the middle of the shop.
Ron was standing near the back of the shop, tense and holding his
breath. Harry wondered if he should leave but Ron shot him a look
that clearly told him to guard the door. Harry stayed exactly where
he was, waiting.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't try
Apparating," Ron said. "Hermione taught me an anti-Apparition
ward. If you try it you'll Splinch yourself. Splinching's really
unpleasant." Harry raised his eyebrow at Ron who stared at George
impassively. Harry turned and carefully flipped the sign on the door
to <em class="calibre9">'closed'</em> and fastened the latch.</p><p class="calibre8">George said nothing.</p><p class="calibre8">"You didn't look
hung over this morning at least," began Ron conversationally. "So
that's something."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's because
I didn't get drunk last night," said George softly. He turned to
stare out the window. Harry shifted uncomfortably as George's gaze
swept over him and settled on something in the distance.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where have you
been?" asked Ron quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told you, with
Angie," answered George. His white knuckled hands were clenched
into fists and his arms hung rigidly at his sides.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you … well,
d'you think that's … healthy?" stammered Ron. George chuckled
mirthlessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not in the
slightest," he replied harshly, "which is why it makes me an
utter bastard."</p><p class="calibre8">"George …" Ron
trailed off as George sank to the floor, cradling his head in his
hands. "George, what happened?" Ron moved closer to George
slowly, as if approaching a frightened animal.</p><p class="calibre8">"I met her,"
George said. "Angie. At the pub."</p><p class="calibre8">"Which one?"
asked Ron dryly. George made a rude gesture at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not the point,"
he muttered. "She … wasn't doing too good. Probably drank a
little more than was healthy." Ron snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"When was this?"
Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um … Friday I
think," George squinted. "I can't really remember which day it
was, they sort of blurred into each other after that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Days? Just how
long was this bender?" asked Ron harshly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know!"
wailed George. "Two days, three maybe. We weren't really looking
at the clock."</p><p class="calibre8">"We?" yelped
Ron. "Angelina went on this bender <em class="calibre9">with</em> you?" George
winced.</p><p class="calibre8">"For a few <em class="calibre9">days</em>?"
said Harry incredulously. "What were you <em class="calibre9">doing</em>?" George
blushed magnificently.</p><p class="calibre8">"You didn't,"
Ron groaned. George didn't move. "You did, didn't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't mean
to," George moaned. "It just sort of happened. <em class="calibre9">She </em>wanted
it."</p><p class="calibre8">"She was <em class="calibre9">Fred's</em>
girlfriend," hissed Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, I know."</p><p class="calibre8">"You took
advantage of her," Ron raised his voice and glared at George.</p><p class="calibre8">"She wanted to!"
protested George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only because you
look like Fred!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know! I know!"
George buried his face in his arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"HOW COULD YOU DO
THAT?" Ron shouted.</p><p class="calibre8">"BECAUSE SHE'S
THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS!" George shouted back. "She's the only
one who misses him like I do. They broke up, but it was never Lee. He
knew it. He knew she'd go back to Fred. She always did. This is
killing her Ron, just like it's killing me." There were tears
running down George's face as he looked up at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"But why?" asked
Ron. "If you know it's Fred she wants, why would you do this to
her?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because this is
the only way I can <em class="calibre9">feel</em>," sobbed George. "Nothing means
anything any more. I pretend that it does; but really, no one needs
me anymore, not the way Fred needed me. We needed each other. I don't
feel like getting up in the morning. I don't feel like coming into
the shop. I don't feel like eating. I don't feel like anything.</p><p class="calibre8">"And even though I
can't feel anything, it still hurts! It's bloody unfair! How can
I not <em class="calibre9">feel</em> anything and still <em class="calibre9">hurt</em>? She's hurting too
Ron and I made it go away. How can that be wrong? I felt <em class="calibre9">good</em>
for the first time in ages and she needed me. Somebody <em class="calibre9">needed</em>
me. She wanted to, I swear. I didn't force her."</p><p class="calibre8">"I never thought
you did," said Ron quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"First we cried,"
George stared into the distance. "Made a great blubbering mess all
over the Hogs Head. Aberforth told us if we were going to make that
much noise we could go somewhere else. So we bought a couple bottles
of Firewhisky and came back here. Merlin, the flat's a mess. I
think we passed out in the sitting room. I woke up there the next
morning anyway; head pounding like Hagrid was beating on the door.
Angie wasn't much better off, but I heard you come in to open up
the shop so we grabbed the last bottle and Apparated to Angie's
place.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seemed to her if
we kept drinking the headache might go away, so we did and that's …
that's when …"</p><p class="calibre8">"If you hadn't
been completely pissed out of your gourd, would you have …" Ron
gestured with his hands. George smirked at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Done the deed?
Danced the horizontal tango?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ugh, you make it
sound so …" Ron shuddered, "tawdry."</p><p class="calibre8">"It wasn't like
that," George said, suddenly serious. "Even though I was pissed
out of my skull, I think it was the most meaningful … well the most
meaningful <em class="calibre9">time</em> I've had."</p><p class="calibre8">"If you were that
drunk, can you even remember how meaningful it was?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, sure I
don't remember a lot of the first time," George admitted. "That
one's a bit hazy, but we started drinking less and … well, making
love more." Harry shifted uncomfortably by the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's a bit,
um … it's a bit meaningful," muttered Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"But it was, Ron,
it was," George said urgently. "I felt … whole again for a
while. She made me feel something and it wasn't pain."</p><p class="calibre8">"And then you
sobered up, didn't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," George
breathed out a heavy sigh. "Oh Merlin, Ron, she doesn't feel the
same way. She doesn't want me, she wants Fred. What have I done?
How could I <em class="calibre9">do</em> this to her? Just to try and make myself feel
better? Because I can't; I can't feel better. I can never feel
whole."</p><p class="calibre8">"But you said you
did with her," argued Ron. "You <em class="calibre9">said</em> she made you feel
whole."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't,"
muttered George shaking his head. "I can't do it to her, she
deserves better than me. I'm only half a person. I left. I left
about two days ago and came back here. I couldn't face her. I
couldn't face <em class="calibre9">you</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"So you put on
that silly front and tried to make yourself look, what … sane?"
scoffed Ron. "I told you. I'm not that stupid."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron," George
said suddenly. "What am I going to do?" Ron shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know,"
he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"But you have
heaps of practice at stuffing things up with a girl!" George turned
to him, pleading. Ron pushed him on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"You idiot," he
said but he was almost smiling. "I think you need to talk to Dad."
George shook his head frantically.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, he'll tell
Mum!"</p><p class="calibre8">"And she'll look
at you with that face …" Both of them shivered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Definitely not,"
murmured George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill," said Ron
decisively. "You need to talk to Bill."</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"
grimaced George. "He's very … proper. What about Charlie?" He
finished with a hopeful look on his face. Ron shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah, Charlie's
no good," said Ron pensively. "He spends too much time with
dragons; he can't tell you anything about women. Now Percy …"
The two brothers looked at each other and shook their heads
simultaneously.</p><p class="calibre8">"That leaves you
or …" George swivelled to look at Harry. He eyed him for a moment
before shaking his head. "It leaves Bill."</p><p class="calibre8">************************</p><p class="calibre8">Lavender was
standing in the Ministry Atrium when Harry, Ron and Hermione arrived
the following Saturday. She looked almost as frail as she had when
Harry had seen her the week before, but in her eyes there was
something more, a spark of renewed vigour; of determination.</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope you don't
mind I came," she said nervously, twisting her robes between her
fingers. "Parvati said Ron dropped a note in about a hearing about
… it today I … I had to come." She was looking at Harry but
they all knew she was talking to Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's good that
you came," Hermione reassured her quietly. "Harry told me about
your uncle. It will probably make him nervous if he sees you there
and you'll … need to deal with things. You can sit with Ron and
Harry. Kingsley asked me to meet with him about my research. I think
he wants me to help present something."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't know
that," said Ron. Hermione nodded, her eyes gleaming.</p><p class="calibre8">"Isn't it great?
He sent me an Owl last night," she said. "I'd better go. You
can look after Lavender, can't you?" She kissed him briefly on
the cheek, patted Harry's arm and strode confidently towards the
lifts.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, we'd
better go to the courtroom, I suppose," Ron said eventually.</p><p class="calibre8">"I need to wait
here for Andromeda," answered Harry. Ron shrugged and the three of
them stood awkwardly in the Atrium for several long and uncomfortable
minutes. Ron stared intently at the floor and Lavender began
inspecting her robes, intermittently plucking off something miniscule
that Harry assumed was fluff.</p><p class="calibre8">He wondered how
Hermione had seemed so at ease when Ron and Lavender were still
unable to even look at each other. He knew something of how hard it
was to deal with a relationship that had ended. He was still uneasy
around Cho because she had a tendency to act unpredictably, but his
actual feelings for her had simply faded. His break up with Ginny had
been different because neither of them had wanted to be apart.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had little
experience with the type of palpable tension that currently existed
between Ron and Lavender. It was a sort of undefinable feeling that
something wasn't quite finished. As if they didn't know how to
behave at all.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry reflected
rather bitterly that perhaps he understood it more than he was
willing to admit. The rather vague sort of feeling that one did not
know where to put oneself and what gestures would be welcomed was one
he had become increasingly familiar with all week. He had left
Weasley's Wizard Wheezes last Friday with a lecture from Bill
ringing in his ears. It had not been enough for Bill to berate George
for his incredibly short-sighted and stupid behaviour. Bill had lined
up all three of them and given them a lecture about respecting women.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had attempted
to beg off under the guise of not actually being of Weasley blood,
but had to abandon all thoughts of escape when George fixed him with
a piercing glare and Ron grabbed the back of his robes, pinning him
in place. While Bill began an impassioned plea for the three of them
to wholly respect the women in their lives, Ron had pulled Harry
surreptitiously closer.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are not
getting out of it mate," he had muttered under his breath. "If I
have to listen because George has been a git, so do you."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had actually
left feeling rather enthusiastic about showing Ginny how much he
loved her, but the woman in question and been in an intolerable mood
all week. Her disposition had not, in fact, improved with the
production of Honeyduke's finest and when Harry got shouted at on
Thursday morning simply for chewing too loudly, George and Ron
received a Howler. Harry tried to spend time with Hagrid in an effort
to stay out of Ginny's way, but the groundskeeper kept refusing to
let him in.</p><p class="calibre8">"Go an' enjoy
th' bracin' mountain air," said Hagrid, overly casually. "Afore
it gets too cold; off you go." He slapped Harry on the back, giving
him a not so gentle push as he did so, sending him stumbling onto the
path to the lake.</p><p class="calibre8">Professor Fiesche
had continued to glare at Harry while being perfectly pleasant to
everyone else and Draco Malfoy had ceased any pretence of convivial
feeling, scowling at Harry across the table during Potions and making
sarcastic remarks as he watched the seventh year Defence students
practice basic duelling. A troupe of third year students took to
following Harry around and asking when he was planning to have
Quidditch try-outs. Every time he turned around he stumbled over one
of them or the awed first and second years who seemed to stop
stock-still in the middle of corridors and passageways whenever he
walked past. On more than one occasion Ginny had growled at the
younger students and extricated herself before stalking off. If
Hermione was with him she was more amused than annoyed.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had tried to
ask Hermione if she had any ideas about why Ginny was so irritable
and snapping at anyone who looked at her, but Hermione had been a
frazzled whirlwind. She wandered the castle with quills and bits of
parchment sticking out of her pockets and her nose in dusty books
from the Restricted Section. She continually pressed hastily
scribbled notes about werewolves and wolfsbane into his hands and
demanded attention to things Harry only barely understood.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you think
this is a good precedent, Harry?" she pressed him one day. She had
shoved a book under his nose at the lunch table and nearly sent a jug
of pumpkin juice flying. Neville's quick thinking had stopped it
careening into Ginny's lap. Harry shot Neville a grateful look.
Neville shrugged and nodded before returning to his food. Harry had
been in the library with Hermione the night before. Dean told him
that Ginny had bawled Neville and Dennis Creevey out for turning
pages too loudly in the common room. Harry figured Neville was alert
to the tightly strung ball of tension that was Ginny Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry tried to pay
attention to Hermione as he watched Ginny eat. She was pale and
scowling as she played with the food on her plate. Harry muttered
agreements to Hermione as she prattled, but his attention was on
Ginny. She looked up and he smiled tentatively. Ginny just sighed and
gathered her bag up. Harry grasped her hand before she could leave.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right,
Ginny?" he asked softly. He noticed that everyone was carefully
eating or had started very animated and involved conversations. Ginny
looked around slowly before she nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,"
she muttered, "library." Then she was gone. And so as he stood
watching Ron and Lavender shift uncomfortably as if there was a
hippogriff in the room, Harry wondered if it felt like he had all
week. Like he was standing just a little left of where he should be,
in a slowly thickening mist and unable to move into the right spot to
see clearly or know what to say.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron had begun
tapping his wand nervously against his leg when Bill and Fleur
arrived. To Harry's surprise Fleur was carrying Teddy perched on
one hip, looking around curiously. He had one fist in his mouth and
drool was slowly sliding down into his cuff. Ron looked at Bill and
Fleur as if their entrance was water to a drowning man.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi Bill!" he
called exuberantly, dropping his wand with a loud clatter. Teddy
jumped at the commotion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello Ron,"
said Bill with an amused smirk. "Andromeda just stopped at … well
she'll erm, be here in a minute, Harry."</p><p class="calibre8">"What's Teddy
doing here?" asked Harry staring at the baby. "This is no place
for Teddy." Little chubby baby fists stopped trying to grab at
Fleur's long hair as Harry spoke and Teddy twisted himself around
in her grasp.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum's taking
him for the day," explained Bill. "Kreacher is perfectly capable
but Mum … well ..."</p><p class="calibre8">"She wants
grandchildren," interjected Ron. Bill rolled his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Da!" Teddy
cried. "Ba! Da!" He squirmed in Fleur's arms, his
drool-drenched fist waving in the air and his hair slowly turning
black. Harry reached out for the baby who threw himself bodily in
Harry's direction, squealing. Harry grimaced as one soggy fist
swiped at his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did he just call
you 'Da'?" Bill smirked.</p><p class="calibre8">"He calls
everybody 'Da'!" exclaimed Harry, wiping his face with
difficulty as Teddy bounced on his other arm, grasping at Harry's
neck. "Watch … who's this Teddy?" Harry pointed in Bill's
direction. Teddy stopped bouncing and stared solemnly at Bill for a
moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Da!" the baby
proclaimed. "Da, da, da!" Harry turned in Lavender's direction</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's that,
Teddy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Da! Da!"
squealed Teddy. "Ba da la!"</p><p class="calibre8">"See," said
Harry smugly as Teddy turned to him and grabbed at his cheek with one
pudgy hand. "Everybody is 'Da'."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, but not
everybody gets that cuddle," said Ron as Teddy lay his head on
Harry's shoulder and stuffed his fist back into his mouth. "That,
he reserves for you." Harry looked down at the soft downy head and
smiled as he dropped a kiss there.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," he
said softly and Teddy sighed and closed his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"That just makes
me all clucky," said Lavender.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oui," murmured
Fleur, "and you weel make a good father for Ginny's babies."
She turned at looked at Bill suggestively.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" he asked
her.</p><p class="calibre8">" C'est trop
mauvais étaient debout dans le Ministère parce que je suis si
allumé en ce moment je pourrais vous faire l'amour et faire vos
beaux bébés pendant toute la nuit," purred Fleur. Bill blushed
profusely and shifted behind his wife before clearing his throat with
difficulty.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's Ginny?"
he asked Harry, his voice cracking on the first syllable. Ron shared
a brief glance with Lavender and rolled his eyes at her. Lavender
giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, well …
McGonagall," said Harry. "She … with me and Hermione leaving
Hogwarts for the day she wasn't about to let one of the Prefects
leave if the Head Boy and Girl were both gone. She and Neville have
the unenviable task of supervising the Quidditch pitch. Dennis
Creevey offered to help some of the first years practice their
flying." Ron laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"So you mean
Ginny's supervising?" he chuckled. "What's Neville going to
do? Show them how not to fall off?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron!" gasped
Lavender. "Don't be so mean! Neville is a very accomplished
wizard."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, but not
with his broomstick," sniggered Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh what would you
know," Lavender scoffed. "He's a little better at flying than
he was in first year!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oho, sounds like
you know him <em class="calibre9">much</em> better," smirked Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up,
Weasley," muttered Lavender.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh come on,"
Ron said, swinging and arm around her shoulders casually. "Don't
be like that." Lavender stiffened slightly as he made contact with
her left shoulder, but she didn't move away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like what?" she
mumbled. Ron didn't answer her. He steered her in the direction of
the lifts.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on, let's
go get a seat so we can watch Harry make funny faces at the baby
while Hermione tells your uncle to just get -"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ronald Weasley!
Language!" A harried voice came from the opposite direction. Molly
and Andromeda were hurrying towards them. "Stop that thought, right
there. Harry dear, lovely to see you. Now where is this gorgeous
boy?" She lifted Teddy out of Harry's arms and the baby grabbed
at her red curls.</p><p class="calibre8">"Da!" he said
proudly. "Daaaa!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I think he
called me 'Nan'," said Molly. Andromeda chuckled as she handed
Molly a large bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"He calls everyone
that," she said smiling. "If I listen closely it sounds like Gran
some days."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, young
Teddy," said Molly turning her attention back to the baby. "Let's
go and see what mischief you can get up to with Nanna Molly. Say
bye-bye to Gran." Teddy waved a little fist.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ba!" he called.</p><p class="calibre8">"See," smirked
Ron. "She wants grandchildren."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not from you,
Ronald Weasley," said Molly severely. Ron turned alternately white
and then red as her words sunk in. His mother ignored him and turned
to Andromeda. "Now don't you worry, Teddy and I will be just
fine." Andromeda nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,
Molly," she said. Molly nodded briskly at them before she set off
for the entrance, chattering away to Teddy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay, now we can
go," said Ron impatiently. He turned to Lavender, his earlier
awkwardness vanished. "So, if I come into the shop this week, could
you do me a reading? I rather fancy knowing what my tea leaves might
say."</p><p class="calibre8">"You hate
Divination," retorted Lavender.</p><p class="calibre8">"No I don't,"
protested Ron. "It's dead useful."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know you're
just trying to make me feel better," she said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is it working?"
Ron asked. Lavender smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah."</p>
