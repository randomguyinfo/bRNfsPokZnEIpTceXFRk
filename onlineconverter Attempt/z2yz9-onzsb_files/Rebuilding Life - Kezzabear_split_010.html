<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_11">*Chapter 10*: Chapter 10</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Memorial</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Every
muscle and bone he had ached. His head throbbed and if he opened his
eyes pain stabbed through them like knives. It didn't hurt this
much to die. That was how he knew he was alive.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
he heard a soft voice, "Harry, can you hear me?" Harry groaned
and felt a warm touch on his cheek. He tried to open his eyes but it
hurt too much. He heard the voice again and leaned into the hand that
was stroking his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum
is he going to be okay?"</p><p class="calibre8">"M-Mum?"
groaned Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
you look at me, Harry?" the soft voice asked again. "Can you open
your eyes and look at me?" Harry tried to open his eyes but the
light hurt his eyes. He shook his head instead but that hurt more and
he moaned in pain.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay Harry. Don't try to move. You just lay there. It's okay to
sleep if you want to," said the soft voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum?"
he whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhh,
yes I'm here, it's okay now, just sleep." And Harry drifted
off, comforted by the soft voice whispering to him and the warm hand
stroking his face.</p><p class="calibre8">*****************</p><p class="calibre8">When
Harry awoke again the pain had receded. He was able to open his eyes
and the soft candlelight that illuminated the room showed he was in
his bed in Gryffindor Tower, the covers tucked neatly around him, a
tray of food kept warm on the bedside table and Mrs Weasley asleep in
the chair pulled up to his bed. Harry put on his glasses and eased
himself up on the pillows.</p><p class="calibre8">In
her sleep Mrs Weasley looked careworn and troubled. Harry could see
the grief she was suffering – and only sometimes managing to hide
when awake – laid bare on her sleeping face. He realised that hers
was the warm hand and soft voice he had heard earlier when he'd
awoken in pain and that she was the one who had whispered she would
stay with him. And she had.</p><p class="calibre8">Carefully,
he could feel no less than four recently repaired bones, and wincing
only slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and took the coverlet from it
and draped it over Mrs Weasley. He didn't feel hungry; he still
felt rather nauseous and as such chose to ignore the food on the
bedside table. After making it to the door without incident he
stepped out of the dormitory in search of company. He could hear a
low rumble coming from the Common Room and hoped that he would not
have to go any further to find Ginny. He needed to see her and if he
had looked as bad as he had felt earlier she needed to see him;
preferably upright.</p><p class="calibre8">As
Harry entered the Common Room unnoticed, he saw George in front of
the fireplace, surrounded by the rest of their team, clutching what
looked suspiciously like a chipped plaster statue of Fred, wildly
gesticulating to the assembled audience. Judging by the look on Ron's
face and the barely concealed laughter on Ginny, Bill and Charlie's,
the subject of George's discourse was probably a trick he and Fred
had once played on Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
going to miss him," he heard George say quietly as the crowd in the
Common Room grew silent. "Anyway, time to be all solemn tomorrow.
Here's to Fred, and Quidditch and to the best Seeker Gryffindor's
ever seen - not Charlie Weasley!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
yeah," grumbled Charlie, "but does he always fall off his broom?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes!"
came a chorus of voices.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!
I do not!" exclaimed Harry. "There's usually at least one game
a year I manage to stay upright!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!"
exclaimed Hermione, "how did you get past Mrs Weasley? Are you
alright? Should you be out of bed? How are you feeling?" She fired
off her questions in a fair imitation of a Muggle machine gun.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
fine, Hermione," said Harry as a red blur came hurtling across the
room, throwing herself at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
awake!" Ginny threw her arms around his neck and he had to throw an
arm out to the wall behind him to ensure he stayed on his feet. "Are
you really okay? Mum shooed me out about half an hour ago so I could
have dinner, she said she'd tell me when you were up!" Harry
wound his arms around her waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
fine," murmured Harry, "especially now." And he buried his face
in her neck, planting kisses along her collarbone.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
doing that to annoy us you know," Charlie's conversational tone
cut through his senses.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
working," stated Ron matter-of-factly.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
what are you going to do about it then?" asked Bill with amusement.</p><p class="calibre8">"Absolutely
nothing," George simpered in falsetto. "Do you iknow/i
who that is?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
replied Percy, "the best Seeker Gryffindor has ever seen!" The
occupants of the Gryffindor Common Room burst out laughing at the
disgruntled look on Charlie's face. Harry directed a rude hand
gesture at George behind Ginny's back, his lips still on her skin.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
zink eet ees sweet," Fleur said dreamily as Harry wound his hand
into Ginny's hair, she arched her neck, exposing her throat for him
to kiss before he moved up to her lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
told them not to do that in front of me – I swear, they are doing
that on purpose!" Ron whined before Hermione shushed him loudly.
Harry pulled away from Ginny and grinned at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
missed you," he whispered. "It's a good thing your mum is
asleep or she would probably have kept me prisoner up there in my
bed. But I needed to see you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
needed to see you too," Ginny whispered back. "Come sit with me?"
Harry nodded. He let her lead him over to a chair by the fireplace
and they sat in it together, curled around each other like a pair of
cats. Harry played drowsily with Ginny's hair as he let the
conversation of others wash over him, eventually succumbing to sleep
in her arms.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">When
Harry awoke from a fitful night's sleep filled with echoing green
flashes and piercing red eyes he was back in his own bed with Ron and
Neville snoring loudly nearby. Mrs Weasley had gone, along with the
dinner tray, and a pristine set of black robes were laid out across
the foot of his bed. He did not want to think on ihow/i
he had been returned to his bed (again!) but the prospect of thinking
about why he had a set of new black robes was even less appealing.</p><p class="calibre8">Today
was not going to be an easy day.</p><p class="calibre8">He
got ready for the day slowly, the rest of the dormitory's occupants
rousing slowly from sleep. Dean and Seamus had also been asleep
behind their curtains and for a few moments Harry could almost
capture the spirit that had echoed throughout his years at Hogwarts
as Neville poked Ron to stop him snoring, Ron grumbled back at him
before lumbering out of bed and into the bathroom, Seamus looked in
vain for socks and Dean straightened out a rather faded looking West
Ham poster that had obviously been left up since sixth year.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
sat on the edge of his bed after tying his shoes, staring into space.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
all right mate?" asked Ron. Harry sighed. What was the answer to
that question anyway? He wasn't dead from the battle or falling
from a broomstick. He was safe and cozy tucked up in the castle. He
wasn't going hungry. He had finished the task he'd been set by
Dumbledore. His whole life stretched out in front of him, Voldemort
free and unfettered. So many things that had not been all right over
the past year were now all right but that didn't mean he was all
right, not today. Today was going to be a difficult day.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
today, I'm not, but soon," Harry replied eventually. "Soon I'll
be all right." He got up, sighed heavily and turned to go down to
breakfast.</p><p class="calibre8">The
mood in the Great Hall was somber. Ron and Harry joined the rest of
the Weasleys and Hermione at the Gryffindor table for breakfast but
nobody was really eating anything. George and Mrs Weasley both looked
pale, the latter showing the beginnings of dark smudges under her
eyes. Eventually even Ron gave up the pretence of eating and they
simply sat there, the murmur of Mr and Mrs Weasley's conversation
about returning to The Burrow a low hum in the background. It seemed
as though Mr Weasley, Bill, Charlie and Percy were planning to return
to the Burrow that morning to ensure all was in readiness for the
family's return the next day.</p><p class="calibre8">The
Memorial Service for those who had fallen during the Battle of
Hogwarts was not due to start until late afternoon and Harry had
little to occupy his thoughts until that time. He had just begun to
think that he could not simply sit in the Great Hall all day and
should do something; anything would do, when he noticed Professor
McGonagall approaching, Kingsley Shacklebolt trailing in her wake.</p><p class="calibre8">"A
word with you if we may, Mr Potter," the Professor asked. She did
not look or sound nearly as severe as she usually did. Harry shrugged
and stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you know the charm required for – for this afternoon, Harry?"
Harry nodded, his memory of the last time he had carved words into
stone making it too difficult to speak.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
good," Professor McGonagall sighed in relief. "Mr Creevey hasn't
yet learnt it. I am afraid it had not occurred to anyone that his
education had not advanced far enough. Ms Granger, I don't suppose
you have time to teach it to him?" Hermione nodded and made to get
up but George stopped her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
go," he said. "I need something to do." As Harry watched George
leave a sudden thought occurred to him, one that had not occurred to
him before. Snape's body was probably still in the Shrieking Shack.
Did any of the Order grasp his true role or what he had ultimately
done? Whose side he was really on? Had anyone understood the nature
of his bravery during that confrontation with Voldemort? Was Snape's
name going to be carved into the gleaming white monument?</p><p class="calibre8">"Kingsley!"
he said breathlessly. "Snape! Has anyone retrieved Professor
Snape's body? Who's carving his name on the monument?"</p><p class="calibre8">"He
has been retrieved," Kingsley rumbled in his deep voice. "We have
been unable to find his next of kin. It appears he doesn't have any
magical family left. At present I do not know who will carve his
name; most likely a Ministry Official or perhaps a member of the
Order will volunteer."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
do it," Harry said firmly. He was aware of several sets of eyes
gazing at him. Resolute he kept his eyes on Kingsley and swallowed
hard. Kingsley inclined his head in a slight nod as he appraised
Harry carefully. Harry squirmed uncomfortably for a moment before
finding his voice. "Er, what was it you came to see me about?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Perhaps
we could use my office, Minister?" suggested Professor McGonagall.
Harry glanced at Ron, Hermione and Ginny before he turned to go,
telling them wordlessly that he would come and find them when he had
finished. Then he turned and followed the temporary Minister for
Magic and Interim Headmistress from the room.</p><p class="calibre8">When
they got to McGonagall's office Kingsley wasted no time, turning to
Harry he got straight to the point.</p><p class="calibre8">"People
are clamouring for an awards ceremony," he began. "More than one
person has asked why I haven't scheduled one to give you the Order
of Merlin. It's obvious they want to see you." Harry stared at
Kingsley, aghast.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
haven't even buried those I lost!" he spat. "I don't
iwant/i some stupid awards ceremony and people
gawking at me! I won't do it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not asking you to Harry," Kingsley's deep voice was placating. "I
just thought perhaps we could make a statement in the iDaily
Prophet/i to satisfy people for now. I wouldn't want to put
your name on anything without speaking to you first though. Will you
speak to someone from the newspaper, just briefly?" Harry glowered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't
you just release a statement that I'm busy mourning the dead right
now and they can all wait until I'm ready?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
yes, I suppose that would be sufficient, but you can't dodge this
forever, Harry." Kingsley sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know I can't," Harry replied, "but I can put it off. I'll
come and see you next week." Kingsley made arrangements for Harry
to contact his secretary and left, saying he would see them that
afternoon. Professor McGonagall turned to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
all here for you Harry, no one will let you go through this alone,"
she paused as Harry studied the floor. "Take your time, you have
time."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
Harry muttered. He had not yet reckoned on the impact to his fame.
It's not that he was stupid and thought it wouldn't impact but he
hadn't exactly had time to reflect on it. His life could turn into
a circus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Anything
else, Professor?" he asked McGonagall.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
nothing else, Mr Potter," she shook her head sadly. She paused for
a moment, clearly considering if she should say something. "When
Albus left you at the Dursley's I argued with him. He convinced me
that you'd be better off away from the fame, until you were ready.
I wish I could spare you now, Harry, but I think now you are ready.
As a child you were far better off, growing up away from all that,
but we can't and shouldn't shield you any longer, you're not a
child anymore." Professor McGonagall paused, "that's not going
to stop Molly Weasley mothering you though. You should let her."
She patted him on the shoulder and ushered him out the door. Harry
spared her half a smile before striding off down the corridors in
search of Ron, Hermione and Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">On
the way out of the Great Hall, after failing to find any Weasleys or
Hermione, he found Dean Thomas and Luna Lovegood and if he wasn't
mistaken they had just been snogging behind a suit of armour that had
been set back crookedly on its plinth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello
Harry," sang Luna. "Ginny said to tell you they've gone up to
the Common Room. Mrs Tonks was with them. I think she wants to talk
to you. I expect a lot of people want to talk to you don't they
Harry?" Harry just nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
we don't, do we Luna?" said Dean. "Er, not that we don't like
you or anything mate but well, you see, things to do, you know…"
He trailed off and Harry failed to hide a smirk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yes, come on I was going to show you my pictures of Flibbering
Flobgobblers," and Luna began tugging on his hand. Harry was not at
all convinced that Dean followed her because he wanted to look at
Flibbering Flobgobblers. He gave Dean a wink and a little salute as
the other man trailed after Luna and then continued up the Grand
Staircase, heading for the Common Room. It was a lengthy procedure
because it seemed the portraits were among those who wanted to talk
to him. At first he politely accepted their congratulations and
effusive thanks but by the fifth floor he was nodding curtly and
striding past, muttering a general thanks to four or five portraits
at a time.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
reached the portrait of the Fat Lady who, without looking up, droned,</p><p class="calibre8">"Password?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,"
Harry began, realising that he had no idea. The first morning he, Ron
and Hermione had found the portrait hanging drunkenly open, the Fat
Lady fled and they had simply crawled through. Since then, he'd
been carried up there unconscious or asleep or someone else had
opened it. "I don't know it." The Fat Lady looked up startled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
it's you! You don't need it!" and the Fat Lady began an
effusive shower of thanks that lasted for several minutes. Finally
managing to get her to stop Harry ventured,</p><p class="calibre8">"So
d'you think I could go in?" The Fat Lady, who had begun crying
with joy (Harry hoped it was joy) sniffed rather loudly, blew her
nose with a noise and a handkerchief that would put Hagrid to shame
and swung open. Harry climbed awkwardly through and then stopped,
transfixed at the sight that greeted him.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
Weasley was sitting in a squashy armchair by the fireplace, Teddy
Lupin cradled in her arms, talking animatedly to him. Sunlight
streamed through the window, reflecting off her hair and Ginny's
face lit up as she spoke softly to the baby who was looking up at her
and smiling. Harry leaned against the wall, at the entrance to the
Common Room and watched her. He had no desire to disturb the tableau
because it was one of the most beautiful things he had seen in quite
some while.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
watched as Ginny made faces at the baby, would she one day cradle his
baby, their baby, and talk lovingly to him? Would she make those
faces at his son? As he watched her bring her face right up to
Teddy's and rub noses with his and then blow a raspberry on his
neck before moving down to do the same to his fat little tummy, Harry
knew without a doubt that one day he wanted her to do that to his
son. To itheir/i baby.</p><p class="calibre8">He
was so caught up in watching Ginny that he did not notice Mrs Tonks
join him. He realised she was standing at his side only when she
spoke softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
quite a picture isn't she?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
felt a blush grace his cheeks at being caught staring at his
girlfriend. It felt wonderful to think that. She hadn't been his
girlfriend for a year, but she was now and Mrs Tonks was right, she
was a picture.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
he breathed. "She's beautiful." Harry turned back to watch
Ginny with the baby once more.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,
could we have a talk? There are a few things I'd like to say,"
Mrs Tonks said hesitantly, as if she feared Harry would refuse.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure,"
began Harry, "I wanted to talk to you the other night but, well
there were a few issues." Harry looked sheepishly at the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yes, issues like shouting matches with young Mr Weasley," Mrs Tonks
was looking at him kindly although he could see the sorrow etched on
her features. She inclined her head towards a small table near one of
the windows and the two of them made their way there, Harry waving at
Ginny as she looked up and saw him. Ginny did not attempt to get up
but simply smiled at him and nodded briefly before turning back to
Teddy and stroking his downy head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry about Ted and about Dora, Mrs Tonks," Harry said as he sat
down.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you, please Harry, call me Andromeda. I think perhaps that we shall
be getting well acquainted in the coming years. It wouldn't do to
stand on ceremony," she smiled a sad smile at him. "Dora and
Remus told me that they had made you Teddy's godfather." She
paused and it seemed as if she wanted him to speak.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
Remus asked me the night he came to tell us Teddy was born," Harry
sighed and ran a hand through his hair nervously. "I don't know a
lot about being a godfather because I never really had mine. But that
just means I want Teddy to have me around. I have no idea what I am
doing but I want to be around for him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know anything about babies Mrs – Andromeda. I'm surprised
I didn't break him the other day. I don't really know him. I want
to though. Can I come and visit sometimes, so that me and Teddy, we
can get to know each other?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
of course you can! Anytime you want to," Andromeda looked wistfully
at her grandson. "He's all I've got left. Sometimes I can't
believe he's all I've got left."</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you or Teddy need anything you know you can ask me," Harry stated.
It was not a question. "If it's within my power, I'll do it."
Andromeda looked at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"There
isn't a lot that isn't within your power, Harry Potter." Harry
blushed. He was not going to let Teddy down. He didn't blame Sirius
for anything that had happened to him but he was also determined that
Teddy would know his godfather and he was going to give him all that
he could. And he needed to start by actually picking him up
voluntarily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
I - can I hold him?" he asked hesitantly. Andromeda smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think if you can pry him away from your lovely young lady you can
hold him as long as you like."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
spent the rest of the morning with his godson. It hadn't taken
Harry long to pry the baby away from Ginny, it seemed Ginny liked
watching Harry with a baby as much as Harry liked watching Ginny with
one.</p><p class="calibre8">Teddy
had a little crease in his forehead that mimicked the one Harry had
often seen on Remus when he was trying to figure something out and
when Teddy changed his hair pink and his little eyes crossed
involuntarily he was the image of his mother. He was fascinated by
Harry's glasses and whenever he saw Ginny it wasn't long before
he changed his hair to a lovely shade of red. It seemed as though he
had a fondness for dragons because that was the toy he most avidly
followed when Harry charmed the stuffed toys in his pram to fly
around him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I'm not going to introduce him to Hagrid then," said Harry. "Not
if he likes dangerous things!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
he just likes it because it's red?" said Ginny thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you think so?" Harry tilted his head to the side and watched Teddy
for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
likes my hair too," answered Ginny. Harry waved his wand and
charmed all the toys red and little Teddy was mesmerised.</p><p class="calibre8">"His
favourite colour is red," Harry smiled as he picked him and nestled
him in the crook of his arm. "It's a good choice mate, I like red
too. Red hair is simply marvelous, especially when it's all shiny
and it smells good." Teddy stared up at Harry. He'd just had a
bottle, Andromeda had changed his nappy and he was looking a little
drowsy. Harry reached out a finger to trail down Teddy's cheek and
the baby's eyes fluttered shut. A few moments later Teddy was
squirming so Harry patted him on his back. He was sure he'd seen
Aunt Petunia do that with a visiting baby once when he was small. It
seemed to help calm him so Harry lay back semi reclined on the couch
he was sitting on and shifted little Teddy to lie with his chest on
Harry's so that he could more easily pat his back. Teddy lifted up
his head and gazed at Harry, making a soft cooing sound.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay little guy," Harry crooned. "You can go to sleep. I'll
still be here when you wake up." Teddy laid his head down on
Harry's chest and Harry began patting his back. The baby sighed and
snuggled closer to Harry, shifting slightly to situate himself over
Harry's heartbeat. Harry watched Teddy drift off and then his eyes
drifted shut as well and the two of them slumbered on the couch in
front of the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">*******************</p><p class="calibre8">"Awwww
isn't that cute."</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
it!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
opened his eyes to find Teddy awake but still cradled on his chest
and Ron sniggering a few feet away while Hermione remonstrated with
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
Ron, have you met my godson?" Harry rose from the couch, walked to
Ron and handed little Teddy to him, stifling a snort as Ron paled and
held the baby most awkwardly. Teddy gazed up at Ron, a look of
fascination on his tiny features, before turning his hair a fetching
shade of red.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
he's a bit of a midget, Harry," said Ron. Hermione made impatient
clucking noises with her mouth and proceeded to sit Ron down in a
nearby chair and instruct him on how to hold a baby. Harry was
stunned to see Ron go along without complaint.</p><p class="calibre8">"Girls
go all mushy when they see a baby." A voice came from his elbow and
Harry turned to see Charlie watching Ron and Hermione as Ron cradled
the infant in the crook of one arm while he pulled faces at him.
Charlie looked sideways at Harry. "Especially a bloke holding a
baby."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
reckon a bloke can go all mushy for a girl if they see her holding
one too, Charlie," Harry said, without missing a beat. He turned to
Charlie and grinned evilly. "Ginny has been holding Teddy most of
the morning." Charlie shot him a disgusted look. Harry just smiled
as he recalled exactly how Ginny had looked that morning, unaware
that Charlie was now looking, shocked, at the expression on Harry's
face.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
in love with her, aren't you?" said Charlie so softly Harry
barely heard him. Harry turned to look at Charlie then.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I reckon I am." Charlie was silent for a moment before he said,</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
in love with you. She has been for years," he paused and smiled.
"You should thank Bill and me. We bought her a picture book for her
fifth birthday. I reckon she's had her heart set on you since
then."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
was the book called?" asked Harry, curious and yet dreading the
answer at the same time.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Boy Who Lived, the Harry Potter Story." Charlie grinned. Harry
rolled his eyes and turned back to see Hermione remonstrating Ron who
appeared to be trying to sing the Chudley Canons theme song to a
protesting Teddy.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
doubt anyone fell in love with anyone else over a picture book,
Charlie," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know what I see, Harry," Charlie said, grinning.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
made picture books? That's mad." Harry paused. "D'you reckon
she still has it?" Charlie stifled a laugh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Positive
mate. I watched her pack it when we went to Muriel's!" Harry
resolved to examine this curious artefact from Ginny's childhood as
soon as possible. Teddy was fussing in Ron's grasp and Harry
stepped forward to relieve him of the burden.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on, let's go and find grandma, little one," he crooned, his
stomach rumbled. "And maybe some lunch."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
felt all the eyes in the Great Hall on him as he strode in, holding a
screaming baby. He noted, thankfully, that he had indeed found
Andromeda and handed the infant over quickly when the woman came
hurrying towards him. Mrs Weasley was looking at Harry rather
thoughtfully and he quickly found a seat next to Ginny, pulling a
plate of sandwiches towards himself. Ginny herself seemed to have
been staring at him with a distant smile on her face and Harry
recalled with a jolt what Charlie had said about girls falling for
blokes with babies and then about her childhood book.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
Ginny," he said casually, "I was thinking about getting Teddy a
book, what sort of wizard storybooks did you read when you were
little?" Ron and George choked on their food and coughed. Bill
turned to look at Charlie, a questioning grin on his face and Ginny
turned bright red.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
well a few different ones, you know, Beedle the Bard, Maida the
Muse," Ginny trailed off and hastily stuffed a sandwich in her
mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
we know Beedle," muttered Hermione. "Bit more intimately than we
ever wanted to really. Say Ginny, did you guys ever have one of the
picture books about Harry? I've never read one and well, there's
bound to be new editions now I'd love to know if you've still got
an old one tucked away somewhere. It'd be fascinating to compare
them." Ginny's brothers, including Percy burst out laughing and
Mr Weasley looked bemused. Ginny turned a deeper shade of maroon and
turned beseechingly to her mother.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know there was one," said Mrs Weasley thoughtfully, not seeing her
daughter at all. "I expect it's somewhere in the attic now."
Ron stopped laughing with some difficulty and looked at Harry who
winked at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum,
I think I know exactly where to find that book," Ron proclaimed.
"As soon as we get iGinny's stuff/i back from
Auntie Muriel's she can get it for you." Ginny made a noise like
a strangled cat and leapt from her chair but Harry caught her wrist
and pulled her back down into his lap. When she failed to pull
herself away from the arms that snaked their way around her waist
Ginny simply buried her face in Harry's chest in embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shame
on you, teasing Ginny like that," he grinned at the assembled red
heads. "I think it's endearing that she's got a Harry Potter
storybook and she's kept it all these years." Ginny's head shot
up and she looked him in the eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
knew? Which one of them told you?" her eyes narrowed as she looked
at her brothers in turn. For their part they collectively began
studying the ceiling of the Great Hall which showed a perfectly
clear, cloudless day. Harry nudged his head into Ginny's neck,
nuzzling her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
be embarrassed, Ginny," Harry said. "I think it's dreadfully
sweet." She grinned evilly at him before switching her attention to
Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
worry Ron," she said. "When I packed my precious childhood
possessions in case of impending doom I also packed all your comics …
oh, and all your letters from Hermione, you know the ones in the box
marked 'Letters from the future Mrs Ronald Weasley'." Ron
turned a spectacular shade of red and turn to growl at her. He looked
ready to lunge across the table at her. Ginny's eyes were dancing
with laughter in a way they had not been for quite some time and
Hermione, faintly pink, was holding onto Ron's arm and whispering
something that was hopefully calming in his ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
enough, you lot," said Mr Weasley mildly. "I'm afraid we need
to finish up and get ready for this afternoon. What did Kingsley want
this morning, Harry? Anything of concern?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Only
if you count increased fame and an Order of Merlin of concern,"
sighed Harry. "There's too much going on to worry about that now.
I managed to put him off but I'm going to have to deal with it
sooner or later. I need to say good-goodbye first." He blinked,
willing the tears to vanish. He'd been having a good day under the
circumstances but now he just felt sad again and he tightened his
hold on Ginny's waist. She leaned into him and Harry let her stroke
one soft hand up and down his arm, soothing him and calming him.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's
words seemed to sober the group at the table and they all returned
silently to eating contemplating the difficult afternoon ahead.</p><p class="calibre8">********************</p><p class="calibre8">As
Harry headed out of the castle he saw hundreds of chairs set out in
rows facing Dumbledore's white marble tomb, a large white marble
slab had been erected next to it, etched with a border of swirling
vines. The sun that hung over the beautiful summer's day caressed
his face as he walked across the grass. He was horribly reminded of
Dumbledore's funeral. Filch standing silently near the castle doors
in the same mothball scented suit did not do much to change that.</p><p class="calibre8">Gripping
Ginny's hand, Harry followed Mr and Mrs Weasley slowly up the aisle
between the seats to a row near the front where they filed in and
took their places, George and Harry sat on the edge of the aisle so
that they could exit easily when their part of the service was
scheduled. Harry, noticing a buzz had erupted nearby and catching a
few words that sounded like 'Harry Potter' slouched in his seat
and reflexively flattened his fringe over his scar. He then concluded
that he wasn't fooling anybody by doing it and he'd better start
getting used to it. He let out a lengthy sigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I know," said George quietly his eyes fixed on the blank white
slab. "I don't know if Dennis is going to hold it together. He
was a mess earlier today." Harry squeezed Ginny's hand tighter in
his grip and clasped his other hand on George's shoulder. The
chairs were filling up slowly and on the small raised dais Kingsley
and Professor McGonagall had taken their seats but it wasn't going
quickly enough for Harry. Every minute he sat there dragged on and
with every minute he heard more and more whispers that sounded like
his name.</p><p class="calibre8">Dennis
Creevey came slowly up the aisle, his footsteps dragging as he got
closer to the front. As he stopped hesitantly near George and Harry,
staring at the great white slab, members of the DA stepped silently
up behind him. Neville slung an arm around the smaller boy's
shoulders and as the rest of the DA filed into the row in front of
Harry, Neville held Dennis while he cried. In an effort to stop the
tears that threatened to spill down his cheeks, Harry shifted his
gaze to stare fixedly at the lone tentacle that the Giant Squid was
waving out of the Lake. A quiet sniff from George indicated that he
had not managed the same. As Harry slipped his arm awkwardly around
George's shoulders Dennis pulled himself from Neville's grasp and
flung himself at George who hugged the younger boy. For a few moments
the three of them huddled together and simply cried, Harry losing his
battle with the falling tears.</p><p class="calibre8">Soon
Dennis had been seated between George and Harry, the Weasleys having
all moved up a seat to make room. The younger boy was pale and shaky,
making no attempt to stop the stream of tears that ran in rivulets
down his face. Harry remained almost motionless, one hand resting in
Ginny's and the other arm along the back of Dennis's chair.
George appeared to be staring fixedly at the back of Neville's
head, one foot tapping a silent but nervous rhythm on the grass. The
low hum of conversation ceased as Kingsley Shacklebolt rose on the
dais and cast a iSonorous/i charm on his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
didn't hear what Kingsley said, mostly. He heard that they were
there to remember those who had died in the battle four days ago. He
heard that they had fought valiantly and were brave. He heard that
the cause they died for was good. And he heard that the world was
safe and their deaths not in vain. He could also hear the
contradictory sound of birds chirping in the trees, the creaking of
the Whomping Willow's branches and the lazy splash of the Giant
Squid. He heard Hagrid as he blew his nose on his tablecloth sized
handkerchief. He heard muffled sobs and sniffles and the occasional
splash as a tear dripped from Dennis's face and landed on the chair
with a soft 'plink!' Harry forced his concentration back to
Kingsley.</p><p class="calibre8">"-and
we honour their sacrifice as we remember them and as we live our
lives fully, doing all the things that they died to give to us. They
did not die to see us mourn; they died to see us live. So let us
mourn for a time, so that they will not be forgotten and then live as
they would have us live. For in becoming the people that they wished
for us to become we do their memory the greatest honour.</p><p class="calibre8">"For
all those who fought at this battle, for all those who fought in this
war and the last and for all those who have laid down their lives so
that our children can grow up in a safe world, we live. And our lives
will stand as a monument to those who gave theirs."</p><p class="calibre8">Professor
McGonagall rose as Kingsley sat down, a scroll in her hands. For a
moment it looked absurdly as though she was about to commence the
sorting, a notion that was momentarily served when she unrolled it
and began reading, alphabetically, the names of those who had
perished in this, the last battle. One by one the closest kin of
those who had died defending Hogwarts and in defiance of Voldemort
came forward, most being supported by family members, to carve the
names on the memorial and as they did so a minutes silence was
observed for each of the fallen.</p><p class="calibre8">Creevey
wasn't very far down the list but when Colin's name was read out,
Dennis did not move. He remained shaking and pale perched on the seat
between Harry and George. Harry nudged him with his arm but this did
nothing to move Dennis who simply looked, petrified, at Harry. As
Harry gazed at the younger boy he didn't stop to think as he
tightened him arm around his shoulders and pulled Dennis with him as
he stood up. He had taken two steps when he realised that George had
risen also. The two older wizards flanked the younger, arms around
him as they walked slowly up to the monument.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
and George held Dennis upright as, through his tears, he carved
'Colin Creevey' on the monument, an everlasting reminder of the
enthusiastic young photographer. Harry stood there, his eyes reading
over the people who had been lost before he, George and Dennis turned
around and still holding one another up returned to their seats.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
watched as Andromeda Tonks, tears streaming down her face, stepped
quietly up to the monument and carved her daughter's name there.
And then McGonagall was reading out Remus John Lupin and Harry numbly
got to his feet once more. Somehow, he didn't know how, Harry found
his way to the monument once again, this time alone, and raising his
wand etched the name of the last of his parents' friends beneath
'Nymphadora Tonks Lupin', tears streaming down his cheeks. His
heart ached as he read the words he had carved and his mind flashed
back to Shell Cottage and Dobby, his name carved on a headstone
there.</p><p class="calibre8">Blindly
he made his way back to his seat and Professor McGonagall read on,
down her list. The names of people he'd never heard of etching
themselves on his memory as surely as they were being etched into the
stone. Miles Midgley … Rudolph Pemberton … Enid Plaskett … Mary
Romily … Eias Scriven …</p><p class="calibre8">Severus
Snape.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
rose wearily to his feet once more unable to know if he was capable
of going up there one more time. He gripped Ginny's hand and
squeezed it tightly before letting go and turning to make his way
back to the monument, his heart heavy, the beat pounding relentlessly
through his ears. His hands shook and he gripped the chair in front
of him. Suddenly a strong arm grasped his shoulders and he was pulled
into a rough hug. Ron guided him back up to the monument and held him
up while he carved the name of their once hated potions master into
the monument. Ron and Harry had not left the monument when Professor
McGonagall's clear voice shook as she read the final name on her
scroll.</p><p class="calibre8">Fred
Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">They
stayed, motionless at the monument as George rose slowly and stepped
out into the aisle. Harry could hear Mrs Weasley sobbing into her
husband's shoulder and see Ginny clinging to Hermione as George
made the short, solitary journey to the monument. A wand gripped
tightly in his white knuckled hand George stood before the monument,
his head bowed, fighting the tears that threatened to cascade down
his cheeks. He raised the wand, and Harry realised it was Fred's,
and began to shakily carve the name. He got only as far as the first
'e' when he faltered, nearly dropping the wand as he sank to his
knees. And then Ron was there, kneeling beside his older brother,
holding George's hand up, steady in his own, to finish carving
their brother's name. Then Harry and Ron wrapped their arms around
George, pulling him to his feet and the three walked together back to
their chairs.</p><p class="calibre8">The
sun was beginning to sink by the time the service finished, bathing
Hogwarts in a yellow light and softening the jagged edges still to be
repaired. People moved quietly across the lawns but Harry sat
silently in his chair looking at the monument, its carved list of
names making permanent the lives lost.</p><p class="calibre8">*******************</p><p class="calibre8">Dinner
in the Great Hall was a quiet affair that night. People seemed too
spent to expend much energy and despite their swelled ranks, as those
who had arrived from Hogsmeade and the Ministry remained for a meal,
it was quiet and somber.</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Weasley appeared to have dropped any pretense that she had been
holding onto the past few days and carried her grief openly on her
face rather than concealed behind carefully schooled expressions and
guarded features. She ate little and remained in her husband's
embrace as he ate one handed. George seemed to have regained his
composure somewhat although he was still quiet. The silence at the
end of the table where the Weasleys were sitting with Kingsley
Shacklebolt and several Aurors was broken by Percy.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
must say, Minister, that was a wonderful speech you gave this
afternoon," he said. "I too think the best memorial we can give
to those who are gone is to live, now that we can do so without fear.
I should be most happy to offer my services to help rebuild the
Ministry, and our world, in any way that you can make use of me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Blimey
Perce, was that a job application?" enquired George. "Fred would
be glad to know your ambition's not changed!" Ron snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Make
fun of him more like," he said. "Are you making a joke or a job
application Percy?" Percy looked at Ron thoughtfully, his chin on
his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I did submit my resignation after all. D'you think it still stands
if you deliver it to a sea urchin or should I put it in writing?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sea
urchin?" enquired Kingsley with a raised eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
I sort of ah, turned Minister Thicknesse into one right before the
Acromantulas broke through," Percy paused. "Only I am pretty sure
Fred hit him with something too after you three stunned his Death
Eater." Percy gestured to Harry, Ron and Hermione. "Who knows
what exactly the Minister looked like after that." Harry shook
involuntarily as images of the moment Fred had died swam through his
mind.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
all right mate?" Ron asked quietly. Harry shook his head wordlessly
and put down the goblet he had been holding before he spilled its
entire contents all over himself. He clenched his hands into fists in
an effort to stop the shaking and closed his eyes only to see streaks
of green light behind the lids. Green light streaking towards his
father, his mother, Cedric, Dumbledore, himself, missing Ginny by an
inch. He snapped his eyes open to find everyone watching him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
fine," he said but he knew that Bill did not believe him and he was
sure, from the look on her face, that Hermione shared his scepticism.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
what happened next," he heard George ask quietly and Ron gulped
audibly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
the Minister went down-" began Percy but George interrupted him.</p><p class="calibre8">"To
Fred," he said abruptly. "I want to know what happened to Fred."
There was a deathly silence. Finally Ron broke it.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
congratulated Percy on his joke," he said. "He was pretty chuffed
that Percy had managed a joke. It was a good gift to give him Perce,
at the – the end." Ron stumbled over the last few words and fell
silent.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
then what?" George's voice was harsh in the stillness. Mrs
Weasley reached a hand out to him but he shrugged away from her. "I
want to know what happened to Fred." Percy opened and closed his
mouth, Ron looked away before burying his face in his hands and
Hermione was white and clearly unable to speak.</p><p class="calibre8">"George,"
began Bill, "don't do this-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!
I wasn't there, I don't know what happened. I need to know,"
George pleaded. "I keep imagining all sorts of things and it's
all horrible and terrifying and every time I shut my eyes it's
something new, something different; and none of its real, because I
wasn't there. I wasn't there and he died without me." He
trailed off brokenly and the tears that filled his eyes threatened to
course down his cheeks at any moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was the walls," said Hermione softly. "The walls blew apart."</p><p class="calibre8">"He
was smiling," whispered Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
was laughing at me," said Percy.</p><p class="calibre8">As
he looked into George's pained eyes Harry watched his father, his
mother, Cedric, Sirius and Dumbledore all fall again.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
world fell apart," Harry said quietly to George. "That's what
happens next. The world falls apart."</p><p class="calibre8">No
one spoke for several minutes after that. Mrs Weasley's sobs were
the only noise to break the silence as the moment stretched on
forever. Eventually George spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
have to put it back together again. We have to pick up the pieces and
go on." Harry looked away; he didn't know how anymore, there were
so many pieces missing now.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everybody
leaves something behind," Mr Weasley said, as if he read Harry's
mind. "Soon the missing pieces will seem smaller, when we remember
and embrace the pieces that are left, the parts they left behind."
His words seemed to energise George who suddenly leapt from his
chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then
let's go and find some of Fred," he said. "Let's do something
he'd love. Everybody outside!" He grabbed Ginny's hand as he
strode towards the doors of the Great Hall, the rest of their
siblings, Harry, Hermione, Fleur and Lee Jordan hurried behind.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on Mum, Dad!" called Charlie. Mr Weasley seemed to make a decision
then and he urged his wife to her feet and they followed their family
out, the rest of the occupants of the Great Hall spilling after them.</p><p class="calibre8">George
was tearing down to the Quidditch pitch, Lee, Ron and Bill in his
wake. Harry watched as the four of them aimed their wands at the four
towers of the pitch and set off the first of the fireworks that had
been placed there the day before. The lawns were filled with people
making noises of awe and wonder at the spectacular display of
dazzling lights that began streaking across the heavens.</p><p class="calibre8">Enormous
fluorescent Catherine wheels, sparkling green and red dragons,
rockets trailing gold and silver stars and multi coloured
firecrackers erupted from the Quidditch pitch, hurling themselves
into the night sky and exploding over the lawns. Harry recognized the
same sorts he had seen during his fifth year but Fred and George had
obviously produced a few more varieties before hiding them and
escaping the school and Umbridge. He could also see enormous winged
horses that cycled the colours of the rainbow and soaring, sparkling
bullets that exploded in mid air to let out a shower of miniature
lions in red and gold. In the midst of the spectacular light show
Harry saw George release sparklers that wrote huge letters in the
sky.</p><p class="calibre8">'iFIREWORKS
FOR FRED/i', they spelled out over and over in red across
the night sky. And then another set were writing in gold, a message
that said it was time to live, to celebrate. The crowd gasped and
oooooooohed and ahhhhhhhed. The last shot of writing sparklers shot
out high into the night sky, surrounded by fire breathing dragons and
scores of miniature lions and they wrote in green across the sky,
'iTHANKS HARRY!/i'</p><p class="calibre8">As
the cheers erupted around him Harry felt his eyes fixed on the green
streaks of light as the sparklers wrote his name over and over again.
He felt the world receding, knew he had slumped to the ground, saw
Hermione look at him concernedly, Ron swimming into view, Ginny
hovering over him but then he could only see the green flashes, his
name written in green light and then the green light was shooting
towards his father, towards his mother, towards Cedric. The green
flashes threw Dumbledore off the tower, missed Ginny by an inch and
headed straight for him. Sound broke through his consciousness, they
were calling his name but he couldn't respond there was only the
green light flashing towards him over and over again.</p><p class="calibre8">He
wrenched his eyes shut but the green flashes of light did not go
away, they were streaking again towards his father, his mother,
Cedric, Dumbledore, himself, Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"NO!"
he pulled the rasping sound desperately from his throat. "Stop!"
He felt like he had to claw away from the green light and fighting
desperately with the images in his brain he felt strong hands on his
face. He forced his eyes open to look straight into Bill's. Harry
grasped Bill's forearms as if holding onto the one thing that would
stop him from drowning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Make
it stop," he forced out. "Make it stop." Bill looked him
steadily in the eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,
it's okay," he spoke softly, calmly. "I've got you. Hang on
to me. What do you need to stop? Tell me what you need to stop."
Harry felt his grip on Bill loosening.</p><p class="calibre8">"Flashing
– stop – lights –dying –," he breathed out before his
energy was spent and his eyes slid shut.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stay
with me Harry, I've got you," he heard the desperation in Bill's
voice and tightened his hands around the older man's forearms.
Hermione's shriek came piercing through his head as he fought the
panic and fear that was overtaking his body. Fighting to continue the
deep measured breaths needed to sustain life.</p><p class="calibre8">"Green
flashing lights! George, stop the green sparklers!" Harry could
hear scrambling and cursing around him and he willed his eyes open to
find Bill still holding his gaze, the green writing in the sky
framing Bill's head. Harry gripped Bill's arms tighter, his
fingernails digging into the other man's flesh, fighting down wave
after wave of rising panic, his breathing coming in short jerking
gasps.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
okay Harry. Stay with me. We're making it stop," Bill said.
"Breathe, Harry!" And Bill told him when to breathe in and when
to breathe out and Harry, looking into Bill's eyes, obeyed. He
focused on Bill, breathing in and out slowly and listening to his
voice softly telling him he was safe. As he looked into Bill's eyes
the green flashing faded away and the waves of panic subsided,
replaced by ghostlike glimpses of green on the edges of his vision
and a shaking he was unable to control.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
closed his eyes, still breathing slowly in and out and clutching
Bill's forearms as if they were his lifeline and did not protest
when Mrs Weasley insisted they take him home right that minute. Harry
didn't say anything when Bill and Ron hoisted him to his feet, half
carrying him back inside. He didn't argue with anyone when they
held out a Portkey for him to take and soon he felt a jerk behind his
navel that whisked him away from Hogwarts and death and green
flashing lights.</p>
