<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_32">*Chapter 31*: Chapter 31</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">31.
Past Pain</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry kicked at a
tin can that was rolling along the gutter as he ambled slowly up the
street. He was moving slower and slower with every step as if he
could stave off the inevitable by going so slowly he would never get
there. However, as he drew level with Number Four, Harry knew he had
only been putting off the confrontation he knew was coming. There was
no ignoring the incessant nudge his conscience was getting. The tin
can rolled away suddenly, making a hollow sound as it rolled halfway
into the road and stopped there, rolling back and forth as if pulled
by invisible strings on both sides, like two formless fairies were
playing tug-o-war.</p><p class="calibre8">He saw the curtain
in Number Four twitch as he started up the path to the front door. He
paused. Harry knew that if he did not do this now, now that he was
here, he would never do it. There was a definite appeal in that
course of action. He could turn around, go back to where he came from
and never return. Harry sighed heavily and trudged the last few steps
up onto the porch and rang the front doorbell.</p><p class="calibre8">He looked down at
the pristine doormat under his feet. The word WELCOME was plastered
across the bristly surface but Harry had never felt so unwelcome in
all his life. He studied the tiling on the doorstep. He'd been left
here. Hagrid had brought him here. Hagrid had taken him away from
here. He didn't want to come back here. The memories weren't
pleasant and of all the things the Death Eaters had done they
couldn't manage the one thing he would have gladly thanked them
for: annihilating this place.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry clutched the
plastic shopping bag in his left hand tighter and stared at a small,
circular hole drilled neatly into the door frame. No, not drilled,
nailed. It was a nail hole. After all this time there was still a
hole where a nail had forced it's way to the outside when Uncle
Vernon had nailed the door shut to stop his Hogwarts letter getting
in. Harry reached out to touch it but pulled his hand back abruptly
as the door jerked open. Aunt Petunia stood on the other side, her
face paler than he had ever seen it and her eyes darting about
frantically.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
doing?" she hissed at him. "Get inside before someone sees you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Is Dudley here?"
Harry asked instead.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Aunt
Petunia answered quickly. "Now get <em class="calibre9">off</em> that doorstep!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Can I see him?"
asked Harry shortly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What for?"</p><p class="calibre8">"He's my
cousin," said Harry plainly, "and I would like to see him."
Aunt Petunia huffed and turned towards the interior of the house.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dudders!" she
called sweetly, because the door was still open and her voice could
be heard by Mrs Pennington who was sitting in her lounge room at
Number Two, with her head out the window. "You have a visitor!"
Harry heard Dudley grumble and then a noise like a herd of wildebeest
as Dudley thumped out of his bedroom and along the upstairs corridor.
Footsteps thudded like drum beats, punctuating his every word as he
plodded down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Dudley
called. "What is it now, woman?" Harry stifled a smirk. Aunt
Petunia pressed her lips into a line so thin her bloodless lips
vanished entirely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry is here,"
she hissed out of the corner of her mouth, looking extremely
unladylike. Dudley nearly tripped as he ran down the remaining stairs
and pushed his mother aside as he reached the doorway. He reached out
a beefy arm and pulled Harry inside into a brief one-armed hug. Harry
stood on the hall runner as stiff as a board and in more than a
little shock at Dudley's actions.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been
asking Deddie about you for months!" he exclaimed, carelessly
banging the door shut, making Aunt Petunia wince.</p><p class="calibre8">"Deddie?" asked
Harry, bemused.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," shrugged
Dudley. "Dedalus is a bit … well … it's a bit of an odd
name."</p><p class="calibre8">"I just wanted to
come and let you know that … it's finished," said Harry. "But
yeah, you know that, huh, seeing as you're back here and … not in
hiding any more." Dudley nodded vigorously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Was a right
creepy house we were in, full of other magical refugees and that,"
said Dudley. "Reckon it had rooms without doors and doors without
rooms."</p><p class="calibre8">"Completely
unnatural," muttered Aunt Petunia.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh come on you
liked that Chumley woman," said Dudley rolling his eyes. Harry
stiffened at the way Dudley so casually threw the name out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well she was
<em class="calibre9">normal</em> wasn't she," sniffed Aunt Petunia. "Nothing
hocus-pocus about her."</p><p class="calibre8">"Good kids
though," said Dudley, "although that older one was stuck up a
bit." Harry turned away so Dudley couldn't see his smirk. His
eyes fell on a photograph sitting on the tiny hall table. It was one
he had never seen before. He was used to pictures of the fat, blond
baby in bobbled hats and garish jumpers but this one was of two
little girls. It was black and white, cracked and yellowing. The
older child was unmistakably Aunt Petunia with the same horsey face,
all angles. The chubby baby sitting next to her had wispy curls on
her head and big eyes that matched her laughing smile as she clutched
a tiny teddy bear. Harry reached out a hand to the photograph and
jumped, snatching his hand back as if scalded when Aunt Petunia
spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"We found that in
the house," she said quietly. Harry looked up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Deddie's really
smart," chimed in Dudley. "He made it so we could see it. Dad
didn't come of course, said it was all a bunch of hokey-pokey, but
me and Mum went."</p><p class="calibre8">"Went where?"
asked Harry in a strangled voice, staring at the picture.</p><p class="calibre8">"That house where
your mum and dad got … er, where you lived as a baby," stammered
Dudley.</p><p class="calibre8">"When did you go
there?" Harry asked in a hollow voice as he stared at the baby
picture of his mother in a gilt frame on his aunt's hall table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh … maybe,
about six weeks ago," said Dudley, he looked as if he were thinking
hard. Harry wondered if Dudley was about to strain himself.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" blurted
Harry. He was reeling and didn't know what to make of this sort of
information and he wanted so badly to pick that photograph up and
leave.</p><p class="calibre8">"I expect because
Dudley wouldn't leave him alone," said Aunt Petunia in a tight
voice. "Unnatural fascination …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I wanted to know
what happened," said Dudley. He shoved his hands in his pockets and
shuffled his feet nervously. "Gilbert, that's the little Chumley
kid, good kid he is, he reckoned you was a hero told me a bunch of
stories and … have you <em class="calibre9">been</em> there?" Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"At Christmas,"
he whispered in a strangled tone.</p><p class="calibre8">"There was a
drawer," said Dudley, glancing at his mother. "It was hanging
open and I could see this sort of yellowy square hanging out of it.
It was an envelope and it had that photo in it." Dudley indicated
the picture on the hall table.</p><p class="calibre8">"So you took it?"
asked Harry coldly, turning on Aunt Petunia suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I-I didn't have
any of her any more," Aunt Petunia stammered. "I burnt them all."
Harry glared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"That house is <em class="calibre9">not</em>
yours and it's your own fault if you burnt them," he said slowly
and deliberately. "You had no right to even go there." Aunt
Petunia refused to look at him and fixed her eyes on a picture of
Dudley in his Smeltings uniform hanging on the wall behind his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," said
Dudley quietly. Harry turned to look at him. Dudley was holding a
large, thick parchment envelope in his hand. The door to the cupboard
under the stairs was swinging gently. Harry hadn't even seen him go
in there. Dudley extended the parchment envelope to Harry, who took
it with a shaking hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's another
one in there," he said. Harry wrestled with his plastic shopping
bag to peer inside the envelope. A bundle of photographs, creased and
yellow with age, nestled in the corner of the envelope. Harry took a
deep breath and closed it again before putting the envelope in his
shopping bag. He wasn't going to look at them there, standing
inhospitably in the hallway with Aunt Petunia looking as though she'd
rather swallow a whole lemon and Dudley looking … friendly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks," he
murmured, looking for a way out, wishing that he'd never come;
while at the same time almost feeling the envelope burning a hole
through the shopping bag and knowing it held some great treasure he
knew he wanted more than anything.</p><p class="calibre8">"Vernon will be
home any minute," Aunt Petunia said suddenly. She wanted him to
leave and the feeling was mutual so Harry took a step back towards
the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I, erm, thank
you," he said stiffly. "I'll um, if I … ah when I …"</p><p class="calibre8">"It was good to
see you, Harry," said Dudley quietly. "Deddie reckons you've
got lots to keep you busy and all, so um if you get the chance to
send a letter or two ... well I'll be at Police College but Mum'll
be able to send 'em on."</p><p class="calibre8">"Police College?"
asked Harry, one eyebrow raised. Dudley nodded enthusiastically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I got to talking
to Deddie and some fellow he brought around sometimes," he said
animatedly. "Reckon he was some sort of Law Enforcement. Really
helped me sort out what I want to do with my life, you know. I sat
the entrance exam in July, start next week up at Hendon. I'm going
to be a <em class="calibre9">Bobbie</em>, Harry!" Dudley seemed to be bouncing on his
toes excitedly. Harry stared at him for a moment before nodding his
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
congratulations then, Dudley," he said. "I um … had better get
going. Um, thanks."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh hey, Harry,"
Dudley said as he reached to open the door, "d'you reckon you
could send some of those flavour beans, erm, next time you get a
chance? Absolutely brilliant those are. I mean, chocolate frogs are
nice and all but the jumping is a little creepy." Harry nodded
dumbly as he stepped onto the porch.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
later then," he said, standing on the doormat. Harry could see
Uncle Vernon's car turning into the street. It was a new car,
probably a company car, but it was immensely shiny and Harry could
see his Uncle's massive bulk taking up space behind the wheel. No
one else was out on Privet Drive, the sun was sinking and it was
getting cold.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah I'll send
you a postcard from Hendon, if I can figure out how to get me hands
on an Owl!" said Dudley cheerfully. Harry looked past him to Aunt
Petunia and the photo on the little hall table and made a decision.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks Big D,"
Harry smiled before throwing a cheeky grin at his Aunt and turning on
the spot, Disapparating just as Uncle Vernon pulled into the
driveway. Harry arrived at the Burrow chuckling and strolled up to
the back door. He was just about to open it when someone inside
yanked it open and glared at him fiercely. Harry's smile faltered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello Bill," he
said warily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where have you
<em class="calibre9">been</em>?" questioned Bill. "It's been hours since we were
at the Ministry!" Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I went out," he
said evasively. Bill eyed him suspiciously but kept silent. He
stepped back so that Harry could come inside. Harry edged inside
warily and Bill shut the door behind him. The kitchen was warm and
smelled inviting.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" cried
Molly from where she was stirring something on the stove. She hurried
over and grasped his arms, looking intently into his eyes. "Are you
all right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I'm fine,"
answered Harry, drawing his brows together.</p><p class="calibre8">"When you didn't
turn up this afternoon, Andromeda fire-called," Molly said. "Ron
and Arthur have gone to look for you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll just send
Dad and Ron a Patronus, let them know you came home," said Bill.
Harry saw that Bill's hands were shaking as he gripped the back of
a chair. "We've been worried. I know it didn't go very well
this morning but-"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's an
understatement," muttered Harry putting his plastic shopping bag on
the table and running a hand through his hair. He turned to see an
indistinct silvery shape go sailing through the kitchen wall. "They
might not be able to take Teddy today but the Wizengamot didn't
seem all that eager to make it permanent."</p><p class="calibre8">"It was only ever
going to be an interim order," said Bill helplessly. "The fight's
not over and it won't be for months."</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone has to
talk some sense into this Brown character," said Harry. "You're
not dangerous and Teddy's not dangerous. You're not even
werewolves!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," said
Bill gripping his shoulder. "We will win this fight; we just can't
win it today."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why not?"
demanded Harry. "It seems pretty straightforward to me. I mean,
Kingsley's the Minister, why can't he just … tell them?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That would be
dictating just like … before," answered Bill. He stuffed his
hands in his pockets and stared out the window. "Just like
Voldemort."</p><p class="calibre8">"Most of the
Wizengamot seemed to think it was a good idea to tighten controls,"
said Harry bitterly.</p><p class="calibre8">"We can turn them
around, Harry," said Bill urgently. He spun around to face Harry.
"With proper research and a well-prepared case we can make this
resolution permanent and watertight. We can't give up."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you really
think we can?" asked Harry. "Make it permanent, I mean? Make it
so you are safe; so Teddy is safe?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I think we can,"
answered Bill. "We have to."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
they didn't listen to you," huffed Molly banging a cauldron onto
the stove forcefully. "You're Harry Potter!" Harry grimaced and
Molly shot a jet of water from her wand into the pot. She might have
put a bit too much power behind it because the water splashed out of
the pot and sizzled on the flames underneath the cauldron. Bill
chuckled softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd better get
home to Fleur. Everything all right then, Harry?" asked Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah I just, I
had to go somewhere," answered Harry avoiding Bill's gaze. Harry
stared at the plastic shopping bag. The parchment envelope was
inside. His fingers itched to open it but he didn't want to do it
here; it needed to be somewhere private. He had no idea what or who
was in those photographs or even if they <em class="calibre9">were</em> all photographs.
He didn't have a chance to excuse himself to go and look at it
because Ron and Arthur burst through the door at that moment, Ron
skidding hurriedly to a stop in front of Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where have you
been, you git?" Ron shouted at him. "I thought you were going to
see Teddy? Don't you <em class="calibre9">ever</em> make me have to tell Ginny you're
missing! You can't go wandering off like that! People want a piece
of you. I'm surprised you don't have bodyguards! If you're
going to go wandering off all the time maybe you need a minder!"
Harry took a step back as Arthur put a calming hand on Ron's arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just went
shopping," Harry said. "I needed to go shopping."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't see
you in Diagon Alley," said Ron suspiciously.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, Muggle
shopping," explained Harry patiently. He stifled a chuckle as he
saw Arthur prick up his ears. "I told Ginny I'd bring back a
Monopoly set for our Muggle Studies assignment. I'm also supposed
to bring her chocolate. Not only do I not know why she will need it
next week, but Muggle chocolate is so confusing. I couldn't just
buy a simple chocolate frog; no they had about four different kinds
of chocolate frog to choose from! How am I supposed to know which
ones she'd like?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't get
her chocolate frogs!" exclaimed Ron, poking at the plastic bag. He
jumped when it crackled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why not? She
likes chocolate frogs," said Harry extracting the Monopoly game
from the shopping bag, grateful that everyone had forgotten to ask
him where he'd been all afternoon. "You're just jealous because
she has more cards than you now."</p><p class="calibre8">"She can't count
yours," said Ron, rolling his eyes dramatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I gave them to
her," argued Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only so she could
say she had more than me!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Boys," said
Molly mildly, elbowing Ron aside so she could set some plates on the
table. They settled with a quiet clank as she waved her wand to
levitate the forks over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Anyway, you can't
give her chocolate frogs," said Ron with an air of finality as he
turned the Monopoly box over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Definitely not,"
said Bill. He winked at Ron. "I'd better be off then. See you all
later. I'll be in touch, Harry." Bill left and Harry turned to
Ron exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Say what you
like," he said. "I'll get some chocolate frogs in the morning
before I go back. We have lost all the Agrippa cards and the one of
that wizard who invented Drooble's. Maybe we can replace them."
Ron shook his head and muttered something that sounded like 'no
clue'.</p><p class="calibre8">After they had
eaten, Harry left the Monopoly set with Ron and Arthur who were
determined to figure the game out. Molly shook her head indulgently
at them and Harry excused himself to borrow Pigwidgeon. After he sent
Ginny a note explaining the situation and letting her know he
wouldn't be back until the next day, he went to visit Teddy.
Andromeda didn't seem at all displeased at the temporary nature of
the orders Kingsley had secured that morning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh there's
still a way to go," she said as she bustled about the kitchen while
Harry bounced Teddy on his lap and pulled faces at the baby to make
him laugh. "They won't be able to just barge in and take him
though. You don't know how much that relieves my mind." Teddy
squealed and grabbed at Harry's nose. Harry gave him a small rubber
duck as a distraction.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well the fight's
not over," he said, looking up at Andromeda. "I'm not stopping
until it is and his future will be secure." Andromeda smiled at him
fondly before breaking out into peals of laughter. Harry looked down
at Teddy who had managed to transform his nose into a replica of the
bill on the yellow rubber duck that was now lying on the floor. Teddy
was straining to get to the toy, his hair sticking up in black spiky
tufts and his face gradually going yellow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hufflepuff, huh?"
Harry asked his godson as he bent down to retrieve the duck. "Well,
all right then. If you aren't going to be a Gryffindor like your
dad, the least you can do is be a 'Puff like your mum." Teddy
stopped trying to twist to the floor and looked up at Harry with eyes
that resembled Tonks's and a duck's bill for a nose. Harry stayed
absolutely still as Teddy stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"She used to do
that all the time," he whispered to Teddy eventually. "Ginny used
to laugh because she could turn it into a pig's snout as well. I
think the pig snout looks better with pink hair. You've got her
eyes you know." Harry's breath caught in his throat and he heard
Andromeda sniff but he couldn't take his eyes away from Teddy's
gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gah," said
Teddy solemnly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've got my
mum's eyes," Harry continued as the duck's bill faded and
Teddy's own nose reappeared. Harry ran a hand through Teddy's
soft hair. "And my dad's hair, but you've definitely got your
mum's hair and her nose." Teddy reached a pudgy hand up to grab
at Harry's cheek where a lone tear rolled down.</p><p class="calibre8">"Buh," said
Teddy.</p><p class="calibre8">"No one told me,
you know," said Harry. "I didn't know until I was … at
Hogwarts. I didn't know I had my mum's eyes and my dad's hair.
I got my knobbly knees from him, too. No one told me." Harry paused
and traced Teddy's face tenderly. Teddy grabbed at his finger.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nuhmg,"
murmured Teddy and tried to chew on Harry's finger.</p><p class="calibre8">"You look just
like her," Harry murmured. "She had a heart-shaped face, just
like you, and she liked to turn her hair pink. But I hope you get
your dad's sense of balance because hers was terrible, always
tripping over things. She was brilliant on a broomstick, though. One
day, I'll teach you how to fly. Your dad was a great teacher. I
really miss them." Harry didn't try to stop the tears that began
to stream down his face. Teddy reached up to catch the tears that
dripped from the end of Harry's nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry …" said
Andromeda gently. Harry looked up at her. Her eyes were red rimmed
but she was smiling at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry, I
just …" he trailed off and looked down at Teddy who was still
gazing up at him intently. Andromeda reached out and smoothed Harry's
hair before patting his cheek gently the way Molly often did.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's all
right, Harry," she said. "Don't ever stop telling Teddy about
them. He's so much like his mother, some days it hurts just to look
at him. But he's got his father's determination. They made the
right choice when they chose you to be his godfather." Andromeda
dropped her hand to stroke Teddy's cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I never knew how
much he looked like Tonks before," said Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's because
he always tries to look like you," murmured Andromeda as she moved
away to set out the tea things. "He is so much like his mother."
Harry stared for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"He is, isn't
he?" he said suddenly. "He's like his <em class="calibre9">mother</em>."
Andromeda looked at him curiously as she took two teacups out of a
cupboard in the corner.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why do you sound
excited about that?" she asked. Harry smiled at Teddy and tickled
his tummy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because if we
argue this thing right, that could make all the difference," he
said. "All your dad gave you was your determination, hey little
guy?" Andromeda stood motionless in front of the cupboard.</p><p class="calibre8">"You could be
right, Harry," was all she said, but her eyes sparkled with what
Harry decided to call hope; and Teddy squealed and laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where did you go
this afternoon?" asked Ron later that night as the two of them lay
in bed. Harry turned his head to face Ron. The full moon bathed the
world in dim light which poured between the curtains and into the
room. Ron was watching Harry closely.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told you,
Muggle shopping," Harry answered, hoping he sounded casual and not
like his heart was beating faster than the Hogwarts Express. Ron
raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then why are you
more jittery than Pig?" he asked Harry. "What are you hiding?"
Harry turned his face back to the ceiling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing," he
replied thinking of the thick parchment envelope at the bottom of his
bag. He kept wondering if he should just look at its contents but he
hadn't been able to bring himself to do it. He'd never had
something so important and so precious that he was so utterly
terrified of.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well if you won't
tell me, make sure you tell Ginny," grunted Ron. Harry heard the
bedcovers rustle as Ron turned over. He lay in the dim light from the
full moon thinking about the werewolf legislation, Teddy, and the
envelope in his bag. Ron had unwittingly hit on the answer to Harry's
dilemma over the mysterious envelope – Harry needed to share it
with Ginny; he couldn't open it until she was with him in case …
in case he needed her. He suddenly ached to be near her, morning
couldn't come fast enough.</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry arrived back
at Hogwarts late on Sunday afternoon to find Dean and Seamus sitting
idly on the steps of the Entrance Hall. There was a sprinkling of
students on the lawn and Neville was muttering to himself as he
walked along the path towards them. He was covered in dirt and
clutched a tattered book that he was feverishly flipping through.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" called
Seamus. Harry raised a hand in greeting and jogged up the steps to
join them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello," he
said, flopping down beside Dean, dropping his bags carelessly on the
top step.</p><p class="calibre8">"How is it on the
outside?" asked Dean, idly scraping at the gaps in the stone steps.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron says hello,"
said Harry, watching Dean's fingers go back and forth, digging a
small sharp pebble into the groove between two stones. "What are
you doing?" Dean looked up, startled. His eyes drifted back down to
the gritty dust now littering the step. He brushed it away hurriedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"There was this
dark spot … in the grout," said Dean shakily. "I th-think it
was blood and I was getting rid of it." No one said anything as
Neville sank onto the steps beside them.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry watched a
group of first years running through the hedges on the edge of the
lawn and a small clutch of second years, probably coming back from
the Quidditch pitch with their broomsticks. The sun beat down on the
children as they played, clouds scudding across the deep expanse of
blue.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a great
day," said Neville eventually. "It'll be getting cold soon."</p><p class="calibre8">"We weren't
allowed outside last year," said Seamus softly. "Not really.
Could go to the courtyards and the greenhouses but not really much
place else. Stopped the greenhouse visits too eventually."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's good they
can play outside," said Neville. Dean suddenly swiped at the dust
he'd created on the step, sending it fluttering into the air where
it twirled around, some of it falling back to the steps and the rest
blown away on the wind.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you think
we'll ever be free of it?" asked Seamus. "D'you think it'll
ever go away?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It'll fade,"
said Neville. "Scars fade."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not all of them,"
said Harry distantly drawing his knees up to his chest and staring
out towards the Forbidden Forest. A heavy silence fell over the
group. It wasn't oppressive, but it lingered, teasing them and
daring them to try and chase it away. Harry took a deep breath and
exhaled slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, where's
Luna then?" asked Seamus suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's helping
Audrey avoid you, you great prat," grinned Neville. "Honestly I
haven't seen anyone try and avoid you so much since Lavender after
the Yule Ball!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Lavender avoiding
you, that's serious mate," chortled Dean. "Not many blokes she
willingly avoids."</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up," said
Seamus giving him a shove. Dean nearly fell off the step he was
perched on.</p><p class="calibre8">"She and Parvati
have opened a shop," said Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"What sort of
shop?" asked Dean, kicking Seamus's shoe with his foot as he
straightened himself on the step.</p><p class="calibre8">"I dunno,"
shrugged Harry. "Ron's been in. I didn't have time to go in,
but it looked like Trelwaney's wardrobe had thrown up in the
window."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a
Divination shop," said Neville. "They're selling things for
Divination and if you want, they'll do a reading."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, well,"
said Seamus, grinning. "Neville knows all about it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hannah sent me an
Owl," said Neville absently, still flipping through his book. Dean
sat up abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Does Luna know
you're getting Owls from some other girl?" he demanded.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Neville
asked, startled as he dropped his book. "Hannah's my friend."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes, very
friendly," smirked Seamus and Neville blushed violently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna understands
about Hannah," Neville said, bending to pick up his book. "Luna
and I understand each other just fine thank you. She's not the sort
to be worried because I am <em class="calibre9">friends</em> with someone."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's deep,
mate," said Seamus, getting to his feet and dusting off the seat of
his trousers. "I'm going to see Miss Audrey and see if I can't
get her to ah … study with me tonight." He smirked at Neville
again and swaggered off to a group of girls a short distance away,
strolling across the grounds.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lavender's not
doing well, is she?" asked Neville as they watched Seamus approach
Audrey.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, she's not
really," replied Harry as Audrey turned her back on Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
Lavender's problem?" enquired Dean. Audrey began to walk away.
Seamus trotted after her.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry briefly
explained what he knew as Seamus tried to grasp Audrey's arm and
tripped over something, perhaps his own two feet, and went sprawling,
pulling Audrey down with him. Dean narrowed his eyes in confusion at
Harry's words.</p><p class="calibre8">"But she was all
right," he insisted. Seamus lay sprawled on the grass while Audrey
stood over him and berated him – she was wagging a finger at him
and all.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know she was,"
replied Harry, trying not to smirk as Audrey turned her back on
Seamus and stalked away. "Is it any wonder she has nightmares
though?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I have
nightmares," said Neville quietly. The three of them watched as
Seamus stomped back across the grounds towards them.</p><p class="calibre8">"I reckon we all
have nightmares," Dean acknowledged. Seamus scowled at him as he
threw himself on the steps.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">She's </em>a
bloody nightmare," he grumbled. "Honestly."</p><p class="calibre8">"You giving up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nope."</p><p class="calibre8">**************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was distracted
and pensive all evening. The Monopoly set had been set up in front of
the Gryffindor common room fire and the seventh years crowded around
while Ginny read out the instructions. She'd greeted Harry
enthusiastically earlier but they had been interrupted by several
second years who had started a fight on the staircase. By the time
Harry and Hermione had sent the Slytherin students to Professor
Slughorn, the Gryffindors to Professor Crockwell, and the Hufflepuffs
caught in the crossfire to the Hospital Wing it was time to eat.
Harry saw Ginny look at him concernedly several times during the meal
but he squeezed her hand and tried to smile reassuringly. His mind
was racing several directions at once as he mechanically chewed his
food.</p><p class="calibre8">He had enjoyed the
freedom that going home had provided and revelled in the chance to
see Ron and Teddy, but now that he was back at Hogwarts he had
started to fret. Was Teddy all right? Had Bill and Fleur been further
harassed? How was Lavender? He also felt mildly guilty that he'd
not worried about Ginny while he'd been away. Hermione had also
noticed his pensive mood and while Neville and Seamus fought over who
would get to be the top hat she caught his eye and motioned to a
small table under a window. Harry glanced at Ginny who was laughing
at Dean and trying to hold the boot out of his reach.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you going to
play, Harry?" asked Neville. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll give it a
miss," he said quietly, looking again at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll be the
banker," said Ginny surrendering the boot token. Dean raised it
above his head dramatically in mock triumph. Ginny looked at Harry
for a moment before nodding her head at Hermione who had moved to the
small table under the window. Harry raised his eyebrows at her but
Ginny just smiled and tilted her head at Hermione before handing the
instructions to Neville and began counting out the paper money.</p><p class="calibre8">"So you throw the
dice and then you move around the board and they give you money just
for going around it?" asked Dennis Creevey who had been watching
the older students with interest. "You do all this stuff along the
way?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, seems like
it," answered Neville absently, staring at the instructions in his
hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't get
it," said Seamus sighing heavily. "Why is this a wheelbarrow?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just a
token, Seamus," answered Dean. "Here, I'll show you. We used to
have monopoly tournaments when I was a kid; it's my mum's
favourite game." Dean launched into an explanation of Chance cards
and the Community Chest. Harry quietly got up from his chair and
joined Hermione at the window. He smiled slightly as he heard Dean
exclaim exasperatedly that poking the 'No Parking' car with a
wand wasn't going to make it go because it wasn't a magical board
game.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione got
straight to the point.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pig arrived this
afternoon while we were in the library," she said and looked at
Harry expectantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You guys should
use Liberty sometimes," Harry said. "Pig will get worn out if you
send him back and forth so much." Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was addressed
to Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," said Harry
flatly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well Ron did send
me- er … something also, but-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Bit romantic is
he?" Harry asked, smirking and trying to deflect the attention from
himself. Hermione arched an eyebrow at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"As a matter of
fact, yes," she said primly and folded her hands on the table in
front of her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"
deadpanned Harry. "I was being facetious."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, Ron's very
romantic," said Hermione. "He sends me little notes and
chocolates sometimes and he remembers to put the toothpaste in with
it. Sometimes he sends me poetry. I mean I know he didn't write it,
but that doesn't matter, it's the thought that counts."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron sends you
poetry?</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes," nodded
Hermione leaning forward slightly, an unholy gleam in her eyes. "And
… he knows just how to hold my hand so he doesn't squeeze it too
tight and how I like him to run his fingers up my arm and he's got
this thing he does where he draws little circles on my back, just up
under my shirt. He's got very talented hands actually, the other
day he worked out how to undo the clasp on my robes with just one
hand while the other one was-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop!" yelped
Harry. Hermione sat back and smirked at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I will," she
said, "if you tell me what happened this weekend that made Ron tell
Ginny to look after you." Harry looked up at her solemnly. He let
out a heavy sigh and stared out the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's going to
look after Ron?" he muttered under his breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's wrong
with Ron?" asked Hermione. Harry looked at her; she was chewing her
bottom lip and staring at him worriedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing," said
Harry. He was not convincing. Hermione tilted her head and shook it
exasperatedly. They watched each other for a moment before Harry
dropped his head into his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just that
… he," Harry sighed and decided to blurt everything out. "He's
trying to look after everyone. George disappeared the whole weekend.
Molly doesn't even know Ron hasn't seen him since Friday lunch
time."</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"
exclaimed Hermione. "Did you look for him?" Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Apparently he
does it a lot. Ron hides it from their parents so they don't worry
about him," replied Harry. "Between Hannah, Rosmerta and
Aberforth, Ron usually knows where he's at."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's awful,"
gasped Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's how it
is," said Harry. "I don't think Ron realises it's not normal
anymore. Penelope dumped Percy. I just … it's sort of … well I
don't know why he's worrying about looking after me!" Hermione
reached across the table and squeezed Harry's hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's always
worried about you," said Hermione softly. "He's always looked
after you. You being here is tearing him apart as much as Ginny being
here is. You saw him that first day – trying to worry about
everyone at once."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, worrying
about George and Ginny," sighed Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"And you," added
Hermione softly. "He tore Ginny apart for worrying you. So what
made him Owl her?" Harry stared out the window, played with a loose
thread on the hem of his shirt and inspected the initials etched on
the table. He didn't even understand his own reluctance to explain
how he'd spent his weekend. He needed Hermione's help and he knew
it but she'd been so happy going back to school, immersing herself
in study and books, involving her in another fight seemed cruel.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey look Hermione
I think Sirius got happy with a penknife here," he said, tracing an
ornate SB that had been etched into the table top. Hermione shook her
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"That was Cormac
McClaggen with a wand in his fifth year when he fancied Susan Bones,"
she grinned. "Sirius carved this over here." She pointed to a
neat box in the corner near the wall. Inside the box a love heart
read SB 4 AP.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wonder who AP
was?" mused Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who knows?"
said Hermione. "Who knows who he or she was or why you are so
gloomy."</p><p class="calibre8">"He or she?"
Harry raised an eyebrow. Hermione shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop avoiding the
question, Harry."</p><p class="calibre8">"Lavender Brown's
uncle wants to tighten werewolf controls," said Harry eventually.
"I spent Saturday morning at the Ministry listening to a bunch of
pompous gits argue whether or not people who have had contact with a
werewolf are a danger to themselves and others."</p><p class="calibre8">"No," gasped
Hermione. Harry nodded grimly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lavender's
having nightmares or flashbacks or something," he said. "She
barely leaves the house. Her uncle seems to think if he locks up
anyone who has even <em class="calibre9">looked</em> at a werewolf she'll get better."</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you
exaggerating, Harry?" Hermione asked, eyebrows raised. He looked at
her sheepishly. "Tell me exactly who this fellow wants to lock up."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, people
who've had contact with a werewolf," he began.</p><p class="calibre8">"Surely not,"
scowled Hermione. "That's going to be practically the entire
magical population."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … I didn't
really understand everything he said -"</p><p class="calibre8">"Obviously,"
said Hermione dryly. Harry narrowed his eyes at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"But I <em class="calibre9">think</em>
it's certain kinds of contact," he said. "He had a big long
list with about fifty different points."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't
understand," Hermione said thoughtfully. "Lavender wasn't
bitten by a transformed werewolf. It was close to the full moon,
sure, but it was the same as Bill …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes and they are
going after Bill as well," said Harry bitterly. Hermione looked up
sharply.</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy?" she
questioned softly. Harry nodded. "Oh Harry."</p><p class="calibre8">"You have got to
help me, Hermione," Harry said, a little desperately. "I thought
of something but I don't know if it's good enough and I can't
fight this Brown guy on his level. I think he's some sort of fancy
lawyer or something. He used a whole bunch of big words I don't
even know the meaning of and they had like six blokes with stacks of
parchments.</p><p class="calibre8">"They want to put
Teddy in a cage every full moon—in some sort of refuge thing to
make sure he doesn't hurt anyone. How will they look after him?
What happens if he cries? He's just a baby, Hermione! He doesn't
even have any teeth yet – although they are about to come through.
He tried to bite my finger off yesterday and then he just looked up
at me all innocent; looked just like Tonks did when she was trying to
pretend she didn't just knock over a vase. He looks so much like
her, Hermione."</p><p class="calibre8">"They aren't
going to are they?" Hermione asked urgently as she leaned forward,
her voice lowered. "Lock him up?" Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kingsley came
back from Spain," Harry started. "He managed to calm the
Wizengamot down and there are interim orders and someone's supposed
to do further research. But … Hermione, they are all petrified.
They <em class="calibre9">want</em> to pass the laws. Not just for werewolves but for
anyone who's been attacked, whether it was a transformed werewolf
or not, and for anyone who's parents are a werewolf … or were."</p><p class="calibre8">"But … wouldn't
that include Lavender as well?" asked Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably,"
shrugged Harry. "I wasn't really concerned about her, I was more
worried about the fact that they want to lock my godson up in a <em class="calibre9">cage</em>,
Hermione!" His raised voice drew a few concerned looks from the
rest of the Gryffindors in the room. Ginny was watching him closely
and he gave her a tight smile. She returned his look with one that
said she was thinking of things to do to him later. Harry let his mid
wander for just a moment as he watched Ginny methodically count out
some paper notes to give to Seamus who did a little victory dance
under the nose of a scowling Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"What does
Lavender think?" Hermione was saying when he dragged his mind back
to the more pressing issue of werewolf legislation.</p><p class="calibre8">"She doesn't
think anything," he shrugged. "I didn't speak to her."
Hermione let out an exasperated huff.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well that just
means you don't know what she thinks, not that she doesn't think
anything," Hermione rolled her eyes at him. "First thing we need
to do, then, is talk to Lavender."</p><p class="calibre8">"We?" asked
Harry, raising an eyebrow and smirking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course 'we',
Harry," said Hermione softly, "it'll always be 'we'."
Harry smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks Hermione,"
he said. He was glad she seemed satisfied he had unburdened
everything that had been bothering him. He had no desire to revisit
his trip to Privet Drive, revealing the parchment envelope at the
bottom of his bag. He was practically terrified of it by now. The
longer he put it off the more he dreaded looking inside. He also knew
that it was best not to tell Hermione about it. She would nag and nag
him until he opened it and faced whatever was in there; and as far as
Harry was concerned, Hermione was not equipped to help him face it.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what happens
next?" Hermione asked him expectantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"They've
scheduled a proper hearing or whatever they call it for two week's
time," answered Harry. "Brown wants something in place by the
next full moon."</p><p class="calibre8">"Two weeks doesn't
give us a lot of time," mused Hermione. She pulled a planner out of
her bag and fished around for a quill. Flipping through the pages she
began muttering about study schedules and getting permission to leave
the grounds.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione?"
Harry asked tentatively. She nodded absently. "I wanted to ask you,
is being a werewolf hereditary?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Hermione
shook her head. "It's like a virus or an infection. You have to
be bitten – by an actual transformed werewolf."</p><p class="calibre8">"So there is no
way Teddy is genetically a werewolf?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said
Hermione. "I thought you'd read <em class="calibre9">Fantastic Beasts and Where to
Find Them</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's what I
thought," Harry leaned forward. "Teddy looks just like <em class="calibre9">his
mother</em>. He has her eyes and her face and he's a metamorphmagus,
not a werewolf. But even if he didn't look like her, he can't be
a werewolf can he?" Hermione narrowed her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why would anyone
need to lock up a child who isn't actually a werewolf?" she said
thoughtfully before leaping out of her seat. "I need to go to the
library. I'll see you later." Harry shook his head and smiled as
he watched her go.</p><p class="calibre8">The Monopoly game
was still going. Harry watched as Neville scowled while handing over
what looked like all the cash he had. Dean was grinning like a
Cheshire cat and Harry had no doubt he owned all the properties that
had red hotels on them. Harry turned his attention to the tabletop in
front of him. Years of initials and carved swirls moved across the
scarred wooden surface. He traced the SB initials Hermione had
pointed out, realising that they were in Sirius's handwriting. He
searched the table carefully and smiled when he saw, etched carefully
into one corner <em class="calibre9">'RW +HG'</em>. It looked like a very fresh
etching. He was still searching the table when a cry went up from the
table in front of the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not fair,"
Neville said plaintively. "You're Muggle-born. I bet you can play
this in your sleep!" Dean was still grinning at Neville as Neville
handed over what looked like every Title Deed he had.</p><p class="calibre8">"You may as well
just have it all! I can never pay you that rent!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you
Neville," crowed Dean, organising his new properties meticulously.
Ginny handed Neville the money tray.</p><p class="calibre8">"Here, you be the
Banker, Neville," she said. Neville started to protest but then his
eyes flicked to Harry and he took the tray carefully. Ginny unwound
herself from the chair she had been curled up in and padded her way
across the room to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where did
Hermione go?" she asked softly as she stood in front of him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Library,"
answered Harry, "had to look something up." Ginny snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you think we
can find something better to do?" she asked him with a grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I –
there's… I need to show you something … upstairs-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh really?"
Ginny raised her eyebrows suggestively and then winked at him. Harry
blushed and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"One track mind,
you have," he muttered as he pushed himself out of the seat. The
two of them stole wordlessly up the steps into Harry's dormitory.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny bounced on
Harry's bed as he threw open his trunk and extracted the bag he'd
brought home with him. Ginny sprawled across the bed and peered
inside the trunk, reaching one hand inside to poke around in his
socks. Harry slapped at her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!" he cried.
"Hands off!" Ginny pouted.</p><p class="calibre8">"But I love that
pair with the broomsticks on."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry shook his head
and rummaged around in the bag and extracted the box of chocolate
frogs he'd picked up that morning in Hogsmeade. He handed it to
Ginny absently as he delved deeper into the bag for the envelope
Dudley had given him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Chocolate frogs
huh?" she asked. Harry nodded absently.</p><p class="calibre8">"We can see if we
can find that card of the Drooble's guy," he said, pulling out a
small battery charger. "Damn, I forgot to give this to your dad."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why chocolate
frogs?" asked Ginny. Harry looked up at her, a dirty shirt dangling
from one hand and the battery charger in the other. She looked a
little perplexed. There was a slight scowl on her face and her
forehead was wrinkled as she frowned at the box in her hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"You asked for
chocolate," Harry said throwing the charger on the bed and balling
up the shirt to lob into his laundry basket. "You said you'd need
it. There's plenty of chocolate in a box of chocolate frogs." He
rummaged in the bag again and pulled out his razor, a pair of socks
and a comb before finally locating the envelope. He hastily dropped
everything else haphazardly in his trunk and slammed the lid shut. He
stopped short at the sight of Ginny sitting on the edge of his bed
staring at the box of chocolate frogs as if it owed her a favour.</p><p class="calibre8">"I did, didn't
I?" she muttered. Harry sat gingerly on the bed next to her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you want
something else?" he asked quietly. "It's just … you didn't
really say what sort and we haven't really had a good chocolate
frog jumping contest for ages. Plus we need a new Agrippa and Seamus
said there was a new series of cards being released before Christmas.
We might get some in this box." Ginny turned to him and reached for
his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," she said,
"these are fine; I didn't really specify. You're right." She
squeezed his hand affectionately. Harry leaned down to give her a
soft kiss and soon the parchment envelope and the box of chocolate
frogs lay forgotten on the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">When Dean came
charging in a short time later he groaned, loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Should you two be
doing that in front of Trevor? He's a very impressionable young
toad." Harry looked up, startled to find Dean walking out of the
room with his hand over his eyes and Trevor sitting on the chair next
to his bed, eyeing him with beady, little black eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
looking at?" he asked the toad gruffly and Ginny burst into peals
of laughter. Trevor just eyed them solemnly from his perch on the
chair before hopping down and across the envelope and under Neville's
bed. Ginny bent down to scoop up the chocolate frogs and envelope.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's in
here?" she asked Harry, turning the envelope over in her hands.
Harry swallowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I um … I don't
know, not really," he said quietly. "It's from Godric's
Hollow; from the – my house." Ginny had been about to peer inside
the envelope but stopped abruptly and looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Godric's
Hollow?" she echoed. "You went to Godric's Hollow? Merlin, no
wonder you've gone all quiet." Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I didn't go
to Godric's Hollow," he said. Ginny waited while Harry battled an
internal war with himself about telling her where he'd gotten the
envelope. He had wanted nothing more than to share it with her for
the last twenty-four hours and now that she was here, holding the
envelope, he found himself tongue-tied. When Ginny gently put a hand
on his arm Harry looked up at her. She smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"How's Teddy?"
she asked. Harry was momentarily confused. They'd been talking
about the envelope and now she had asked a completely unrelated
question.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's uh, he's
good – cutting a tooth," Harry replied. Ginny nodded and Harry
wondered what she expected him to say next. Hermione had pressed him
for answers, not relenting until he'd told her everything, or so
she believed. Ginny just ... waited.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you get the
werewolf thing at the Ministry sorted out yesterday?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sort of," Harry
shook his head wearily. "Bill thought it went well but – I asked
Hermione to help." Ginny didn't try to hide her smirk. She ran
the hand on his arm down to loosely grasp his fingers and laid the
parchment envelope down on the bed beside them.</p><p class="calibre8">"She'll be
completely in her element," said Ginny nodding. "I don't think
Teddy could have anyone better looking out for him, you know? That
little boy is going to be so loved – we have to be careful not to
spoil him."</p><p class="calibre8">"You think I'm
doing all right as a godfather?" Harry asked suddenly. He pulled
Ginny with him as he scrambled back onto his bed, resting against the
headboard. Ginny snuggled into his side and he slipped his arms
around her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think you're
doing brilliantly," Ginny replied. "He's very lucky, just like
me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes, and why
are you lucky then?" Harry teased.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because I've
got you," Ginny said very seriously. Harry looked at her,
momentarily lost for words at the seriousness of her tone. It didn't
matter to her that he'd not told her about the envelope and what
he'd been up to. She didn't demand to know what was going on or
prod him and needle him until he told her. She was happy just to be
with him. But he knew she was worried, he could see it lurking in her
eyes. He studied her for a moment; her long eyelashes swept her
cheeks as she blinked. Her cheeks were a faint pink because he'd
slipped one hand around her waist and was softly stroking her back
with his thumb.</p><p class="calibre8">"I went to the
Dursley's," he blurted suddenly. "<em class="calibre9">Dudley</em> gave it to me –
the envelope." Harry leaned his head back on the headboard and
closed his eyes. He felt Ginny stiffen beside him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What was it doing
there?" she asked sounding like she was choosing her words with the
utmost care.</p><p class="calibre8">"They took it,"
he spat, "from the house."</p><p class="calibre8">"How? It's
charmed so Muggles can't see it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Dedalus took
them," Harry answered, letting out a large sigh. "Dudley's
weird. He's like … he's going to be a policeman!" Ginny
wrinkled her forehead in thought.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is that like an
Auror?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, its law
enforcement," said Harry. "Aurors are probably more specialised
than a regular policeman, but I am not sure there is any way to
compare. It's ironic though. He used to beat up me and any other
little kid within a ten mile radius. Not exactly law abiding
behaviour."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't
realise you were going there this weekend," said Ginny idly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I hadn't
planned on it exactly …" he trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you didn't
do it by accident," Ginny rolled her eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was sort of –
I kind of …" Harry sighed. "When the hearing at the Ministry
didn't really resolve anything I needed to just get out of there. I
was just so frustrated. Remember there used to be that statue in the
Atrium at the Ministry? And it got replaced with this absolutely vile
statue that got ripped down?" Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dad said it was
one of the most disturbing things he's seen," she said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a big
gaping hole in the Atrium now, where it used to be," said Harry.
"It's like there's a gaping hole in other places too. It's
nothing like the way it bustled … before. And I don't know who
Kingsley dragged up to speak officially against the legislation but
he was the most nervous wreck of a man I've ever seen. I don't
know how he makes it out of his house, let alone into some position
in the Department for Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was pretty
obvious to me that he was just some person who was reading out
something Bill and Kingsley threw together to fight this Brown idiot.
He had no idea. He probably wasn't even in the Department until
yesterday! I wanted so badly to just tell them where to go, but
there's all these procedures and … law things. I don't know how
they all work. I thought I did but …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well we can
figure it out," said Ginny. "You got Hermione working on it
didn't you?" Harry laughed slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is it wrong for
me to think only Hermione can do this?" Harry asked suddenly. He
looked down at Ginny who shook her head, smiling slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's
perfectly reasonable to turn to Hermione," she answered, "for
that." She was drawing patterns on his chest with her fingers and
Harry let himself forget everything else for a moment and just feel
her gentle touch. It wasn't long before he had captured her lips
with his own and ran his own fingers up her back and into her hair.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry would have
probably really enjoyed himself if it had not been for the fact that
when he flipped her onto her back his own foot connected with the box
of chocolate frogs and sent it crashing to the ground before landing
on the parchment envelope. With a groan Harry pulled away and sat up
to pick up the envelope. It felt heavy in his hands and they shook as
he turned it over. He could feel Ginny kneeling behind him and she
rested one hand lightly on his back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Aunt Petunia had
a photograph on her hall table," he said softly. "It was a baby
picture of my mum. Dudley said they got it at the house in Godric's
Hollow. I wanted to hex them. How dare they go there? I was so angry,
Ginny. They went there and they <em class="calibre9">took</em> something.</p><p class="calibre8">"But then Dudley
gave me … this. He found it there, says there's another one in
here. He kept it for me I think. He's never done anything nice for
me before. What if – what if it's a joke? What if there's
really nothing in here but some old paper?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
parchment," said Ginny softly. "Does Dudley go around with
parchment envelopes much?" Harry snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm scared,"
he said softly turning to face her, the envelope sitting innocuously
between them in his hands, "and I don't know why."</p><p class="calibre8">"What did the
photograph look like," asked Ginny, "the one of your mum?"
Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like a baby,"
he said. "She was sitting with Aunt Petunia and holding a teddy
bear. I've never seen her baby photo before. I want to know if I
looked like her when I was a baby or if … if I always looked like
my dad. What if there isn't really a photo in here? What if it's
all a sick joke?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you want me to
look?" Ginny asked him. Harry turned the envelope over again in his
hands. If Ginny opened it and there was nothing there it would still
hurt. Did he really need Ginny to look at some paper for him? He took
a deep breath and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, but just …
stay here, okay?" he said as he looked her in the eyes and upended
the envelope in front of him. He didn't look down, and neither did
Ginny. They stayed looking into each other's eyes for an impossibly
long time before Harry slowly looked down at the black and white
photographs that lay across Ginny's lap.</p>
