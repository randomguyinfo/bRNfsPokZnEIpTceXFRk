<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_8">*Chapter 7*: Chapter 7</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Harry's
Despair</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The following day
Harry wished he had spent the night in the Hospital Wing. He knew how
to get past Madam Pomfrey after a night in <em class="calibre9">her</em>
clutches; not so Molly Weasley's. Harry wasn't sure exactly how
he got to his bed the night before. He suspected he'd fallen asleep
while he was crying (again!) in her arms and presumed someone either
carried or levitated him up to his four poster in Gryffindor Tower.
He wasn't sure he wanted to know, if he didn't speak of it
perhaps the embarrassment would go away. When Harry tried to get out
of bed he was briskly hustled back into it by Mrs Weasley. Declaring
him completely overwrought, she insisted he spend the day in bed.
Ron, breakfast and a chess board had appeared only moments later.</p><p class="calibre8">It had taken Ron
a considerable amount of time and persuasion to get Harry to respond
to him. Ron, expecting Harry to avoid conversation, had carried on
one himself, dishing out the breakfast and shoving one plate under
Harry's nose until he took it before tucking into his own bacon.</p><p class="calibre8">"George and
Ginny have to stay in bed too," said Ron cheerfully as he set up
the chess board. "Mum made Charlie stay with George and Hermione
stay with Ginny. It's so they don't escape, I reckon. Neither of
them are sick, although it was a pretty nasty Bat Bogey Ginny sent
George's way, let me tell you.</p><p class="calibre8">"She went
mental when George hit you with that blasting hex. I don't think it
was a standard blasting hex either. Wouldn't it be funny if George
learned that from you in the first place, you know, in the D.A? That
all seems so long ago now doesn't it?" Ron stared out of the
window idly as Harry pushed his plate away, having finished only half
of the food on it. He turned away from Ron and pulled the bedcovers
up over his shoulders. Ron roused himself at the noise this made.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny was
completely hysterical, mate," Ron said quietly. "It took the
combined efforts of Bill and Charlie to keep her away from you and
George so that Madam Pomfrey could look you over. They had to give
her a calming draught." Harry gave Ron no response but Ron kept
talking until noon.</p><p class="calibre8">After exhausting
the topic of the previous nights events Ron turned to a running
commentary of the memorial preparations he saw from the window, a
rundown of the sports pages from the Daily Prophet and a recount of
the berating he'd received from Moaning Myrtle for leaving a great
gaping hole in her bathroom. Harry pretended to ignore Ron, curled up
in the bed; head turned away from his best mate while Ron swung on
the chair, charmed his bed hangings to shout 'Slytherins live in
the dark' and tried to play himself at chess. It was only then that
Ron's patience showed any sign of wearing thin.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know, it's
a shame Mum confined Ginny to bed," said Ron, "because she's
good at getting you talking when you are sulking. You keep this up
much longer and I'll die of boredom after surviving the bloody
war!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not so sure
even she'd want to talk to me after what I said to George last
night," Harry said in a low voice, staring at the window he could
just see from his bed. There was no way any of what he had said to
George was in any way excusable.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you
completely mental?" exclaimed Ron. "Why do you think she hexed
George? Besides I think you and George are about even with what you
both said to each other. He's the one in the doghouse though
because he's the one who raised his wand. Mum and Dad are furious."</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't
have to stay here Ron, I won't get out of bed; you can go and do
whatever it is you'd rather be doing than hanging out with me,"
Harry said as he curled further around himself and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mate, there's
no way George really meant it," Ron said to the back of Harry's
head. "'Sides, George is completely torn up about last night. Was
trying to get out of bed and come see you and that's when Mum lost
it at him. She caught George three times before breakfast. Said you
were too fragile to let George loose on you again and that George was
obviously in need of a Good Lie Down. That's when she and Dad went
in and had a little chat with him about hexing the innocent and
unarmed; then they sent Charlie in.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione was
telling me about this Muggle book she read after Si- well after fifth
year. She reckons you and George were just dishing out a healthy dose
of anger and bargaining. I forget what she said you'd probably do
next. She's got a bloody list! Part of grief she reckons. See,
Hermione says the books say you are perfectly normal!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry didn't
respond. He didn't want to remember Sirius; he didn't want to
remember what he'd said to George. He'd been right, why should
Harry survive when others didn't live? If Harry had given himself
up sooner maybe none of them would have died. If he'd found the
Horcruxes sooner, if he'd not spent so long wondering about the
Hallows. He hadn't been quick enough and now families were going to
pay with the lives of their loved ones. They'd been fighting for
their freedom, so their children could grow up in a better world and
he could have ended it sooner, so no one else had to die. He'd been
ready to die, he'd been willing to die he should have died instead
of Fred. Fred wasn't ready to die, he wasn't willing to die.
Burying his face in the pillow Harry let the tears fall again.</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">The low rumble of
voices filled the room but Harry was unable to discern any individual
voices at first. He must have cried himself to sleep (again!) and now
some git was thoughtlessly invading his dorm room and disturbing him.
As the fog of sleep lifted he was able to distinguish the
conversation.</p><p class="calibre8">"-convinced Mum
and Dad to take guest rooms and Dad took Mum to have a lie down
before dinner. So they are out of the way."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is Mum
satisfied that we can take care of those three, she isn't going to
check up on us is she?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It was touch
and go for a while, I think she believed Ron when he said Harry
wasn't about to leave his bed."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think we
all believe that one!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhhh, you'll
wake him up!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't
think she trusts Ginny to stay in bed at all. She has absolute faith
in Hermione though. I think she's counting on George to be in too
much fear to cause any more trouble."</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll be
able to convince them to come down though won't we?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,
absolutely, the other two might prove a bit stubborn."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, let's
leave this one to Ron, we'll work on George."</p><p class="calibre8">Bill and Charlie,
thought Harry dully. Ron must have gotten bored enough to finally
leave. He shifted restlessly and heard the other two go completely
silent. Only minutes passed before Ron returned. Harry heard Bill and
Charlie leave the room and Ron sit heavily in a chair next to his
bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're having
a little meeting shortly," he began without preamble. "It'd be
good if you could join us. It's hard to have a family meeting
without all the family there. We'll be downstairs in the common
room. It's no good pretending you're asleep. I know when you're
sleeping and I know when you're awake. Don't take too long, I
don't know how long I can keep Ginny from storming up here and
yelling."</p><p class="calibre8">'Who does he
think he is,' thought Harry irritably as Ron left, 'Santa Claus?'
Harry rolled over and stretched, thinking over what Ron had said.
They were having a family meeting, obviously without their parents,
so that made it a sibling meeting really and his presence was
expected. It made his heart feel light to feel that acceptance but he
was unaccountably wary and felt what could only be described as a
mixture of fear and apprehension.</p><p class="calibre8">Could he go out
there and simply join in, with everything that had gone on last
night? Just because Mr and Mrs Weasley were apparently of the opinion
that George had been terribly in the wrong was this meeting just a
chance for the others to set Harry straight on his unacceptable
treatment of George?</p><p class="calibre8">Well, he had to
go to the loo anyway so he'd do that first and then see how he felt
about venturing further afield. When he returned Harry noticed a
plate of sandwiches and a goblet of pumpkin juice that had been left
beside his bed, and checking his watch, noticed that it was mid
afternoon and he had missed lunch. Suddenly he was hungry and wolfed
down the sandwiches in very few bites, washing them down with the
juice.</p><p class="calibre8">After that he got
dressed. He sat on the edge of his bed getting out his wand and
twirling it. It was awfully quiet. And it was rather boring and
lonely to be sitting up here alone. But he was trying to be alone,
wasn't he? Absolutely. He needed to be alone. No need to complicate
and confuse the lives of other people with his messed up life.</p><p class="calibre8">He'd just sit
here then.</p><p class="calibre8">And be alone.</p><p class="calibre8">But first he'd
just go down and listen to the others. Sit on the stairs just to hear
their voices and know he <em class="calibre9">wasn't</em>
alone in the world. Just listening would be enough.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry got up and
crept silently down the stairs, his need for company gnawing at him
insatiably. Silently he padded down the stairs until he could hear
the voices in the common room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny, don't
go up there. I am telling you he'll come down when he's ready.
Let him come down on his own terms, not because you've dragged him
somewhere he's not ready to face!" Hermione's voice drifted up
the staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, he
wouldn't have any problems facing anything if certain individuals
could keep their mouths and their wands to themselves!" was Ginny's
reply.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know I'm
sorry about that-" George was cut off by Ginny's scathing retort,</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not me
you need to apologise to!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it isn't
easy to go and talk to a bloke nobody will let me near!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you show
me you can be trusted to behave like a civilised human being and I
might let you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Let him? Ginny
you're not exactly in charge around here!" Ron sounded rather
bored and Harry got the distinct impression that Ginny and George had
been having this argument for some time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, and I
suppose you are in charge, are you Ron?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe I am,
yeah!"</p><p class="calibre8">"If you three
could put your egos and wands away and we could get back to the
matter at hand ... I don't want to explain to McGonagall how we
managed to destroy the Gryffindor common room in one afternoon or
explain to Mum how you two contributed when I was supposed to ensure
you stayed in bed!" Bill sounded incredibly exasperated.</p><p class="calibre8">"There ees the
leetle matter of what ees in these boxes you 'ave brought 'ere
and what you want us to do wiz zem," Fleur sounded impatient and
Harry felt like he could <em class="calibre9">hear</em>
Hermione mirroring her impatience although she had not said anything.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fireworks,"
said Percy. The word rolled off his tongue most unnaturally in
Harry's opinion.</p><p class="calibre8">"We were up to
the matter of repairing Professor Dumbledore's tomb before the
memorial service though. Ron, Hermione, can you just tell me why I
have to keep stalling on resealing it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"See the thing
is, Bill … well … Oh, Harry should really be here for this,"
Hermione sounded pained but Harry was unable to propel himself
forward and down the stairs into the common room to relieve her
suffering.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look, he's
not here right now, so the fact is he needs to put Dumbledore's
wand back in it before it's sealed," Ron broke in impatiently.
Harry started; he had almost forgotten the wand that was secreted in
the pouch that had hung from his neck for so many months.</p><p class="calibre8">"But hang on,"
Charlie spoke slowly. "I thought that was Harry's wand now, it's
the Elder Wand isn't it? I thought he was its master?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah he is,
but he doesn't want it. He wants his own wand, he fixed it and he's
putting the Elder Wand back. So he needs the tomb unsealed until he
does that," Ron answered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wonder what
has happened to the other two of the Brother's things, the
Invisibility Cloak and the Resurrection Stone," Percy mused. "If
the Elder Wand is real then maybe they are too. Some people think so
you know, even if it is supposed to be just a legend." Ron snorted
inelegantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"For a prefect
and Head Boy, Perce you weren't very observant!" Ron laughed.
"Harry's had the Invisibility Cloak since First Year!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well to be
fair Ron, the cloak does keep one hidden I don't know how Percy is
supposed to have seen any of us in it," Hermione stated reasonably.
Harry could see in his mind's eye the others all staring at Ron and
Hermione in shock.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry's got
an Invisibility Cloak?" questioned Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"And you've
been using it to break rules, Ronald?" asked Percy sternly.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">That's
</em>how you got Norberta though the castle
without anyone seeing her!" exclaimed Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, but it
only works if you don't forget to put in on," muttered Hermione.
"You get caught by Filch if you leave it behind after you offload a
dragon."</p><p class="calibre8">"I always
wondered exactly what you lot were doing out of bed, losing
Gryffindor so many points," Percy said sharply. "No one took
Malfoy's babbling about a dragon seriously at all. I think he was
rather put out about that actually."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well," said
Hermione, sounding embarrassed, "at least we won them back and it
really did work out-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Charlie, am I
to understand that you encouraged these children to hide and
transport an illegal dragon?" Percy interrupted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Could we not
refer to us as children?" protested Ron. "I shave you know!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well how old
were you then, Ronald? At eleven one is still a child," Percy said
officiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was twelve
by then actually, so was Hermione, hey I wasn't there anyway it was
those two. Harry was still eleven though. Dunno if he shaves though
…" Ron trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've lived
with him for how long now?" Hermione exclaimed incredulously, "How
can you not know if he shaves?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, we don't
visit each other in the bathroom, Hermione, we're not girls!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I 'ope he
shaves," said Fleur thoughtfully. "Ozzerwise our birthday present
was useless."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, don't
worry, Fleur," interrupted Ginny, "he shaves."</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you
know?" Ron asked sharply.</p><p class="calibre8">"So anyway,"
Bill said sounding half amused and half exasperated, "how did Harry
get an Invisibility Cloak?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a
family heirloom; Dumbledore passed it on, Christmas of first year,"
Ron reminisced. "Between that and the map you two gave him I reckon
we've seen every inch of this castle."</p><p class="calibre8">"Map? What
map?"Percy sounded indignant at the thought that Harry and Ron had
been getting away with things right under his nose with more than one
artefact of which
he had no intelligence.</p><p class="calibre8">"Getting back
to the point," interrupted Charlie. "That doesn't prove the
Resurrection Stone ever existed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well no, it
doesn't," said Hermione. "So if we could move on …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Have you seen
the Resurrection Stone, Hermione?" asked Bill shrewdly. Harry could
have heard a pin drop in the silence that followed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
Hermione whispered eventually. She continued in a stronger voice.
"Anyone who was at Hogwarts last year would have seen it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry got hold
of it, didn't he, Hermione?" Ginny's tremulous voice floated up
the stairwell and Hermione sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Professor
Dumbledore left it to Harry inside the snitch he left him in his
will."</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay, out with
it Hermione, exactly how much of this story are we missing?"
Charlie asked and Harry listened to Ron and Hermione fill the others
in on the Horcruxes they were searching for, the quest for the Three
Brothers' artefacts and ultimately how and why Harry had ended it.</p><p class="calibre8">"So you're
saying that Harry was one of these <em class="calibre9">hor</em>
thingies and he had to stand there and let You-Know-Who kill him to
get rid of it." George's voice was hollow. "And he walked out
there knowing that was the only way to end it? He knew and he let the
tosser do it?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry figured Ron
or Hermione had nodded because the only sound he heard was Ginny as a
sob ripped from her throat. He wanted to run to her but felt drained
of all energy and it seemed to take forever to go down each remaining
step. He had reached the bottom step, not quite in sight of the
common room when Ron cleared his throat and his voice cut through the
stillness.</p><p class="calibre8">"So these
fireworks then, how are we going to set them out? If we put them in
place tomorrow we don't have to worry about them on the day of the
memorial and we can set them off afterwards."</p><p class="calibre8">"We could set
them on the Quidditch stands," said George quietly. "The higher
they are the higher they'll go. They have to be set with care
though; it's actually a bit dangerous."</p><p class="calibre8">"You could ask
Hagrid to help, he likes dangerous things," said Harry as he stood
in the doorway. Eight heads whipped around and then Ginny ran over to
him, gripping him painfully in a bone crushing hug.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right? Is your head okay? Does anywhere else hurt?" Her eyes
searched his, probably for any sign of a falsehood.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think my
lungs are about to be punctured by an overzealous hug," he wheezed.
Ginny blushed and apologised, letting him go and straightening out
his robes. Then she grabbed his hand and pulled him over to sit with
the others. As they neared the fireplace Harry sank into his
favourite chair, pulling his hand from her grip and his knees up to
his chest, he stared into the fire. Ginny paused before sitting on
the arm of his chair. Harry shrank away from that side of the chair,
curling into himself even further. Possibly the others noticed as no
one spoke for several minutes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I think
that asking Hagrid is a splendid idea," Hermione eventually said
briskly. "Perhaps Grawp can help, you know for the really high
ones."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think
levitating them would be safer, Hermione!" protested Ron. "Grawp's
not exactly the picture of grace is he?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ees your
muzzer going to approve of these fireworks?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably not!"
said Charlie cheerfully. "Oh she'll be fine with the fireworks
themselves but if we all vanish to set them up she'll think we're
up to no good and if she knows what we are doing she'll think we
are going to hurt ourselves. Someone's going to have to distract
her."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think
perhaps I had better keep Mother company tomorrow," said Percy
officiously. "I will at least try and convince her that none of you
are up to no good, although I am not sure she will believe me."</p><p class="calibre8">"She's never
going to believe you if you try and say that about us - about me,"
George faltered. The room fell silent again all of them keenly aware
of who was missing, of their loss. Harry blinked desperately to stop
the tears threatening to spill down his cheeks. For once he succeeded
and he continued to stare resolutely into the fireplace. After a few
moments Bill spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"George, I
reckon you have something to say." Harry heard someone shift
uncomfortably and clear their throat. He remained staring into the
fire, uncomfortably aware that he owed George an apology.</p><p class="calibre8">"George, I'm
sorry about what I said last night," Harry managed to say quietly,
still looking into the fire. "I was out of line and I shouldn't
have said that to you." Harry thought he heard George swear under
his breath. There was a rustle of robes and suddenly George was
standing in front of Harry who flinched and backed himself further
into the chair. George squatted on his haunches, making his face
level with Harry's.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think I owe
you an apology Harry," he stated simply. "I belittled your loss,
blamed you for Fred's death, wished <em class="calibre9">you</em>
were dead and drew my wand on you. That's pretty poor form and it
really has no excuse."</p><p class="calibre8">"But it's all
true," Harry whispered in a pained voice as he raised his eyes to
finally look at the assembled Weasleys and Hermione. "Why am I
still here when other people are dead? I <em class="calibre9">shouldn't
</em>be here, I <em class="calibre9">should
</em>be dead. Other people have sacrificed
family. You have all sacrificed family. I don't have any family so
it should have been me; my family isn't going to miss me are they?
They're gone." Harry got up abruptly, making George stumble
backwards, and headed towards the portrait hole. He got halfway there
before he felt a strong hand on his arm, spinning him around.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you
ever think that you don't have any family to miss you," Bill
said. "We would all lay down our lives for you –"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well of course
you would, Dumbledore convinced everyone they had to. Protect me;
coddle me until I get to die at the hands of some madman who
accidentally turned me into something that tethered him to this life
and then I can take him out on the way down!" Harry shouted,
jerking his arm away from Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said
Bill fiercely. "We would all lay down our life for you, in a
heartbeat, because you're family, because we love you and we don't
want to lose you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred's life
wasn't worth more than yours," said George as he walked over.
Harry took a step back. "If anyone had made me choose between you
and Fred I'd have chosen myself before either of you. He knew what
he was getting into. We knew that fighting for our freedom could mean
death but we had to do it, to make this world safe. It's not your
fault. Fred and I knew what we were doing and we knew why." George
stopped in front of Harry who had backed into a wall and crossed his
arms over his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt like a
cornered animal. George let out a breath and ran his hands through
his hair before swearing softly. He turned to Bill and while the
attention was off him Harry took the opportunity to flee.</p><p class="calibre8">He escaped out of
the portrait hole, ran down the stairs and darted behind a tapestry
hiding a secret passage on the sixth floor. He'd been petrified
that George was going to draw a wand on him again, and it was an
unnatural and unnerving feeling. Harry stopped and leant against the
wall, breathing hard. He had heard George's voice and he knew that
George wasn't going to hurt him but that didn't stop his body
betraying him and he had been unable to control his reactions. Was
this how it was going to be from now on? Would he be always deathly
afraid of everyone?</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sank to
floor, his head in his hands. If they loved him, as Bill had said,
why was he so terrified?</p>
