<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_41">*Chapter 40*: Chapter 40</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
40.</strong></p><p class="calibre8">"She's what?"
Harry asked blankly. George turned to look out of the window at the
lightening sky.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pregnant," he
whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like with a baby,
pregnant?" Harry was sure he was still half asleep and he hadn't
heard George correctly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What other sort
of pregnant is there?" George asked incredulously as he left the
window and began pacing.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry, his bare feet
freezing and the draft from the window going down the back of his
neck, went to stoke up the burning embers in the fireplace. He stood
huddled in front of the tiny flames, throwing on a couple of pieces
of wood to coax the fire back to life. Harry was suddenly sick of
Ginny's brothers interfering. Maybe he and Ginny had been a little
indiscreet, but his relationship with Ginny wasn't casual.</p><p class="calibre8">"While you might
find this very amusing," Harry said, "I don't think it's
particularly funny."</p><p class="calibre8">"Funny?" George
stopped pacing. "You think this is some sort of joke-"</p><p class="calibre8">"How does Angelina
feel about this?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's pretty
spun out-"</p><p class="calibre8">"This is just
rich, you using<em class="calibre9"> Angelina</em> like this!" Harry exclaimed.
"Besides, Ginny and I are adults!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Keep your voice
down, git!" George hissed. "And what are you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"And we're
perfectly responsible," Harry continued, cutting George off with a
glare. "I wish you lot would get over this idea you seem to have
that I'm going to hurt Ginny or that she's still too young or
whatever stupid issue you have going on this week. Do you all not get
that I want to <em class="calibre9">marry</em> her? That she is it for me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Making up some
<em class="calibre9">pregnancy</em> to prove some stupid point about contraception is
ridiculous!" Harry cried. He let go of the cloak to wave his arms
about to emphasise his point and it hung off his shoulders
precariously. Harry was flushed with a mixture of frustration and
anger; combined with the growing fire, he didn't notice his state
of undress. "I think if I can cast a corporeal Patronus I can cast
an effective, ruddy contraception charm – don't you think? I love
Ginny! I'm not taking any chances with her future."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry pulled the
cloak off his left shoulder and thrust the damaged flesh under
George's nose. The scars were greatly diminished but the shiny,
twisted skin was still visible in the meagre light cast by the fire
and the brightening sky.</p><p class="calibre8">"I did that for
her," Harry growled suddenly. "Everything I do is for her!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," George
said quietly. He shifted uncomfortably. Harry ignored him.</p><p class="calibre8">"People gave their
lives for our future!" Harry knew it was a low blow but it tumbled
out of him anyway. "I'm not playing fast and loose with that
privilege! We don't need you lot slinking around behind our backs
trying to teach us a lesson. We know what we're doing, we're
responsible and this is not a casual, quick shag! I <em class="calibre9">love</em> her!
We've been together for months! Your own <em class="calibre9">mother</em> had less of
a reaction than you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"For Merlin's
sake, Harry!" George interrupted furiously, his face red. "Would
you keep it down? This isn't about you! I don't care if you shag
Ginny on the kitchen table in the middle of dinner – well maybe I
don't want to see<em class="calibre9"> that</em> … the point is; this isn't about
you and Ginny! I'm not talking about you! I'm talking about me! <em class="calibre9">I
</em>managed to play <em class="calibre9">fast and loose</em> and knock Angelina up!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Harry
stared, his face heating up. "You mean like … you and her …"
Harry waved a hand in the air, at a loss for words.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," George
sighed heavily. "Me and her …"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's really
pregnant?" Harry gaped at George. "How – how did that happen?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you mean,
how did that happen?" George raised an eyebrow at Harry. "You
were just in bed – naked – with my sister. I think you know how
it happens. I <em class="calibre9">hope</em> you know how it happens or we need to have
a serious discussion!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ha ha," Harry
said dryly. George clapped Harry on his left shoulder. Harry winced.</p><p class="calibre8">"You see,"
George began, "when a wizard loves a witch very much he has certain
feelings and urges. This causes physical changes in the wizard's
body-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks George,"
Harry said, blushing beet red. "I'm aware of the … mechanics."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well then,"
George said, "you'll be aware that sometimes these mechanics
result in some fun times … and also … babies. Let me spell it out
for you. Angelina and I got mechanical. It was fun. We were also
apparently not very responsible. She's pregnant. I'm the father."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh." Harry sat
down suddenly on the nearest chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," George
laughed mercilessly. "That's what I did. Only it was sort of less
like the sitting and more like falling." He ran his hands through
his hair raggedly. "We didn't plan for this. Harry, what am I
going to do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm …" Harry
scratched the back of his head. He wasn't sure why George was
asking him this. "You're joking, right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You keep asking
me that. I know I make a living of joking; but Harry, I'm really
trying to be serious… could you please give a bloke a break?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You're not
joking," Harry said, still trying to convince himself what George
was saying was true. "She's really …?"</p><p class="calibre8">"If Fred was here,
he'd kill me," George said flatly. "Of course, if Fred was
here, this wouldn't have happened." George clenched his fists,
looking as if he wanted to punch something.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did it happen …
was it while-"</p><p class="calibre8">"That bender we
went on," George nodded, sighed heavily and sank into a chair. "She
only found out today – yesterday, whatever day it is. Oh, what have
I done?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I reckon there
are worse things," Harry said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been up
all night, trying to figure it out," George admitted. "Walking
mostly. I just … I needed to tell someone. Talk to them. I told
Fred … git didn't answer me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably turning
in his grave."</p><p class="calibre8">Against his will,
Harry snorted. George looked at him for a moment before he burst out
laughing. Harry's snort became a full, throaty chuckle and the two
of them began laughing harder.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is the most
ridiculous thing you have ever heard isn't it?" George asked
Harry, tears of laughter rolling down his cheeks.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not that
ridiculous," Harry said, still laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhhh." George
tried to stifle his chuckles. "I don't want anyone else to hear!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hear what?"
Harry asked innocently. "That you're going to be a dad?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm …"
George sat in the slowly brightening living room, staring into space.
"I'm going to be a dad. That's good news, isn't it, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I reckon it
is."</p><p class="calibre8">They sat in silence
for a while before George yawned.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been up
all night, I might go get some sleep," George said. "I can open
the shop late, I guess …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah I could use
some going back to bed," Harry agreed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I bet you could,"
George grinned at him and Harry felt his face heat spectacularly.</p><p class="calibre8">"To sleep!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure …"
George smirked. "Remember the incantation? We don't need another
announcement; Merlin knows Mum's going to pop a vein when I tell
her this."</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell her what?"
A sleepy voice came from the doorway. Both Harry and George spun
around to see Ginny standing there in Harry's pyjama top and a pair
of rather tiny knickers that Harry vaguely remembered from the night
before.</p><p class="calibre8">"That I've been
out all night," George lied smoothly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, well that's
good isn't it?" Ginny said. "Get up to any mischief?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Me? Mischief?"
George asked in mock horror. "Surely you jest, little sister! Looks
like you got up to some though …" He winked exaggeratedly and
Harry wondered if his face would be stained permanently red.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wouldn't call
it mischief-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I would,
young lady!" Molly's shrill voice pierced the air. The three of
them started and turned rather guiltily towards the door. "I would
be interested to know what happened to <em class="calibre9">your </em>pyjamas for a
start." Ginny gulped and eyed her mother carefully before
shrugging.</p><p class="calibre8">"More to the
point," George said cheerfully, "where's the other half of
those?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, Harry isn't
wearing them," Molly said rather pointedly. Harry wanted to sink
through the floor. He grabbed at the cloak and pulled it closed. He'd
been standing there in his boxers. Molly turned to George. "Also
of concern is why you are fully dressed at this hour."</p><p class="calibre8">George stood
unwavering under his mother's pointed gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Got up early to
open the shop," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't lie to
me!" his mother snapped. "You've not been out of bed before
eight o'clock for months and then only because someone forced you
out! And that shirt is not a work shirt! You've been out all night,
haven't you? I know things haven't been good, but this behaviour
has got to stop! You need to start being responsible and that
includes coming in at a respectable hour. I've a good mind to give
you a curfew while you're staying here, young man! Merlin knows
what sort of trouble you're getting into at all hours of the day
and night!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You have no idea
…" George muttered as his mother continued her rant.</p><p class="calibre8">"I could get a
call from St Mungo's in the middle of the night!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Actually that's
likely in a few months, I reckon …"</p><p class="calibre8">"You could really
ruin your reputation going around with all those witches!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I actually have a
fabulous reputation …"</p><p class="calibre8">"We could find you
lying in a ditch!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Possibly … when
Angelina's dad gets hold of me …"</p><p class="calibre8">Molly wasn't
listening to George but Harry was trying desperately not to laugh.
Molly turned to her daughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"And I hope you
remember what I told you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Mum,"
Ginny nodded. "Message received, clear as a bell."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't give me
any lip, young lady," Molly warned. She pierced Harry and Ginny in
turn with a searing look. "I'm willing to turn a blind eye but
<em class="calibre9">don't</em> think I appreciate the underwear parade. I suggest you
go up, to <em class="calibre9">your</em> room, and get something on before your father
comes down."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny scuttled out
of the room promptly. George glanced surreptitiously at Harry before
he squared his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I'll be
off then, lots to do!" he proclaimed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now you can just
march yourself into the kitchen," Molly fixed her son with a gaze
that would freeze water. She continued in a deceptively sweet tone.
"You need breakfast before you go. You too, Harry; it is the most
important meal of the day."</p><p class="calibre8">"But I'm not
dressed-"</p><p class="calibre8">"You can get
dressed after breakfast," Molly said blithely, holding the door
open and gesturing through. Harry and George shared a significant
glance before sidling through the doorway and into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry slid into a
chair, the cloak clutched around him, as George leant casually
against a sideboard, watching his mother get out the bacon and eggs.
Molly waited until the bacon was sizzling and a whisk was merrily
scrambling the eggs before she said anything.</p><p class="calibre8">"I understand that
you have been … very upset." Molly addressed George, who snorted
inelegantly. "However, I cannot ignore this … behaviour any
longer."</p><p class="calibre8">"And there's the
mum we all know and love," George said. "It's wonderful to have
you back from the pits of grief and despair!" Molly fixed him with
a stern gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's enough
of your flippant commentary," she said. "You were out all night.
I do not think I want to know what you were up to while I lay awake
wondering whose bed you were in or if you were drinking yourself
blind."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry wanted to sink
through the floor at this direct speech but George merely shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told you, I
went out with Angie," he said neutrally.</p><p class="calibre8">"All night?"
Molly asked pointedly. George shifted uneasily at her tone.</p><p class="calibre8">"Most of it."</p><p class="calibre8">"The point is,
George," Molly sighed, "we just don't know anymore. How you
are, what you're doing. You never tell us anything that's going
on with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … get
ready," George muttered as his mother turned to the stove to prod
the bacon.</p><p class="calibre8">"What was that,
dear?" Molly asked as she turned around, wiping her hands on her
apron. George shook his head wordlessly. "Well, the point is ... it
really needs to be said … you have to understand …"</p><p class="calibre8">"What she means to
say," Arthur said from the doorway, "is that it's not
appropriate to carry on like this with young women, they deserve more
respect."</p><p class="calibre8">"I worship women,
Dad," George said with a smirk.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm aware of
that," his father remarked dryly. "I seem to remember a rather
vocal young lass that you had the rather unfortunate idea to bring
here." George blanched.</p><p class="calibre8">"The walls in this
house," Molly remarked, "are rather thin. The point is that I
don't think it's a bad idea to remind the pair of you how one
conducts himself in the presence of a lady. Having her home at a
decent hour, instead of being out all night is a good start." She
shovelled some eggs onto a plate, topped it with bacon and plunked it
down in front of Harry, who was trying to blend into the furniture.
What he wouldn't give for a good Disillusionment charm right now.</p><p class="calibre8">"But it was only
me out all night!" George grumbled. "She was in well before …
three o'clock."</p><p class="calibre8">"Privacy is very
important," Molly said, rolling her eyes at George's comment.
"Specifically hers-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, so you mean
don't walk in on Ginny in the shower, that sort of thing?" George
asked innocently.</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" his mother
snapped. "I mean you shouldn't talk about your … exploits with
whomever you fancy!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh that's not
fair," George remonstrated. "I never tell you lot anything. Hey,
can I talk about someone else's exploits?" He grinned at Harry,
who scowled furiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" Molly said
in a strangled tone, nearly dropping a plate of bacon and eggs in
Arthur's lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"There is nothing
that goes on in this house that we don't know about," Arthur
said, gently taking the plate from his wife and sliding the food back
onto it. Harry froze.</p><p class="calibre8">"There is very
little you could tell us, George," Molly snapped. "However, next
time you drag Harry out of bed, give him a chance to get dressed.
However much he is family, it's just not appropriate because …
well, there are ladies present."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny's not
seeing anything new," George said casually, sitting down and
accepting the plate of bacon and eggs his mother pushed towards him.</p><p class="calibre8">"George!" Harry
was mortified, his face was flaming and he wanted a hole to open up
in the floor and swallow him. He couldn't look either of Ginny's
parents in the eye.</p><p class="calibre8">"Perhaps not,"
Molly said in a strained tone, "but I won't tolerate this causal
behaviour any longer, George Weasley! No more! You need to stop this
reckless behaviour and really think about your activities. <em class="calibre9">Especially</em>
those which involve young women who deserve to be treated with
consideration. Your father and I raised you to be respectful young
men, not some sort of Ferro Fernwicker!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who?" Harry
asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Womaniser from
her favourite magazine serial," George whispered out of the corner
of his mouth as his mother kept going on about respect, honour and
courtship.</p><p class="calibre8">"These things are
not old-fashioned!" Molly finished and her face was flushed and she
was waving a finger in George's face expressively.</p><p class="calibre8">"How come Harry's
not in trouble?" George asked petulantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who said he's
not?" his father said quietly. Harry looked up, startled, to find
Arthur's eyes twinkling merrily. Arthur stood up and slid his arms
around his wife's waist. "Ginny's just like you, my love;
beautiful, fiery ... Harry's in all manner of trouble." George's
snicker turned to a groan as his father bent to nuzzle his wife's
neck. Molly giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and George
just looked at each other. When they turned back to Molly and Arthur
it was to see Arthur's hands wandering into territory Molly had
just told Harry and George to stay out of.</p><p class="calibre8">"You, my darling,"
crooned Arthur, "are wonderful. Don't be too hard on the boys;
anyone who has what I have is a lucky man indeed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, yes,"
Molly said breathlessly while George and Harry stared in growing
horror at the way her hands circled Arthur's waist, threatening to
travel lower. "If it's … it's not something … not something
casual."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, Mollywobbles,
you are such a passionate woman …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's beat it,
Harry!" George hissed urgently, standing up suddenly. "Once he
says Mollywobbles it gets a bit … well, we don't need to see
that!" George grabbed a piece of bacon and a slice of toast with
one hand and Harry's collar with the other and dragged him out of
the kitchen. Out of the corner of his eye Harry though he saw Arthur
start kissing Molly's neck and he was glad George had the foresight
to save them when he had.</p><p class="calibre8">"No wonder there's
seven of you!" Harry gasped as they took the stairs two at a time.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," George
replied. "I'm surprised there aren't more of us! The number of
times Fred and I caught them … all over the house … kissing and
snuggling and … and she had the gall to reprimand us!"</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny was hovering
on the landing outside her bedroom door. She was now fully dressed
and Harry blushed as she eyed him appreciatively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't go down
there yet, Gin," George warned her. "He called her Mollywobbles."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, that's
never good," Ginny grimaced. "Still it doesn't always turn out
a disaster … I might be able to risk it."</p><p class="calibre8">"If the behaviour
we just witnessed is anything to go by, Mum and Dad are about to
Christen the kitchen table!" George said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I already
caught them doing that the summer after your second year," Ginny
laughed. "But it's absolutely nothing compared to how I found
them in the orchard when I was six!"</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Obliviate</em>
me now, Harry," George moaned.</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">When Harry had
showered and dressed, he returned to the breakfast table and found
Ginny helping her mother with the dishes at the sink and his plate
still under a warming charm. George was nowhere to be seen and Arthur
was reading the paper at the table. Harry sat down silently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Want some juice?"
The voice startled him and he jumped. Ginny was standing next to him,
holding a pitcher of pumpkin juice. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks," he
answered quietly when she'd finished pouring. He took a sip
hesitantly. It was all so normal. No one had flown off the handle and
he hadn't been kicked out. Harry waited for the axe to fall.</p><p class="calibre8">"They really need
to do something about this, Molly," Arthur said suddenly, the
newspaper rustling as he laid it on the table. "These poor children
have been stuck in St Mungo's for weeks now, only because they have
nowhere to go. It's disgraceful."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well didn't you
speak to Kingsley?" Molly said. She came over, wiping her hands on
a tea towel. "Harry dear, the warming charm isn't going to last
forever and Ginny says you have a lot to do today. Eat up!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you up
to today, son?" Arthur asked absently, still scanning the newspaper
and shaking his head. "I did speak to Kingsley but he can't seem
to get through the parchments, either. Honestly, we're lucky to
have come out of this with as few orphans as we did, but the Ministry
is just being so cautious and doing things by the book since the end
of the war."</p><p class="calibre8">"Orphans?" Harry
asked, his curiosity overcoming his fear of what Ginny's parents
thought of the previous evening's activities.</p><p class="calibre8">"Poor little
mites," Molly murmured, reading over her husband's shoulder. "Are
they still pretending to try and find some relatives?" Arthur
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"There are orphans
at St Mungo's?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're just
babies," Molly sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who?" Harry
insisted. Arthur looked up from the paper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Some weeks ago it
came to our attention that there was a Death Eater stronghold that
hadn't been properly searched," Arthur sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"There were
children there?" Harry asked. "After all this time?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Two little ones,"
Molly nodded. "Thank Merlin for the house-elves."</p><p class="calibre8">"But why?" Ginny
asked. She sounded pained. Harry reached for her, intending to
comfort her with a gentle touch but she slid into his lap, her eyes
on the newspaper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why were they
there?" her father asked, looking over the top of his glasses at
her. Harry couldn't meet his eyes and wondered what Ginny's
parents thought of her actually sitting on his lap at the breakfast
table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Death Eaters
don't kidnap," Ginny answered. "They hurt and torture, but they
don't keep you." She sounded scornful.</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't know
what they're capable of," Molly snapped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes I do,"
Ginny shot back. Harry could feel her back stiffen as she eyed her
mother grimly. Molly sighed and turned away, knowing Ginny was right.
Forcing down his unease at such a display in the kitchen, Harry put
his arms around Ginny and leaned over to kiss her cheek softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"They didn't
waste time with kidnapping at school last year," Ginny said.
"Torture did them just fine." She sounded angry and bitter.</p><p class="calibre8">"They took Luna …
to make her father do what they wanted," Harry said quietly. "And
then … they took Hermione because they knew it would make us crazy.
I – I couldn't bear it but Ron … I think it would have been
easier if they'd beaten him. He just … it's just another form
of torture." Ron's hoarse screams and the pounding on the door as
they were shut in the cellars at Malfoy Manor echoed through Harry's
head and he shuddered, closing his eyes. Ginny turned in his embrace
and softly caressed his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
she said. "I didn't think of it like that."</p><p class="calibre8">"S'okay."</p><p class="calibre8">"We don't think
they were kidnap victims," Arthur said quietly. "We think they're
… the strongholds were where the Death Eaters lived and … there's
evidence these children are theirs."</p><p class="calibre8">"Death Eaters have
children?" Ginny asked blankly before shaking her head. "Well
obviously they do … I just … it's a weird concept that there
are … babies."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" Arthur
asked her thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's just
…" Ginny trailed off a faint blush staining her cheeks before she
took a deep breath and continued. "Babies are … they come from
love." She was fidgeting slightly as if she hadn't really said
what she wanted to say.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Molly sat
down and watched Ginny as she struggled with her thoughts. Harry
listened intently, curious to hear Ginny's train of thought.</p><p class="calibre8">"Obviously I know
how people become parents," Ginny said, sitting up straighter and
sounding more confident. "And well … it's just – how do Death
Eaters feel that? They hold onto so much hate and they're …
there's no love there. How is it that they … I mean it feels…
how do they <em class="calibre9">feel </em>enough to … make love?" She blurted the
last two words as if forcing them out of her mouth, her face flushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Those actions are
not always motivated by love, Ginny dear," Molly said gently.
"Sometimes it's power or even violence, but … even those who
followed Voldemort had those whom they loved, I'm sure."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't believe
it," Ginny said flatly. "A person who feels what it's like to
share themselves intimately – how can they hurt and torture and
kill other people? Once you feel that how can you still want to hurt
and torment people?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not everyone has
the same experience as you've had," Molly replied. Harry stared
intently at a spot just above the kitchen sink, his face heating
spectacularly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But … children
…" Ginny seemed to be struggling for words once again. She took a
deep breath and squeezed Harry's hand. "Parents – when you're
a parent … they <em class="calibre9">die</em> for their kids!" Harry sucked in a
breath involuntarily and Ginny gripped his hand tighter.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sure their
parents loved them," Arthur said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"How could they?"
Ginny cried. "How could they love their kids and then hurt and
torture other people's? How could they have babies and share that
love, that special bond with each other and then just <em class="calibre9">hurt</em>
children? They can't have loved those babies or they wouldn't
have chained Michael to that wall for rescuing that little first
year! They wouldn't have broken his arm and made his wrist bleed
from the shackles! And they would have let him go see Madam Pomfrey!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny-" Molly
reached across the table but Ginny shrank away from her.</p><p class="calibre8">"If they had
babies of their own, how could they order the entire second year to
miss out on tea because someone let off a Dumgbomb during Muggle
Studies?" Ginny was shaking now and Harry began to run his hands up
and down her arms, making shushing noises and trying to steady her
trembling limbs. "We all snuck them some food but Roger Entwhistle
got caught and they put him in the dungeon for the whole night! And
when he fell asleep during Defence Against the Dark Arts the next day
they gave him to Crabbe for <em class="calibre9">Crucio</em> practice."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny leapt up, out
of Harry's lap, tears beginning to roll down her face. She clenched
her fists and held her arms rigidly at her sides.</p><p class="calibre8">"They <em class="calibre9">can't</em>
know what it's like to love!" she sobbed. "How can they? They
don't know how beautiful it is! There's nothing but blackness in
them and darkness and – they don't know! They can't know! How
can they do that and still not <em class="calibre9">feel</em> it? How can they throw
away that … that intimacy and be so cruel? How can they have
children and <em class="calibre9">still love them</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," Harry
said quietly, reaching out to her, putting one hand on her arm. She
looked at him, her brown eyes filling with tears.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
beautiful," she whispered to him. "How can they not feel it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Harry
gathered her into his arms. He swayed gently back and forth, rocking
Ginny as she cried.</p><p class="calibre8">After a while
Ginny's tears dried up and she straightened up, sniffing a little.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am such a
goose," she said, shaking her head ruefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"No you aren't."
Harry smiled at her. Ginny didn't notice, she took a few steps to
the table and gazed at the article in the Daily Prophet.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're so
innocent," she said, reaching out a hand to touch the cherubic
faces of the two small children pictured in the morning paper. A
headline underneath proclaimed them homeless. The picture was
surrounded by articles about how they were found. There was a list of
known Death Eater haunts that at least one reporter suggested the
Ministry officials check for more 'strays' and a plea for anyone
who knew who they were to contact St Mungo's.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can they stay,
Harry?" Ginny asked suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stay?"</p><p class="calibre8">"At the Home,"
Ginny said. "Can they stay there – at least for Christmas?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Where, dear?"
Molly asked. Harry jumped. He'd forgotten Molly and Arthur were
there.</p><p class="calibre8">"At Sirius House,"
Ginny explained, "at number twelve, Grimmauld Place. It's ready
in time for Christmas."</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll need to
talk to Mrs Chumley," Harry said. "They're a bit smaller than
the others. They'll need more care."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, she can't
say no!" Ginny cried.</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you …
who says where they can go though?" Harry looked up at Arthur,
questioning.</p><p class="calibre8">"I really think …
well, Kingsley couldn't cut through the legal parchments
surrounding this," Arthur said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then what do we
do now?" Ginny frowned slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I suspect that,"
Arthur hesitated slightly. "I suspect that Harry might actually
have more influence than Kingsley." Harry raised his eyebrows.</p><p class="calibre8">"It went to the
Wizengamot and they didn't want the children just … out there,"
Arthur said quietly. "They are very concerned that they be under
the best of influences. Very few people are allowed near the children
at all. They mean well but …"</p><p class="calibre8">"So the children
need a guardian?" Molly asked. "Someone who will … who the
Wizengamot think will be a good influence, keep them from going Dark.
And because they can't decide where the children should live they
are keeping them homeless and isolated?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Arthur
said simply.</p><p class="calibre8">"Barbaric,"
proclaimed Molly with finality.</p><p class="calibre8">"So why has Harry
got more influence?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's Harry
Potter," her father replied matter-of-factly. Arthur looked at
Harry in what he could only think was an apologetic manner before
continuing. "He's … a war orphan himself and as the person who
defeated Voldemort; a certified, well, Defender of the Light, one
would say."</p><p class="calibre8">"You think I have
a chance to get these kids out of St Mungo's?" Harry asked, as he
pulled the newspaper towards him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably the only
one who does right now," Arthur admitted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why didn't you
ask me before?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It would involve
being their legal guardian," Arthur replied gently. "It's a lot
to ask of an eighteen-year-old young man."</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you think I
wouldn't do it?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course you
would," Arthur replied immediately. "And that's why I insisted
Kingsley didn't ask you. Don't you think you've made enough
sacrifices, Harry? These children aren't your problem. No one will
let them starve and we'll sort out a home for them eventually-"</p><p class="calibre8">"And do you really
think that's good enough?" Harry asked harshly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said Molly
sharply. "Of course it's not good enough but it's not fair to
ask you to do more and children are such a responsibility-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sirius House is
set up with a guardianship board," Harry said quietly. "If the
Chairman of this board was to submit an application for their
guardianship and residence …?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I think he'd be
granted the application," Arthur said, smiling.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've set all
that up?" Molly asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, not
entirely," Harry admitted, scratching the back of his head. "I
mean Percy set up most of it. He knows how to do all this paperwork
stuff and Hermione researched all the legal things to send him. And
Bill figured out how to set up the funds. I don't think the goblins
were immensely happy when we turned the Black family fortune into the
<em class="calibre9">James and Lily Potter Foundation</em> and the <em class="calibre9">Remus Lupin
Perpetual Education Fund</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodness you have
been busy," Arthur said in surprise.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think
Kreacher's done most of the work though," Harry continued. "I
hired someone to run the House but … I wanted to ask …"</p><p class="calibre8">"If we can help,
Harry dear," Molly smiled at him, nodding firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think Mrs
Chumley will need some help from time to time," Harry said. "She's
not magical and … Kreacher will be there but … there are four
Hogwarts students coming for Christmas." Harry shifted anxiously as
he watched Molly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's the
mother of those dear boys we met at King's Cross, isn't she?"
Molly asked, her face a mask of concentration.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Harry
answered. "Her husband never came home and she lost her job and …
anyway, she has one now so there will be six children there for the
holidays and if we add these two, well, eight children …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd love to
help, Harry dear," Molly said firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I made
arrangements to meet her this morning-"</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll need to
get down to the Ministry with Arthur," Molly said decisively. "Get
those poor mites out of St Mungo's. Ginny and I will go and meet
Mrs Chumley and see if we can't soften the blow of meeting Kreacher
and make sure that house is running the way it's supposed to …
recast the charms if necessary … I'll need to make sure Kreacher
has organised enough linens and ensure he's not kept those ghastly
elf heads."</p><p class="calibre8">"I threw those
away myself," Harry said chuckling as he watched Molly summon a
parchment and quill. She began to scribble hastily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think that
elf remembered to get Christmas decorations?" Molly asked. "I'll
need to get some more wool if they're all to have a jumper ….
Goodness, I might have to use magic to get finished in time this
year." She continued scribbling furiously and Arthur watched her
fondly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh!" Molly
exclaimed suddenly. "Ginny, go and wake Fleur. She can come and
help us. We'll need to introduce Mrs Chumley to the food vendors in
Diagon Alley and set up an account system with them and I'll try
and figure out a way for her to contact St Mungo's so that she can
call them if one of the children are ill. I'll take my kitchen
charms book ... I'm sure Kreacher is capable of many things but
setting up a woman's kitchen isn't one of them. I'll Muggle
proof it so the poor dear can make a cup of tea without calling on
that elf all the time. All right then, you two, off to the Ministry.
We only have a few weeks until Christmas!"</p><p class="calibre8">She bustled out of
the kitchen, pushing Ginny in front of her. Arthur watched her
fondly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, Mr Weasley,"
Harry said nervously. Arthur turned to look at him, raising his
eyebrows.</p><p class="calibre8">"Arthur," the
older man said softly. Harry nodded and cleared his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was wondering
if …" Harry took a deep breath. "Would you be on the board,
too? It's just, you know more about kids than any man I know and
you work for the Ministry and Andromeda has her hands full with Teddy
and Mrs Chumley's a Muggle so … and I don't have a clue what
I'm doing. Not really."</p><p class="calibre8">"Andromeda's on
the board?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
nodded and stuffed his hands in the pockets of his jeans. "I
figured since I was about to dismantle the Black family fortune and
turn the ancestral home into … well ... an orphanage, there should
be a Black on the board. I didn't think Narcissa and I would get
along."</p><p class="calibre8">Arthur chuckled
before nodding briefly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You have some
sort of paperwork for this, I gather?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy's got
it," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"No doubt he can
rustle up the paperwork to apply for guardianship of these two,"
Arthur said, waving at the paper. "Let's Floo him, see if he
can't meet us at the Ministry and then we can meet up with the
ladies later, while there's still daylight. I'm sure you two can
think of better things to do than stay cooped up with a couple of old
folks like us."</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," Arthur
said suddenly, "you are being careful, aren't you?" Harry
froze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I – ah …"
Harry dragged a hand through his hair nervously, unable to look
Ginny's father in the eye. "She, um … Mum taught her the
charms-"</p><p class="calibre8">"With her heart,"
Arthur said gently. Harry looked Arthur directly in the eye for the
first time since the other man had said he knew everything that went
on inside the walls of his home. "Ginny's right, it is a special
bond. She has to trust you, open up to you and give you her heart.
Are you being careful with it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We didn't
wait," was all Harry said, studying the floor intently. "I'm
sorry."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not everybody
waits," Arthur said in the same quiet, gentle tone. "There's no
rule that says you have to. Some people do, I guess – the
churchgoing folk mostly. My great grandfather was religious; I used
to go to church with him sometimes as a very small boy, before he
died. My own father was never particularly religious but he always
said to me, 'It's important to respect witches, Arthur. Never
treat them different to how you'd treat your mother.'</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't tell
you what to do, Harry, you know that; but the commitment you've
shown to my Ginny is clear; hers for you is unwavering. You've
already chosen each other. I'm just a father who wants to know that
the man who has my daughter's heart is being careful with it.
Because she's yours now; she gave herself to you and that's the
most precious thing she can give you, until she gives you a child. I
just want to know that you're being careful with her heart."</p><p class="calibre8">"I love her,"
Harry said a little defensively. "I'm not playing around or
anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Arthur
said. "I can see. She's who you look for when you walk into a
room. She's who you reach for when you're troubled and she's
the one who makes you smile. She's the most important person in
your life. Make sure she always knows it."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think I need to
work on that," Harry admitted quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Molly said you
two had a bad patch," Arthur said nodding.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
I've really dealt with … things yet," Harry said, staring at
the newspaper, at the picture of the two small children.</p><p class="calibre8">"What things?"
Arthur asked, sitting down and gesturing to Harry to take a seat
also. "If there's anything I can do, anything you need help with,
you only have to ask." Harry sat down at the table and sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been
ignoring the fact that – well … um, I'm sort of …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Famous?"
supplied Arthur with a smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah but it's
more than that now, isn't it?" Harry asked. "These children …
you said I would be able to make a difference here where even
Kingsley can't. But … no one told me."</p><p class="calibre8">"We've tried to
shield you," Arthur admitted. "It's been fairly easy. Your
decision to go back to Hogwarts has made it easy to shelter you."</p><p class="calibre8">"But why?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We just wanted
you to have time," Arthur said, "time to just be Harry, to
recover."</p><p class="calibre8">"I knew there were
things I wasn't being told," Harry said, "things about the
aftermath of the war. I found out there were families who were
homeless; children who literally have nowhere to go. I wish you'd
told me."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Arthur said.</p><p class="calibre8">"But the thing
is," Harry said intently, "it's just going to make it harder
for Ginny, isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"There will
probably be a lot of demands on your time," Arthur admitted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I already proved
I can't do both," Harry said miserably, running his hands through
his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Setting up the
Children's Home took your time away from Ginny?" Arthur asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
admitted. "I was doing that and then there's Teddy and I'm Head
Boy. We had a bit of a misunderstanding about it all. Once the
children are actually living at Grimmauld Place I'll be even busier
won't I?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It takes all of
us a while to learn to balance things," Arthur reassured him,
clasping his shoulder. "Ginny has things to do also. I'm sure it
wasn't solely your fault."</p><p class="calibre8">"She's been
training a lot for her chance with the Harpies," Harry said. He sat
in silence for a moment before he sighed. "Being a grown up is
hard." Arthur laughed heartily at that and nodded emphatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"It is Harry, but
so far I think you're doing just fine!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I would never
hurt her," Harry said suddenly. "I'm sorry we didn't wait
but-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's your
choice, Harry no one else's," Arthur interrupted. "But if you
ever need anything … some advice or even just to talk, you can come
to us."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Harry
said. He looked up at Arthur and smiled shyly. "Thanks, Dad."</p><p class="calibre8">*************</p><p class="calibre8">Percy looked
extremely flustered when Harry and Arthur arrived at his office.
There were untidy piles of parchment littering his desk. Ink dripped
slowly over the edge from a row of ink bottles tipped haphazardly
across the surface. An overflowing rubbish bin was groaning in the
corner as if it has just eaten a massive Hogwarts feast all by itself
and an enraged owl fluttered above Percy's head.</p><p class="calibre8">"What happened?"
Harry asked, leaping forward to catch a teetering pile of parchment
as it began to cascade towards the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told it to sod
off," Percy growled through gritted teeth. "Now it's gone
mental at me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not the owl,"
Arthur said as he siphoned up the ink, "this mess. It's very
unlike you Percy."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked closely
at Percy. His robes were rumpled and his hair stuck up on one side as
is he'd been laying on it, his glasses were smudged and sitting a
little crookedly on his nose and the tops of his shoes were scuffed.
Percy snatched at the owl with an angry growl and pulled the scroll
of parchment off its leg. Percy unrolled it viciously and then tore
it up and threw it at the bin in the corner which cowered in fear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Penelope told me
that she would be cancelling the wedding arrangements," Percy said,
scrubbing a hand across his unshaven face. "It appears, however
that she has neglected to do so. This owl is from the catering
company who is being rather difficult."</p><p class="calibre8">"You hired a
catering company?" Arthur asked, his eyebrow raised. "Do be sure
not to tell your mother that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Caterer, florist,
baker, decorator, jeweller," Percy rattled off tossing a sheaf of
parchment onto the desk. "And she forgot to cancel them all!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, as long as
it's sorted out," Arthur said patting his son on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"I guess it will
be at any rate," Percy sighed, sinking into his chair. Arthur set
about straightening Percy's desk.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry just hovered
nervously for a moment, taking in the strange appearance of the
office and its occupant.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have you had much
rest lately, Percy?" Arthur asked quietly as the piles of parchment
flew into orderly piles at the direction of his wand. "You're
looking a little … ragged."</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a lot
to get done," Percy sighed. "Most people think the efforts to
rebuild can slack off a little now. They're men and women with
families; I can't say I blame them. Cyril Ogden's family came
back from France last week so he took a week off. Hasn't seen them
in over a year so …"</p><p class="calibre8">"But you're here
on a Saturday, still," Arthur said as he cast a spell at the bin,
restoring it to its empty state and levitating the crumpled parchment
inside. "There's few people left who need to work on a Saturday,
Percy."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well they clearly
don't understand the importance of administrating things in the
wake of the war's end," Percy said primly. "There are still a
lot of pressing matters to attend to."</p><p class="calibre8">"What is so
pressing you're still wearing the same clothes as yesterday when we
had lunch?" Arthur asked. "Did you sleep here?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone has to
see to the matter of Knockturn Alley and the rebellion of the slug
growers," Percy said, shuffling a few parchments idly. Arthur
raised an eyebrow at his son. Harry stifled a laugh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right," Arthur
said with a slight frown. "We just need some help with this
Guardianship Board …"</p><p class="calibre8">****************</p><p class="calibre8">With the paperwork
appropriately filed, Harry and Arthur went straight to Grimmauld
Place to find a freshly-painted door right where number twelve should
be, a gleaming brass doorknocker shining in the late morning
sunlight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Looks good,"
Arthur commented as they crossed the street. "Filius removed all
the charms then, I take it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
nodded. He paused to look at the small, brass nameplate near the
door. <em class="calibre9">Sirius House</em> it read in small, block letters. It was
very shiny and Harry suspected Kreacher had been polishing it more
than once a day.</p><p class="calibre8">He pushed the door
open and his ears were immediately assaulted with a horrible screech.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Filthy blood
traitors! Defiling the house of my ancestors! Vile and loathsome
little beast! Vermin! Filth!"</em></p><p class="calibre8">Mrs Chumley was
staring in open mouthed horror while Molly waved her wand
frantically. Kreacher was standing there wringing his hands. Ginny
was standing defiantly in the hallway bellowing back at the portrait.</p><p class="calibre8">"Language, Ginny!
Please!" Molly remonstrated with her daughter as she waved and
poked her wand in the air futilely.</p><p class="calibre8">"What happened to
the curtains?" Harry bellowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher did not
mean to vanish them," the house elf said rather sadly. "Kreacher
was only trying to clean them." Harry shook his head and pulled out
his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"SHUT UP!" His
wand emitted a shower of red and gold sparks and the portrait was
silenced. Harry rubbed the back of his head sheepishly as the
occupants of the entranceway turned to stare at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did you …?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It worked last
time," said Harry. He shrugged. "Now we need a way to get it off
this wall …"</p><p class="calibre8">"What … it
talks,' Mrs Chumley said nervously. Molly patted her on the arm
gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll go and
join Fleur in the kitchen for a nice spot of tea and leave the men to
dispose of that objectionable thing," Molly said, giving both Harry
and Arthur a meaningful look. "Come along, Ginny." Ginny followed
her mother but not before poking her tongue out at Harry and
wrinkling her nose.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sighed as she
vanished down the kitchen steps. He wanted to do much more than stare
at her retreating backside, as lovely as it was. After all it had
been an entire morning without her company. He heard Arthur chuckle
beside him.</p><p class="calibre8">"The sooner we
figure this painting out, the sooner you can get back to it, er,
her," Arthur said before turning to the portrait and rubbing his
hands together briskly. "Right, first things first; how is this
stuck up here, Kreacher?"</p><p class="calibre8">The information that
had never before been forthcoming from the wizened house-elf tumbled
from his mouth. Harry didn't understand a word of it but Arthur
nodded gravely as Kreacher mumbled something about ancient dark
wizardry.</p><p class="calibre8">"My mistress,"
Kreacher suddenly croaked pathetically, throwing himself at the frame
and crying piteously.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Evil scum! Elf
traitor! I'll have your head for this betrayal!</em>" Mrs Black
renewed her incessant screeching, unleashing a litany of foul words
at Kreacher.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had never seen
such a reaction in all his years in the magical world. Kreacher drew
himself up the full height of his tiny stature and glared at the
portrait. Then he screamed; an ear-splitting sound that made both
Arthur and Harry clap their hands over their ears. The elf's hands
flew out in front of him and he twisted them in a complicated pattern
of swirls before throwing them up in the air. A cascade of light
showered down from the sparks that began flying off the portrait and
Mrs Black's screeching ceased immediately. Kreacher stopped the
horrible noise he'd been making and threw himself on the floor in a
wailing heap.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher is not a
bad elf!" he wailed. "Kreacher is helping the poor children!"
Harry stood dumbfounded, staring at Kreacher utterly unsure what had
happened and what he should do. Molly and Ginny had come rushing into
the entranceway at some point during the confusion and Harry looked
up as Ginny suddenly gasped.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's gone!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry gazed,
befuddled at the portrait frame which was still attached to the wall,
empty, a few shreds of canvas hanging limply from the edges.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher got rid
of her, yes he did!" wailed Kreacher from the floor. "Kreacher is
not a bad elf!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course you
aren't," Molly soothed. "You are a very good elf; you've done
wonders with this house."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mrs Weasley
thinks so?" Kreacher asked suddenly, lifting his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes," Molly
nodded her head decisively. "The kitchen is wonderfully bright and
clean and the bedrooms are just lovely."</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher does his
best." The little house-elf bowed low, his nose scraping the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now, I'm going
to set the kitchen charms for Mrs Chumley," Molly said, gingerly
patting Kreacher on the head. "Why don't you show Harry and
Arthur the rest of the house?" Kreacher brightened immediately.</p><p class="calibre8">"Master will be
pleased at what Kreacher has done with the bedrooms," the elf said
suddenly, getting to his feet and shuffling towards the stairs. Harry
smiled as Ginny slid her hand into his and trotted along after them
instead of returning to the kitchen with her mother.</p><p class="calibre8">Kreacher had done a
splendid job cleaning up the rooms in Sirius House. The bedroom on
the first floor had been transformed into a cosy room furnished with
two beds, a huge wardrobe and a dresser. A set of heavy curtains at
the window matched the new carpet on the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wish it looked
like this when I had to stay here," Ginny murmured in Harry's ear
as Arthur congratulated the house-elf on his skill.</p><p class="calibre8">The bathroom was
also superbly clean and the drawing room had been revamped
completely. New draperies hung at the windows, the glass fronted
cabinets had been polished until they shone and the fireplace
scrubbed of all the soot and grime. Harry noted with grim
satisfaction that the Black Family Tree had been entirely removed and
the walls were now covered in rich wallpaper. The room was
overflowing with comfortable couches, floor rugs and a large writing
desk. Before they made their way up to the second floor Harry stopped
to examine the new doorknobs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher did not
think Master would think the snake doorknobs appropriate for
children," Kreacher said solemnly. Harry just nodded and smiled a
little at the brass doorknobs, shined to perfection, a lion carved
into the surface of each one.</p><p class="calibre8">The room where Harry
and Ron used to sleep looked similar; but without the gloom and
grime. A pair of twin beds and a wardrobe were the main furnishings
with a small dresser squeezed in next to the window. The place where
Phineas Nigellus used to hang was now occupied with a large mirror.
The rest of the bedrooms were furnished in a similar manner with two
beds in each room, cheerful curtains and matching floor rugs. The
toilets and bathrooms were gleaming and the master bedroom showed no
hint that it had once been used to house a wild animal. When they
arrived at the topmost landing Kreacher pushed open Sirius's
bedroom door tentatively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher knows
that Master told him to decorate all of the rooms however he liked
but this one was restored the same as it was," the house-elf
explained quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope you took
down the bikini girls," Harry murmured and was startled when the
old house-elf laughed. Harry pushed the door open further and walked
inside. Two beds now graced the room and the red window hangings and
bed curtains gave it a look reminiscent of a Gryffindor dormitory.
Kreacher had obviously found a way to rid the room of the permanent
sticking charms. The walls were bare and all traces of dust, debris
and cobwebs had been banished. Kreacher was standing near the
oversized dresser holding a large cardboard box.</p><p class="calibre8">"These are Master
Sirius's things," Kreacher said quietly and held the box out to
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks," Harry
said. His throat closed over and he couldn't say anything. He just
gazed at the top of the box.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe Gilbert and
Gerald would like this room?" Ginny said quietly, laying a hand on
Harry's arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you think
it's a good idea for them to share?" Harry asked, attempting to
grin at her. He failed utterly and to his dismay, felt tears
gathering. Ginny smiled at him sadly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum can probably
take care of Mrs Chumley," she said. "We could go if you like?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sure we can
manage, Harry," Arthur added. Harry shook his head, blinking
rapidly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny snorted. Harry
took one last look at Sirius's room before leaving. Kreacher
scuttled out after the wizards and shut the door with a soft click.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sirius would have
liked it," Harry said softly, still clutching the box. "Turning
it into a Children's Home, I mean."</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course he
would," Ginny said gently. Harry stood staring at the closed door
of Sirius's room for several minutes before Arthur cleared his
throat and laid a hand on the doorknob of the room opposite.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher left
master Regulus's room the same colour as well," Kreacher croaked
as if afraid Harry would scold him for it. Harry gave the elf a weak
smile, his grip on his composure loosening every minute.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's see it
then," he said, taking a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre8">The room was large
enough for two beds and, like Sirius's room it contained a gleaming
chandelier, newly-polished windows and fine new curtains. It had been
purged of its Slytherin leanings and was now an innocuous green
bedroom, brightly-lit and cosy.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've done a
really good job," Harry said to Kreacher, still hugging the box
tightly. He didn't know why as he knew what would be in there, or
rather what he hoped would be in there.</p><p class="calibre8">"I might go down
and talk to Mrs Chumley about the two youngsters," Arthur said,
clearing his throat. "We'll probably have the result of the
application early next week if Percy has anything to say about it.
Will we expect you two home for tea?" Arthur looked at Harry and
Ginny expectantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, we'll be
home for tea," Ginny answered for them both.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, thanks,
Dad," Harry said, mustering a smile and ignoring the tears that
once again threatened to fall against his will. Arthur and Kreacher
both left the room and Harry and Ginny followed them. Ginny stood
uncertainly, watching Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you want to
open it?" Ginny asked him, gesturing at the box. Suddenly Harry was
overcome with the urge to open the box and search through the
contents and he sat down abruptly on the brand new runner on the top
landing. Ginny sank down on her knees next to him as Harry opened the
flaps of the box.</p><p class="calibre8">There, on the top of
a pile of papers and scarlet and gold Gryffindor banners lay the
picture of James Potter, Sirius, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew that
had been stuck to the wall last time Harry had been there. Harry
reached out a hand to trace the features of Sirius and his father
before turning to Remus and sighing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
they're all gone," he said softly. "I'm glad I have this
picture. I think it's the one thing I wanted last time I was here.
It was stuck."</p><p class="calibre8">"So, you don't
want these?" Ginny asked cheekily, pulling at a scrap of shiny
paper peeking out from under one of the banners, revealing a bikini
clad Muggle; her tanned skin glowing artificially and her high heels
at odds with her beach attire. Harry felt himself flush as he shook
his head. Ginny giggled and leaned over to press a kiss to his cheek
and Harry turned to capture her lips in a deep, slow kiss that left
his toes tingling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why don't we
take this box back home," Ginny said as she broke the kiss. "No
one's there at the moment …"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry gaped at her
and shook his head ruefully as Ginny laughed merrily at him. He
slipped the photograph back into the box, closed the flaps on the top
and the two of them made their way quietly down the stairs and
slipped out onto the front steps where they Disapparated away and
back to the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre8">**************</p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't until
they had returned to Hogwarts and settled into the common room after
Sunday tea that the idyllic weekend was broken. Harry was
contemplating a way to convince Ginny to accompany him to somewhere
with a little more privacy when Hermione sat down on the edge of the
couch next to them, twisting her hands nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello, Hermione,"
Ginny said when the other girl didn't say anything for several
minutes. Hermione jumped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello Ginny."
Hermione's fingers plucked restlessly at the hem of her jumper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right, Hermione?" Harry asked, sitting up straighter. "You don't
look-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron hasn't
written in a week," Hermione interrupted.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's never been
the best at correspondence," Harry said, patting her on the arm.
"You know that."</p><p class="calibre8">"But he's
written every second day since I came back to school," Hermione
said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Soppy git,"
muttered Ginny. Hermione gave her a sharp look and turned back to
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"He writes every
second day," Hermione said. "He never misses." Harry was
surprised.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" he
asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"He promised,"
Hermione suddenly wailed. "After last time when he left and … he
promised we wouldn't be apart again and that if we had to be away
from each other he'd write to me always, always!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe the owl
just …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Died,"
interjected Ginny. Hermione looked at her, horrified and Ginny
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pig came back
just now," Hermione said quietly. "He brought the last letter I
sent back. I wrote it on Monday."</p><p class="calibre8">"He brought it
back?" Ginny went pale. Hermione's eyes filled with tears and she
pulled a crumpled scroll out of her pocket. Harry stared at the piece
of parchment and didn't even feel the urge to laugh at the tiny
love hearts surrounding Ron's name on the outside.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think Ron's
missing," Hermione said quietly as she let the tears fall.</p>
