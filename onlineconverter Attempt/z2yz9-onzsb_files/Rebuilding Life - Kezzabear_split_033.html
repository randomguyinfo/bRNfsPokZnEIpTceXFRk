<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_34">*Chapter 33*: Chapter 33</h2>
			<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Thank you
all for your reviews, alerts, etc. It's wonderful to know how many
people enjoy the story. I don't get time to answer many of the
reviews but I do read and appreciate all of them, so thank you!</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
33. Frustration</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry arrived back
at Hogwarts alone as Hermione had gone off somewhere with Ron to
celebrate her birthday. She had invited Harry to join them but Harry
had declined, laughing out loud at the look on Ron's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
back at Hogwarts, Hermione," he said. "Happy birthday and …
thanks." Harry reflected that he'd probably surprised Hermione,
as well as himself, when he'd engulfed her in a hug. In a choked
voice he told her he could never repay her for what she'd just
achieved. Hermione had blushed prettily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Harry, you
should know by now," she said, looking at him solemnly. "We would
do anything for you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Still," Harry
insisted. "I'll do anything for Teddy, and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
interrupted Ron, "your problems are our problems."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's probably
not over," Hermione said softly. "We'll cross that bridge when
we come to it. Now get going, you need to talk to Ginny." Ron gave
Hermione a sharp look as Harry turned and Disapparated.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry missed Ginny.
It was that simple. He'd been preoccupied with other things and had
other students and professors demanding his time. However, he knew
Ginny wasn't just pouting over that. It wasn't the sort of thing
that bothered Ginny, besides she had been snapping at everyone, not
just him. Dean had suggested one night that it was simply women's
problems and Hermione had told him off soundly and actually sent him
to his room. Dean spent the rest of the week warning all of the boys
not to annoy the Head Girl if they wanted to keep their manhood.
Harry hadn't paid any attention to Dean anyway.</p><p class="calibre8">Wishing he had the
map to tell him where he could find Ginny, Harry wandered aimlessly
up to the Quidditch Pitch. She might still be there. Harry couldn't
put his finger on when she'd started acting strangely. Ginny had
just become gradually more withdrawn. Harry cursed himself for not
paying attention earlier. She'd been annoyed when he went to see
Ron the week before and he had attributed it to what George insisted
on referring to as the 'monthly dragon'. Harry could no longer
pretend that Ginny was simply irritable due to … well hormones.
Harry grimaced as he wondered for the hundredth time how he was
supposed to refer to … these things.</p><p class="calibre8">He sighed heavily as
he pushed open the door to the Gryffindor Quidditch changing room. He
wanted to talk to Ginny, tell her his good news and Merlin, he wanted
to kiss her. In fact, if he was honest with himself he wanted to do
more than kiss her. Thoughts of her crept into his mind several times
a day and he'd awoken from more than one dream feeling particularly
flushed. Ginny had apparently been too busy to spare him more than a
peck on the cheek. Everyone had been looking at him sympathetically
for days now. <em class="calibre9">'Not in the mood'</em>, Ginny said last night and
picked up a book, retreating to her dorm room. Seamus muttered that
she <em class="calibre9">was</em> in a mood; it just wasn't a friendly one.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry stopped in
front of his old locker. The words <em class="calibre9">'Harry Potter, Seeker,
Captain' </em>still gleamed brightly across the door. He reached out
and traced the letters thinking how awed he'd been the first time
he had seen his name etched there. It had been a lot further above
his head then. Now the words were at eye level. He shoved his hands
in his pockets and looked around at the semi-dark room. A lone lamp
flickered on one wall and Harry lit another before taking a look
around. One of Oliver's old battle plans leant against one of the
walls. It was covered in graffiti that Harry recognised as Fred and
George's writing. A banner hung limply above it, a Lion asleep in
the top corner. There were a couple of practice brooms leaning in one
corner. A pair of beaters gloves stuck out of the top of the locker
marked Peakes and a Quaffle sat on one of the benches.</p><p class="calibre8">A set of discarded
Quidditch robes were draped over the back of a chair. They hadn't
cleaned up very well after the match they'd played right after the
battle; the game they'd played for Fred. The house-elves obviously
hadn't done so either. There had been a lot to do at the castle it
was no surprise the Quidditch changing rooms were left uncleaned.
Harry sighed heavily as he picked up the robes and threw them in the
hamper in the corner. He stowed the Quaffle in the box at the bottom
of the broom cupboard before stuffing the brooms inside. As he
straightened the limp banner a practice Snitch lazily flew out of its
folds. Harry half-heartedly snatched at it but it darted out of his
reach and fluttered up to sit on top of his locker. Harry shook his
head; his earlier good mood dissipated, sucked away by the stale air
in the Gryffindor locker room with its memories of the last seven
years.</p><p class="calibre8">Well six really; he
had no memories from last year, Harry reflected bitterly. He sighed
heavily and flopped back on one of the benches and stared up at the
ceiling absently. The faint scent of sweaty bodies and unwashed socks
lingered in the air, embedded in the fabric of the room. The Snitch
fluttered lazily off the top of his locker and buzzed above his head.
Harry amused himself by watching it dart about as if tempting him to
jump up and catch it. His mind wandered back to Ginny. Harry cursed
himself for being too busy to stop and find out what was bothering
her. Chocolate fixed only some things.</p><p class="calibre8">Taking a deep
breath, Harry hauled himself off the bench and headed for the exit.
The Snitch flew past him as he put one hand on the door and he
snatched the whirling golden ball out of the air with his other hand.
A smile played on his lips as he let the door bang shut behind him
and stepped out onto the pitch.</p><p class="calibre8">Darkness was falling
and Harry knew that the chance of Ginny still being on the pitch was
slim but he just wanted to stand there for a moment. The wings of the
Snitch fluttered against his hand and he let it go, watching as it
flew off into the stands. Harry stared up at the hoops and listened
to the faded echo of years of games; the students cheering, the
players furiously battling for dominance. Suddenly Harry couldn't
imagine this properly fulfilling his life. Flying was his passion and
he and Ron had dreamed of being professional Quidditch stars.
Quidditch wasn't what Harry wanted any more. He didn't want to be
in the spotlight; the people cheering for him, constantly under
scrutiny the way sports stars often were. The idea was unsettling.
Harry wanted to do something where he could go about his life without
a camera in his face; something where he could help people.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry wanted to keep
fighting. There were still too many wrongs in the world. The Ministry
was still fragile and full of fear. The world needed to be made safe
for Teddy and all the other children who had been left without
parents by the brutal and bloody war. Harry fingered the Auror badge
in his pocket. Quidditch was brilliant but it wasn't where he was
supposed to be. Harry pictured the smiling couple in the Muggle
photograph on his bedside table and he heard his father saying they
were proud of him. He didn't have to do anything else – not to
make them proud; not to make their sacrifice a worthy one. One by one
the faded images of his parents, his godfather and Remus fluttered
through Harry's mind as he stood on the silent Quidditch pitch.
They weren't the real, almost solid images from the stone, just an
echo of his memory, unmoving and silent. Harry stared into the
distance. Would he honour Sirius's and Remus's sacrifice by
pretending his job was done? They were gone now and only Harry was
left.</p><p class="calibre8">Standing in the
middle of the empty Quidditch pitch Harry felt the enormity of being
alone. A breeze ruffled his hair, blowing away the last glimpses in
his mind's eye of his mother, father and godfather. The Snitch
winked back into his sight; it seemed to bring Remus with it until
he, too, faded back into the comfortable places in Harry's mind.
The last thing Remus said to him was that he tried to make a world in
which Teddy could be happier. Harry wasn't alone. Remus had left
Teddy behind and now it was Harry's job to make the world a happy
place for Teddy.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's you and
me, kid," Harry whispered to Teddy on the empty pitch. "We've
still got time to make our dads proud." Harry patted his Auror
badge; his decision made. He thought wryly that everyone else had
seen it coming before he did – seen what he would choose to do. He
didn't have to do anything anymore, but he wanted to.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry shivered as a
cool wind whipped around the stadium, the light breeze had been only
a warning that the wind was about to pick up. It wove icy fingers
through his hair and burrowed beneath his cloak, seeking to find its
way to his skin to suck out the warmth. Scanning the pitch for the
practice Snitch, Harry pulled his cloak around his body and squinted.
Unable to see more than a few feet in front of him in the gathering
gloom he pulled out his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Lumos</em>,"
he muttered, sweeping it in a wide arc in an attempt to find the
elusive golden ball. A sudden movement caught his eye. At first he
thought it was the Snitch but then he realised that the glint was
more red than gold; sitting up in the bottom row of the stands was
Ginny Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">She shifted slightly
as Harry's wand-light rested on her for a moment before he lowered
it.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Nox</em>," he
murmured. He stood uncertainly for a moment before turning to make
his way across the pitch and up to the spot in the stands where Ginny
sat. Harry lowered himself onto the seat beside her. The two of them
sat there, not touching, in silence, as the sky grew darker and the
stars began to come out.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're probably
missing dinner," Ginny said quietly after a long time. It was long
enough that Harry's fingers had gone numb and he could barely feel
his toes as he sat motionless in the stands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, what's a
little food here and there," shrugged Harry. "Food's
overrated."</p><p class="calibre8">"You never miss
meals," said Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"First time for
everything," replied Harry, feeling slightly desperate that he had
nothing more important to say. The Snitch whizzed by and Harry
followed it with is eyes until it vanished into the darkness. His
eyes rested on Ginny who stared across the pitch, unseeing, her eyes
glazing over. She looked lost and her teeth were chattering. Harry
pulled out his wand and cast a warming charm over them both, cursing
himself for not doing it sooner. It wasn't very effective but it
would be better than nothing since Ginny insisted on sitting out here
in the cold.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's getting
cold," he said unnecessarily. Ginny nodded absently. Harry twirled
his wand thoughtfully, peering at Ginny in the dim light. She stared
straight ahead, her hands relentlessly twisting in the hem of her
sleeves.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Lumos</em>,"
muttered Harry again, throwing the light on Ginny's face. She
flinched a little at the light but remained silent. "You've not
been sleeping properly." Harry saw the shadows under her eyes and
the glassy stare as he eyes looked vacantly over the grassy pitch.
Ginny shook her head slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I have a lot of
work to do," she murmured. Harry waited for her to continue but she
did not say anything more.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny …"
Harry trailed off. He had no idea what to say. Ginny turned to look
at him and shifted her features into a grimace that Harry was sure
was supposed to be a smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't want
to miss any more of dinner," she said. "If you hurry you could
get pudding."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not going
anywhere," Harry insisted. "Not without you. What is going on
Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing, I'm
fine," Ginny insisted, "taking a breather … just a bit busy
that's all."</p><p class="calibre8">"Busy with what?"
pressed Harry. She seemed oddly distant and he struggled to
understand what was going through her mind.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just … things
…" Ginny waved a hand vaguely in the direction of the castle.
"Don't worry about it." The frustration of the last couple of
weeks caught up with Harry and he ran his hand raggedly through his
hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry
about it?" he asked her incredulously waving his lit wand
erratically. "We've been through this. I get to worry, okay?"
Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"You have enough
to worry about," she said quietly. Harry made an exasperated noise
halfway between a sigh and a snort.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I do," he
ground out, "and right now one of them is <em class="calibre9">you</em>. You've been
moody and distant and snappy."</p><p class="calibre8">"Full of
compliments aren't you?" Ginny snapped. "Would you like to pass
comment on my hair or dress sense while you are at it?" Harry
groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why would I do
that?" he asked, not really expecting an answer. Ginny continued as
if he had not spoken.</p><p class="calibre8">"Still, I don't
know that I can expect anything more," she said bitterly. "You
<em class="calibre9">are</em> male." Harry gaped at her; never had Ginny been the type
of girl who exhibited such blatant sexism. He expected it from Ron
and George, the off colour jokes and the silly comments that didn't
really mean anything but this was entirely unexpected and completely
out of character.</p><p class="calibre8">"You always <em class="calibre9">liked</em>
that about me," he attempted a joke but Ginny wasn't laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"If I am so
unpleasant, why are you here?" she asked him pointedly. Harry shook
his head with resignation and cancelled the <em class="calibre9">Lumos</em>, plunging
them into darkness.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't say
you were unpleasant," he sad quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But I am,"
Ginny whispered. She sounded so lost and Harry couldn't bear it any
more. Risking physical injury, he pocketed his wand and reached out
to pull her to him. She resisted for only a moment before she wound
her arms around his neck with a sob and crawled into his lap. Harry
held her close while she cried, feeling the tension drain out of her
and her body going limp, moulding to his own.</p><p class="calibre8">He ran his hands
soothingly up and down her back and stroked her hair whispering
nonsense to her the way he did to Teddy whenever the baby fussed.
Harry pulled his cloak around the two of them, stretching it as far
as he could. He had no idea how long Ginny cried but he was almost
completely numb with cold by the time he realised she was breathing
the deep, even breath of sleep.</p><p class="calibre8">It was with
difficulty that he managed to get to his feet and shuffled down from
the Quidditch stands. He knew he could not make it back to the castle
carrying Ginny so he stumbled into the Gryffindor change rooms
instead. He didn't know whether to laugh or curse when he saw the
practice Snitch hovering by the door. It zoomed in when he pushed the
door open with his shoulder. He then suspected it had a Homing Charm
on it in case the training Seeker was really that bad at catching the
Snitch.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry lay Ginny down
on one of the benches and covered her with his cloak, using a set of
Quidditch robes snatched from his own locker as a pillow. Harry sat
down on the floor next to her and smoothed the hair back from her
face. Now that he had some measure of light he could see just how
pale she was. She was frowning slightly in her sleep and Harry traced
her features with his fingertips partly to remind himself what she
felt like and partly to smooth away the frown lines on her forehead.
That she had not woken during all the movement told Harry just how
tired she must be and how much sleep she had been missing trying to
catch up.</p><p class="calibre8">He bent to kiss her
softly and she whimpered as his lips left her skin, her brow
furrowing again. Harry stroked his fingers through her hair and
whispered to her until the lines melted away. He stayed there,
watching over her as she slept, knowing this was the first time she'd
slept properly in a while, the shadows under her eyes and her pallor
indicated she'd not been coping with something. Either she was very
good at hiding it or Harry really hadn't noticed. He felt ill at
the thought.</p><p class="calibre8">Maybe she had a
right to be mad at him. He had been rather busy. After the first few
days of awed admiration from afar the younger students had taken to
flocking around Harry like baby Thestrals around a piece of raw meat.
Harry made a silent list in his head of all the demands on his time
and realised that although she hadn't complained, Ginny had started
to slip further and further down the list.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione wanted him
to read books about werewolves, professors wanted his opinion on
various small problems and other students constantly asked him
questions. Seamus and Dean had engaged him in more than one activity
during his spare time and even Dora had probably gotten more time
than Ginny. How had so many people been able to put their demands
before her? Harry's heart clenched as he looked down at his
girlfriend. She looked so frail and small. He made a silent vow with
himself to be more attentive from now on and he started by sitting up
to watch over her while she slept.</p><p class="calibre8">*****************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry awoke slumped
over next to the bench on which Ginny lay, still sleeping soundly.
She looked a little more peaceful now, as if the sleep had worked its
magic and made her less careworn and more serene. He sat up and
rubbed his neck. It made a rasping sound in the stillness. He checked
his watch. They hadn't been asleep long; there was still time to
get back to the castle before curfew.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," Harry
said quietly. "Wake up." She mumbled a little and turned over.
Harry tried again and Ginny finally woke up and looked at him
blearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm mad at
you," she mumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said. "I didn't mean-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I'm sorry,"
Ginny interrupted, sitting up abruptly. "I shouldn't have taken
it out on you." Harry reached out a hand and ran it through her
hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been
busy," he said. "I didn't mean to … forget about you."</p><p class="calibre8">"You didn't,"
Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's been
going on?" Harry pressed when Ginny stopped talking. Ginny sighed
and looked down at her hands, her hair falling around her face. Harry
lifted himself up to sit on the bench.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just a bit of …
well, I have a lot of work to do and I was having trouble keeping
up," she said, still not looking at him. Harry raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's a
bit more than that," he said. "You blamed me for being <em class="calibre9">male</em>."
Ginny winced.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, I'm
sorry," she whispered. "I just … I didn't … sorry." Harry
reached out and pushed her hair back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," he
pleaded. "What is it, really? Dean's a fan of the um … hormones
theory but I know I isn't that." She looked up at him then.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm so far
behind," she said. "I don't think I learnt a single thing last
year. Now I'm trying to do seventh year and I didn't really do my
sixth." Harry hadn't even thought about that. Ginny continued.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna's all
right," Ginny stared absently at the Lion snoring on the banner.
"She missed half the year but not only did she spend the summer
studying but Neville's helping her. The Ravenclaws have got a study
group going in any case, for people who need a bit of catching up but
… I think the only person who missed as much school as me was
Neville and he got a sixth year – however badly it ended."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can help,"
Harry started. "Well … Hermione-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Has been busy
with you," Ginny smiled and put a soft hand on his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't be,"
Ginny said. "I know what you are both doing is important. I'm
just being selfish."</p><p class="calibre8">"No, you're
not," said Harry. He turned to face her directly, clutching both
her hands in his. "I have been preoccupied. I have been busy and
the younger kids … well they're over their shyness aren't they?
But none of it's been so important that I couldn't be with you.
When was the last time I told everyone else to bugger off so I could
spend time with my girl?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But Teddy-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Is safe now,"
Harry assured her. "You should have seen Hermione. She was
brilliant. Moses Brown tried to say how there was no way of knowing
if a werewolf offspring would be a werewolf and it was better to be
safe than sorry and Hermione just hauled out all these case studies
and some sort of genetic thing that Pomfrey signed off on for her as
being correct and ... well I didn't understand half of it but you
should have seen <em class="calibre9">Ron</em>. He just stared at her the whole time
with this goofy grin on his face. He kept turning to me and
whispering 'isn't she brilliant?' Like I don't know that, you
know."</p><p class="calibre8">"She convinced
them then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah," said
Harry enthusiastically. "Did you know that studies of werewolf
descendants are really sparse because, well … no one wants to admit
their parent is a werewolf – not with the bad rap they get.
Hermione found all these case studies that some Healer had done at St
Mungo's about how lycanthropy is transmitted and not a single
person ever inherited it. She blew that myth completely out of the
water with all these charts and graphs and things. Everyone who is a
werewolf is one because they were bitten and infected. Old Moses
didn't know what hit him.</p><p class="calibre8">"He tried to claim
something about how it runs in families and that's when Hermione
just hit him between the eyes. 'Of course it would!' she says,
'because no one does anything for werewolves except shun them. How
many werewolves get out and hurt their own families because there is
no support for Wolfsbane or assistance to contain them appropriately
in their own homes?' I'm telling you Ginny, she was brilliant; it
was like watching an artist or something.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not only did she
prove that lycanthropy isn't inherited, but she made a case for
werewolf rights and treatment as well! Kingsley is sure to offer her
a job after this. She would be brilliant arguing cases before the
Wizengamot, but I reckon she wants to advocate first. Probably go to
the Department for Magical Creatures."</p><p class="calibre8">"She's going to
try and make us join Spew again isn't she?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Merlin, I hope
not."</p><p class="calibre8">"It sounds like
everything went well then," Ginny mused. "Bill must be pleased."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, erm, not as
such," Harry squirmed. "Hermione did a fantastic job proving
lycanthropy isn't inherited, but the Wizengamot probably wasn't
convinced that those attacked like Bill and Lavender aren't going
to turn. The fellow from the Department for Magical Creatures made it
sound like Hermione's facts about transmission meant people like
Bill and Lavender were about to turn into werewolves."</p><p class="calibre8">"So, they still
want to lock Bill up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, nearly half
the Wizengamot," admitted Harry. "But they can't. It didn't
pass. Brown's not giving up, though. He managed to get some sort of
thing passed to inspect medical records or something. They're
'still investigating', whatever that means."</p><p class="calibre8">"Poor Bill,"
murmured Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll say. He
looked furious," Harry said. "Fleur calmed him down. I do <em class="calibre9">not</em>
want to know what they were going to do when they got home. I swear
she was all over him like a rash like she used to be, that summer at
the Burrow." Harry shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well at least
they're entitled, I suppose," Ginny muttered, her face darkening.
Harry looked at her sideways.</p><p class="calibre8">"Entitled?"</p><p class="calibre8">"To shag," Ginny
replied shortly, throwing his cloak off her legs and standing up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm …" said
Harry eloquently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Some of us are
not, and should not be entitled to such … behaviour," Ginny
muttered as she straightened her clothing. Harry gulped. She knew
George had been encouraging him and somehow, she'd seen into his
head and knew Harry wanted to act on the increasingly intense
thoughts he kept hidden there. Someone must have been teaching her
Legilimency.</p><p class="calibre8">"Absolutely," he
murmured, standing up and trying to look innocent, "definitely
not."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh don't give
me that," Ginny glared at him, arms crossed. "You knew and you
didn't say anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"Knew?" parroted
Harry; he was a bit confused because they'd talked about George and
his bet. "Of course I knew. <em class="calibre9">You</em> knew I knew." Ginny rolled
her eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you never
said anything to me," she huffed. "What do you mean I knew?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We talked about
it that day on the stairs," stammered Harry. He remembered telling
her George was running a book, that George was … encouraging.</p><p class="calibre8">"You haven't had
more than five minutes for me all week and you used every single one
of them to try and grope me," Ginny accused. "When did we ever
talk about this?"</p><p class="calibre8">"In the summer,"
Harry sighed. She had to know, he wasn't exactly … subtle about
things, not the way his body reacted towards her. It was almost as if
she was talking about something or someone else.</p><p class="calibre8">"The summer?"
Ginny almost screeched. "This has been going on since summer?"
Harry stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, yeah," he
shrugged, thinking back to all he had endured that summer regarding
his intentions. "There were a few rough patches and a couple death
glares but George is fine with it now."</p><p class="calibre8">"George?" echoed
Ginny. "George is <em class="calibre9">fine</em> with this now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well, he
is," Harry insisted. "Ron is not so much. He knows it's
inevitable but I think he's fighting it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron knows as
well?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, sort of,"
Harry glanced away. "He doesn't know all the details, that'd
just be too weird."</p><p class="calibre8">"And I suppose
Bill knows too?" scoffed Ginny. "And probably Percy and Charlie
as well; I knew it was too good to be true, it's some sick male
game that you play!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't be daft!"
Harry exclaimed. "There's no way Percy's heard about it, but,
yeah I think Bill and Charlie ... George told them something, not
sure what exactly. They've not been openly hostile; which is a
good thing."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you'd
think Bill would have more sense," grunted Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not like
he doesn't understand-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Understand?"
Ginny looked at him incredulously. "How could <em class="calibre9">anyone</em>
possibly understand this?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a
perfectly normal reaction and you've never minded before,"
pleaded Harry. This was not going at all how he'd hoped. He was
trying to get closer to her, not turn her off him for good. Ginny
didn't appear to be listening to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Never have I met
such complete insensitivity from those bunch of … of … galahs
before!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Galahs?" Harry
raised an eyebrow. "Picked up some of the Australian slang, huh?"
Ginny glowered at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stay on topic,
Potter," she said coolly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry," he
muttered, immediately penitent. "Look, it doesn't mean anything-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well that's
just lovely," said Ginny sarcastically. "What if it means
something to <em class="calibre9">her</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it does
mean something, but it's something good," Harry tried
desperately. "It's flattering … to get that sort of reaction
from a bloke." Ginny stared at him as if she was going to bore a
hole through his skull.</p><p class="calibre8">"Flattering?"
she screeched. "You believe this sort of carry on is flattering?
Which cave did you wander out of?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" Harry
protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"At least Bill
married his fling, I suppose," Ginny muttered angrily. "I'm not
sure he waited but at least he had enough respect …"</p><p class="calibre8">"If you want to
wait until we get married, that's fine," babbled Harry. "In
fact, your dad suggested it and he's very smart, your dad. We
should probably take his advice." Ginny stared up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you
completely insane?" she asked him. "You honestly think I am going
to wait much longer?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But …" Harry
sank onto the bench and absentmindedly began to fold his abandoned
cloak. "You just all but told me I have a filthy mind. I don't
mean to think about you that way, it just happens. It's been
happening for nearly two years and I can't just switch it off. I
don't even know what switched it on. It's probably your hair …
or your smell. I love the way you smell and I love watching you fly.
I wish I could have watched you fly today. You look brilliant on a
broom and your hair just streams out behind you and it's like a red
streak across the sky and when you've finished you always look all
flushed and excited like flying and Quidditch are the best things in
the world.</p><p class="calibre8">"Flying <em class="calibre9">is</em>
the best feeling in the world, but I don't want to do that, I'm
going to be an Auror, but you probably knew that. Everybody knew that
except me I think. But oh, I want to see you fly. I could spend
almost all my time just watching you fly. You're so graceful and
the way you throw the Quaffle with your gorgeous hands and I want to
spend more time with you because I love how your feet fit so
perfectly on the ends of your legs – not that there is anything
wrong with your legs, but Merlin, one of the best things about living
at your house is watching you walk around barefoot. It's sort of
intimate, you know. I mean you don't just walk around without shoes
on in front of anybody. I've missed your feet, and I know that
sounds silly but I can't help it.</p><p class="calibre8">"See, now you
know, I've secretly been harbouring feelings for your feet and
that's just all kinds of weird. I can see why you'd be entirely
grossed out. To hear that revelation on top of finding out exactly
what goes through my head while I'm kissing you or if I think of
you. Yes, I even think it while I am looking at your feet – oh, no
wonder you've been pissed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," said
Ginny calmly, although she looked rather flushed. "I think perhaps
<em class="calibre9">you</em> are pissed. Have you and Ron been at the Firewhisky?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't want to
switch it off," Harry told her desperately. He stood up and took a
step towards her nervously. "I can control myself, I swear."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know you can,"
Ginny murmured, rolling her eyes. "Did it ever occur to you, Harry
that I don't want you to control yourself?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But you … you
said there are people who aren't entitled to it," insisted Harry.
"I know, and I'm sorry, but you can trust me I won't ever-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh rubbish, you'd
better!" Ginny launched herself at him and he found her lips on
his, her tongue tracing delicate patterns on his mouth. Harry gave in
with a groan. He'd missed her so much and he cradled her tenderly
even though he wanted nothing more than to run his hands over her and
memorise every inch of her for later.</p><p class="calibre8">He could hear Ginny
make a funny little noise in her throat and he trembled, wanting to
pull her closer, revelling in the feel of her, the smell of her. He
pulled back to place kisses on her cheek, her ear, down her neck …</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, and to think
I blamed all of mankind for George's stupidity," Ginny suddenly
sighed as her fingers clutched at Harry's shoulders. "And I have
been missing out on this …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Wait," said
Harry, lifting his head. "What has George's stupidity got to do
with anything? He runs books on everything, which may not be the
strictest of morality, but he's hardly responsible for my
depravity."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hmpf," Ginny
grunted, using her hands to guide Harry back to her neck. "It's
not your depravity that concerns me, it's George's."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't think
about George," muttered Harry. "Just … just …" but what he
had been about to say he had no idea because Ginny chose that moment
to press herself against him in an attempt to attack his neck with
her lips and his mind went blank. He came back to himself only after
he'd lifted her up and pushed her against his locker door. Harry
lifted his head and drank in the sight of her, cheeks flushed and
lips swollen. He could feel the warmth where she had clasped her legs
around his waist and her skirt was pushed alarmingly high on her
hips. Harry flushed as he realised he'd been stroking his hands
along her thighs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't …"
muttered Ginny, "don't stop …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Wait," Harry
said, trying to catch his breath and calm his racing heart. "Hang
on, why is George stupid?" Ginny moaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't want to
think about George and Angelina," she murmured against his neck,
her fingers tangling loosely in the hair at the base of his neck.
Harry pulled back with a gasp and with some effort settled Ginny's
feet on the floor. She wasn't very compliant but she must have
sensed he was struggling with something and stood in front of him,
her head tilted to the side questioningly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have you been
talking about George and Angelina," he asked, "the whole time?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Ginny's
eyes narrowed, "what did you think I was talking about?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought … I
figured you must have … oh hell," groaned Harry. Ginny giggled.
She began tracing the outline of his collarbone.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on," she
wheedled, "tell me." Harry's breath hitched as her fingers
found his pulse and then strayed southward again.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought … I
thought … youweretalkinaboutme," he said as quickly as possible.
Ginny raised an eyebrow. Harry took a deep breath and made the effort
to speak slower. "You said that some people shouldn't be entitled
to shag. Well, its pretty much all I've been thinking about lately
and … well ..." He gestured lamely at nothing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have you been
thinking about shagging, Harry Potter?" asked Ginny, grinning
mischievously. Harry threw her a dark look.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you know
about George and Angelina?" was all he said. "How did you find
out?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, so you do
know?" Ginny crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I do, and
believe me; he got a not-very-pleasant lecture about his behaviour
from Bill," Harry retorted. "I got it too, and believe me he did
<em class="calibre9">not</em> go easy!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well," huffed
Ginny. "I got an Owl from Angelina on Thursday."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," Harry
gulped and then tried to continue nonchalantly. "I didn't know
you and Angelina were friends." Ginny rolled her eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"She was my
Quidditch Captain once upon a time," she said silkily. "Something
happened to her Seeker and I replaced him and we became quite good
friends." Harry smiled sheepishly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … well, I
knew that. It's just-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Girls are
different, Harry," Ginny said shortly. Harry nodded and remained
silent. "So she and George had an interesting weekend and then he
took off. No note, no word, no contact for two days after they shared
something so wonderful she was willing to <em class="calibre9">tell me</em> all about
how good <em class="calibre9">my brother</em> is at the act of sexual intercourse. I'm
telling you, Harry, he's practically a god." Ginny rolled her
eyes. Harry shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right, I get
the picture," he said hastily.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what's he
playing at then?" demanded Ginny suddenly. "Since you know so
much about it, perhaps you can explain it to me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it's
because of Fred," Harry began, running a hand through his hair.
"She's Fred's girl."</p><p class="calibre8">"Was," said
Ginny shortly. "Fred's dead." Harry winced.</p><p class="calibre8">"George took
advantage of her," Harry sighed. "You should have heard him talk
about her. You should have seen him. It was like there was a sort of
peace that came over him when he was thinking about her and he even
said it; when he was with her he felt whole. He knows he took
advantage of the fact he looks like Fred though. It was like … like
he grabbed at her because she made him feel, less alone, I suppose.
She knows how he feels; she's the only one who knows."</p><p class="calibre8">"And he thinks she
doesn't want him?" asked Ginny slowly. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"He feels awful
because, well they were drunk and he took advantage of her," he
sighed and turned away. "Bill really did have a chat with us, you
know. I think George is starting to realise he has to pull himself
together before he makes more monumental stuff-ups like that one. I
don't think he has the courage to face her and apologise, yet."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, but it wasn't
a stuff-up," cried Ginny. Harry turned to face her again. "It
wasn't, Angelina knew exactly what she was doing. She said she felt
alive for the first time in ages; like she wasn't just marking time
until her own death. She was only drunk the first time! The rest of
the time she knew exactly what she was doing, she didn't want it to
end and George, that idiot, just upped and left. You know what she's
thinking? That George is regretting the whole thing! All she wants is
him because he can make her feel whole again. She's devastated."</p><p class="calibre8">"So … they feel
the same way?" Harry drew his brows together. Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"She wanted to
make a new start," she said quietly. "When George walked out
without a word, without a note, he broke her heart all over again. I
could see tear stains on the parchment. She wanted to make a new
start but she's angry right now because he walked out on her. If he
walked in the door tomorrow I don't think she would know whether to
hug him or hex him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Whole thing's a
mess," muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"And that is
exactly why some people aren't entitled to shag," added Ginny.
"They can't be trusted with their-" Harry covered her mouth
with his own. He did not need her to finish that thought.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny responded
eagerly and it wasn't long before Harry found himself backed
against his locker, his shirt somewhere on the floor and his glasses
askew. Somewhere, dimly, in the back of his brain, he realised Ginny
had given him the green light to act on all those delicious dreams.
His hands had crept halfway up her back, under her shirt and her
hands had strayed to his belt when he began to push back until they
reached the bench again and stumbled into it, falling over
ungracefully. Harry scraped his shins and Ginny lay half on the
floor, half on the bench, holding her head and her skirt around her
waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um … maybe …
that is," stammered Harry. He stopped, unable to form a coherent
sentence. Ginny opened her eyes. She swung her legs down and sat up
gingerly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Find your shirt,
Harry," she said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Just find your
shirt," she repeated through gritted teeth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay," Harry
replied softly, aware that the moment was probably over.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is the
Quidditch changing room," Ginny muttered, getting to her feet and
pulling her skirt down. "I'm pretty sure I don't want to …
experience this for the first time in a smelly room full of Quidditch
gear. I mean I know we both love Quidditch, but …" She looked up
at him shyly. Harry had pulled his shirt on and was fumbling for the
buttons when small hands stopped his progress.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,
Ginny," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't do it
up," Ginny said, smiling, running one soft hand inside his shirt
and up his chest. "If you leave it open it'll save time."</p><p class="calibre8">"But, you just
said you don't want to keep going," protested Harry. "And that
is fine, perfectly fine."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't say
that," smiled Ginny, sliding her hand around his neck and pressing
against him. "I said not in here."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," said
Harry. "You want to … go find somewhere, um, now?" He looked
down at her hopefully. Ginny nodded and pressed a kiss to his lips.
He smiled against them and kissed her back thoroughly before grabbing
his discarded cloak in one hand and hers in the other. Dousing the
lamp and plunging the room into darkness, Harry shouldered his way
out of the changing room and pulled Ginny back towards the castle.
She giggled as she trotted along behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're very
keen," she observed, giggling harder. Harry turned and looked at
her closely in the dim light cast by the moon and stars.</p><p class="calibre8">"If this is too
fast …" he trailed off, overcome once more with doubt and
confusion. Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
second-guessing, Harry," she said. "Just act." Harry didn't
answer her, only dragged her back to the castle faster.</p><p class="calibre8">They reached the
great oak doors of the Entrance Hall, panting with exertion and
flushed in spite of the chill air. Harry checked his watch, they
still had a few minutes to go before curfew and he pressed a hand to
the door to open it. He had only opened it an inch when a shout
reached their ears. They both turned to see George, stumbling up the
path, practically dragging someone with him.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry rushed down to
help him, fearing the worst. When he got there he realised George was
practically carrying Hermione up the path to the castle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, thank
goodness I caught you," puffed George. "Here." He thrust
Hermione into Harry's arms. Harry stumbled under her sudden weight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh! Harry!
Hello!" Hermione grinned up at him and looped her arms around his
neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's a little
…"</p><p class="calibre8">"Inebr-inee-neeb …
I'm pissed, Harry!" Hermione flung one arm into the air and let
out a loud shriek of laughter. Clearly she found it very amusing.
Harry didn't. He found himself very off balance as he tried to stop
her from tipping over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can you take care
of her? I have to get back to Ron," muttered George. "I left him
in the Shrieking Shack throwing up onto his shoes."</p><p class="calibre8">"You came through
the passageway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," nodded
George, "it's a good thing it wasn't blocked!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay… well be
careful going back past the Whomping Willow," Harry called back
dejectedly as George jogged off into the night. Harry shook his head.
He sighed heavily, feeling deflated. It was <em class="calibre9">not</em> good timing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?" a weak
voice came from somewhere below his chin. "Harry, I think I'm
going to vomit." Harry managed to point Hermione away from him and
toward a garden bed just in time. Ginny padded up behind them as he
was rubbing Hermione's back softly with one hand and holding her
hair back with the other as she leaned her forehead against the
ground, groaning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is that,
Hermione?" Ginny asked incredulously. Harry nodded blithely.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think she and
Ron may have gotten a little too much 'Happy Birthday,'" he
grimaced as Hermione retched again into the rose bushes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Harry,"
Hermione moaned, "I think we drank too much."</p><p class="calibre8">"No kidding,"
muttered Harry, draping one of her arms over his shoulders and
turning back to the castle. "Try not to spew until we get you up to
the bathroom."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not spew."
Hermione tried to stand up straight and failed. "It's S.P.E.W.
and I don't like Myrtle's bathroom. There are <em class="calibre9">cats</em> in
there."</p><p class="calibre8">"We're not going
to Myrtle's bathroom," muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where are we
going?" Ginny asked worriedly as she pushed the door open for Harry
to drag Hermione into the Entrance Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Prefect's
bathroom," Harry said shortly, directing Hermione away from a suit
of armour.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" Hermione
protested loudly, pointing aggressively back at the plinth as she
wrestled against Harry's firm grip. "I was talking to him!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhhhhh!"
Harry clamped a hand over her mouth. "D'you want to get caught?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Noooooo," said
Hermione solemnly, her blood-shot, glassy gaze becoming doe-eyed and
innocent. "We do <em class="calibre9">not</em> want to get caught. Harry, we almost
never get caught … remember that time we got caught on the
Astronomy Tower?" She giggled. Loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhhhhhhhh!"
Harry hissed desperately. Hermione threw her arms out and spun
around.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't deny it,
Harry!" she trilled. "Hey everybody, guess what? I was up on the
Astronomy Tower with <em class="calibre9">Harry Potter</em>!" Hermione started
laughing uproariously. Harry slapped one hand over her mouth before
grabbing her arms and steering her towards the bottom step. Ginny
raised one eyebrow at them as she pulled Hermione up onto the first
step of the Grand Staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was in our
first year," huffed Harry. "I was <em class="calibre9">eleven</em> and we were
delivering Norbert to Charlie's mates!" Ginny giggled and yanked
Hermione's arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" protested
Hermione. "I can walk on my own." Harry shook his head and
resumed pushing her up the stairs while Ginny dragged from in front.
They got to the third landing before Hermione spoke again.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is the third
floor, Harry!" she whispered, spinning around and clutching his
shirt. "We're not allowed in the third floor corridor … Why is
your shirt undone?" She tugged at his collar and peered underneath.</p><p class="calibre8">"Never you mind,"
said Harry, hastily clutching at his shirt.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's no
Horntail!" Hermione gasped suddenly and turned to Ginny, an
accusatory look on her face. "<em class="calibre9">You </em>said he had a Horntail
tattoo!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
definitely one for reliving the past on Firewhisky," Ginny said.
She rolled her eyes expressively and tugged the other girl up the
next few steps and onto the fourth floor landing.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't like
Horntails!" Hermione proclaimed suddenly. She turned to Harry, wide
eyed. "A Horntail tried to <em class="calibre9">kill</em> you! Are you okay? Do need
to see … to see, um … Madam Poff … Madam Poof … Madam Pump …
the matron?" Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I'm fine,"
he said. "A few more steps and we're at the bathroom."</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you coming in
the bathroom with me?" Hermione suddenly lowered her eyelashes and
giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," he said
shortly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, come on,
you've done it before," Hermione pouted, giggling. Harry rolled
his eyes exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on," he
muttered, giving her a shove. Hermione turned to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"It didn't mean
anything," she slurred, suddenly seeming to run out of steam. "We
<em class="calibre9">only</em> made Polyjuice potion, in the bathroom with the snake
tap, you have to believe me!" Ginny patted her arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, I know,"
she soothed as they stumbled the last few steps to the Prefect's
bathroom. "Here we are, let's get you cleaned up."</p><p class="calibre8">"I had a lovely
birthday," Hermione sighed as Ginny opened the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's great,
Hermione," mumbled Harry as he propelled her into the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm going to
join the Ministry when I've finished Hogwarts," said Hermione,
"and Harry's going to be an Auror, he's my best friend and so's
Ron, he's my boyfriend … wow, I have a boyfriend. I never had one
before."</p><p class="calibre8">"What about Viktor
Krum?" Ginny asked mischievously as she pushed Hermione onto one of
the seats.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pfffft,"
snorted Hermione with a languid wave of her hand. "He wasn't my
<em class="calibre9">boyfriend</em>. I never did with <em class="calibre9">him</em> the things I do with
Ron!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well enough
of that," said Ginny briskly. "I already know far more about
George's sexual prowess than I ever needed to, I do <em class="calibre9">not</em> need
to hear about Ron's!"</p><p class="calibre8">"How's Harry's?"
Hermione suddenly asked, lurching out of her seat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Merlin,
Hermione," Harry exclaimed. "Drink loosens your tongue doesn't
it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Have you done it
yet?" Hermione asked him, swaying to one side. Harry shook his head
resignedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"And I wouldn't
even be telling you that much if I thought you'd remember this in
the morning," he muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I'm going
to be sick," said Hermione and she promptly threw up all over
Harry's shoes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lovely," Harry
said sarcastically, screwing up his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just take them
off," Ginny sighed, unfastening the clasp on Hermione's cloak.
"I'll send them to the House Elves with her clothes."</p><p class="calibre8">"She won't like
that," Harry removed his shoes with a grimace.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, next time
she might be considerate enough <em class="calibre9">not</em> to get drunk while I'm
busy finding out about your sexual prowess." Harry blushed and left
the room hurriedly as Ginny started to remove Hermione's shirt.</p><p class="calibre8">It was late by the
time Ginny got Hermione cleaned up and sober enough to walk up the
dormitory stairs. Harry sank into his four-poster and gave himself up
to some very pleasant, but ultimately frustrating dreams.</p>
