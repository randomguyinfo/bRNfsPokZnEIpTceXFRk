<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_2">*Chapter 1*: Chapter 1</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Mourning Fred</strong></p><p class="calibre8">As Harry
cracked his eyes open he noticed that the sun was creating the same
reddish glow he'd seen before he'd gone to sleep. Through the
blur he couldn't be sure whether this was because the sun was
setting or he just hadn't been asleep for very long and it was
still daybreak. As he stirred himself to reach for his glasses a
rustle broke the silence and he heard Ron speak.</p><p class="calibre8">"About
time mate! I thought you were going to sleep all of today as
well!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shush Ron! It's barely dawn!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sat
up, startled. He seemed to be in his dormitory judging by the blurry
red hangings on the four-poster he was in. By the colour of the
light, he judged it was dawn. Hermione most definitely should not be
in his dormitory at dawn.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I am
so glad you're awake, Harry!" said Hermione. Her beaming face
came into view as Harry located his glasses and hastily shoved them
onto his face. She was definitely in his dormitory at dawn. "Mrs
Weasley's going to barge in here and wake you herself if you didn't
wake up soon. I think she wants to feed you."</p><p class="calibre8">"How long
have I been out?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just a day; it's morning
again, but you'd better hurry up. I don't know how much longer
Kreacher will be able to hold mum off." </p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher?"
he asked, wondering why the house elf would want to hold off anyone
from feeding him. His stomach grumbled rather loudly, as if in answer
to his question.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
he's determined to ensure that no one disturbs 'Master Harry',"
explained Ron. "He's like a little sentinel at the bottom of the
boys' staircase. Dad had to conjure sleeping bags for all the boys
to use in the common room. Kreacher only let us up here after half an
hour of Hermione persuading him. Ginny was not impressed."</p><p class="calibre8">As Ron
explained all this Hermione tactfully retreated behind a rather large
tome allowing Harry to emerge from his bed and rummage about for his
robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is anyone else up yet?" he asked. He was hungry
and not particularly interested in talking with anyone before
breakfast.</p><p class="calibre8">"Apart from Mum, nope," said Ron. "We could
go now and avoid everyone else. Breakfast should be on in the Great
Hall any minute now. Reckon Mum's right. You look a bit peaky,
could do with some fattening up." Ron eyed Harry critically and out
the corner of his eye Harry saw Hermione raise her eyebrows as she
gazed at him as well. He sensed their next question and stiffened
before Hermione spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"Exactly how did you convince
Voldemort you were dead Harry? I mean you look bad, but not that
bad," she asked. Harry could almost see the cogs turning in her
head. Her eyebrows were drawn together the way they did when she was
working on a particularly tricky Arithmancy problem and she'd
narrowed her eyes as if inspecting </p><p class="calibre8">him under
some sort of microscope.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gee, thanks Hermione." Harry
didn't want to discuss it right then, especially not with Hermione
in the analytical mood she was probably in – given the way she was
tapping her finger on her leg. She did that when she was trying to
solve a problem lately. Harry didn't know whether to be grateful it
gave him a clue or annoyed because it was a truly irritating habit.
He didn't think he could take analysis on an empty stomach. Ron
seemed either to sense this or was equally unwilling to discuss
anything on an empty stomach and Harry did not miss the look he and
Hermione exchanged as Harry hesitated.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't
want to talk about it," he mumbled and lapsed into a broody
silence. When his and Ron's stomachs rumbled in unison, Harry
sighed and headed for the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'd best rescue your mum
from Kreacher then … or will we be rescuing Kreacher from her?"</p><p class="calibre8">But Mrs
Weasley was not in sight as they exited the boys' staircase into a
common room strewn with sleeping bodies. Harry saw Mr. Weasley
surrounded by Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Charlie. He gathered that Mrs
Weasley and Ginny were in the girls' dorms and wondered briefly
where Fred and George were before he remembered that Fred was gone
and couldn't be there. Not even the sight of Neville, Seamus and
Dean curled up together under one of the study tables next to the
window could shift the melancholy feeling that settled in his
stomach. Dennis Creevey was huddled in the foetal position near the
dormitory stairs. As he stood there, gazing at Dennis's tear
streaked face, Kreacher bounded into sight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Master Harry!
Master Harry! You've been asleep for so long, you need to eat! If
you don't eat you'll fade away into nothing!" Kreacher launched
into a seemingly endless rant and began pushing and pulling Harry
towards the portrait hole.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dunno
why we were worried about mum trying to feed you up. He's got her
beat!"</p><p class="calibre8">As they
got to the portrait hole Harry noticed the occupants of the room
begin to stir.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop, stop Kreacher! I'll go and have
breakfast gladly, I'm hungrier than a hippogriff but let's go to
the kitchens, all right?" Harry didn't want company and he knew
the occupants of Gryffindor tower were probably only some of the
castle's occupants who would seek him out if he went to the Great
Hall for breakfast. Kreacher acquiesced and promised to go on ahead
and arrange for food while Harry, Ron and Hermione made their way
more sedately down to the painting and tickled the pear to gain
access to the kitchens.</p><p class="calibre8">The kitchens seemed busy and quiet
all at the same time. It was as if the house elves who busied
themselves preparing mountains of food were far off in the distance.
The area by the fireplace was an oasis of calm in comparison. Just
before he sank into a plush armchair in front of the fire Harry
noticed they weren't alone. Sitting in a chair just to the left of
the glowing embers and cradling a steaming mug was George. Harry
froze in his tracks. An icy fist clenched his heart and the dull
feeling from the common room moved up from his stomach and settled
around his heart making his </p><p class="calibre8">chest
ache.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's up mate?" Ron asked Harry. His voice
shattered the stillness and George looked up. Harry could see the
tear tracks that streaked through the dirt and dust still on his face
and as he gazed at them his eyes filled and tears began dripping down
his cheeks once more. Hermione pushed past Ron and Harry and
approached George, kneeling in front of him.</p><p class="calibre8">"George," she
questioned softly, "would you like us to go?" George shook his
head carefully but did not speak as his face began to crumple and his
hands began to shake. Hermione carefully extricated the mug from his
hands and set it on the hearth before folding George into a hug as he
began to weep loudly on her shoulder. Ron strode quickly over to
them, crouching and pulling them both into a hug, his tall frame
overwhelming both the other two, shorter figures. Harry wasn't sure
what he should do but before he could decide anything he heard
footsteps behind him. Turning, he saw Bill and Charlie walking
backwards watching Percy's attempts to extricate himself from the
portrait frame through which they had come. He was having little
success and appeared to be stuck.</p><p class="calibre8">"I really don't know how
you two knew how to sneak into the kitchens," he was muttering.
"Really I would have expected better; Prefects, both of
you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't look at me, Percy. I was a model student,"
insisted Bill. "I had no more idea than you! Ask Charlie how he
knows!" Charlie raised his hands in mock surrender.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seriously
Perce," said Charlie, "I was at Hogwarts with the twins for two
years, they might not have confided in you, but how long do you think
it took them to find the kitchens?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred found the door
handle first term," said George hollowly. Bill and Charlie started
and spun around while George's voice appeared to jolt Percy free
from the portrait frame. The effect was the same as if George had
been standing behind Percy and pushed him through. Percy fell onto
the stone floor with a thud.</p><p class="calibre8">"George, Mum's been looking
for you," said Bill softly, joining Ron, George and Hermione in
front of the fireplace. He nodded at Harry and Ron. "I think she'll
be relieved we found you lot as well. Hermione, can you go and tell
her we found you all, so she can stop worrying?" Hermione nodded,
carefully extracting herself from Ron and George. Harry moved to
follow her when Charlie shot out an arm, detaining him. Harry raised
his eyebrows at him but Charlie only shook his head imperceptibly and
then jerked his head in Bill's direction. Harry followed Charlie
and Percy to the fireplace where Bill conjured another two chairs and
produced a bottle of Firewhisky from a pocket in his robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
am I going to do Bill?" George asked plaintively, turning a tear
streaked face towards them. Percy's protest at the production of
alcohol died on his lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"We toast," said Bill. "We
drink to our brother and give him the best send off he could have …
and then we rebuild and we go on. We go on living for him. We make
this world something worth dying for, and we never forget him. Ever.
That's what you're going to do."</p><p class="calibre8">As he
spoke, Bill conjured six glasses, handed them around and began
pouring Firewhisky into each one. Ron held out an arm to George,
hauling him to his feet. George composed himself a fraction and
raised his glass.</p><p class="calibre8">"To rebuilding, to living, to brotherhood,
to Fred."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
it little brother, get that down," Bill said as he pulled Harry
down into a seat. Harry's throat burned and his eyes stung but he
wasn't sure if it was from the Firewhisky or because of what Bill
had said.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt
a warm glow as he looked around at his companions and he knew that it
had very little to do with the Firewhisky. The six of them passed the
morning in front of the fireplace in the kitchen. They were fed
copiously by solicitous house- elves and polished off the bottle of
Firewhisky while they shared outrageous stories about Fred.</p><p class="calibre8">"Remember
when he was trying to start the car, Ron?" said George. "He was
half asleep and kept refusing to start it because he thought it would
be too noisy!"</p><p class="calibre8">"That
was the whole point," chortled Ron. "We had to start the car to
make it fly and go and get Harry." Ron was a little inebriated and
nearly fell off his chair as he tried to throw an arm around Harry's
shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"He was
a good driver though," sobbed George. "He made it all the way to
Surrey and back." Ron nodded carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Remember
that time he made my Head Boy badge say 'Big Head Boy'," said
Percy and it sounded for a moment as if he considered that to be a
fond memory. "He was so smart." As Percy dissolved into
Firewhisky induced tears George sat up straight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!
That was my idea!"</p><p class="calibre8">Bill told
a story that none of the others could remember involving baby Fred,
six spoons and a bucket of dirt and Ron recounted all the times Fred
had turned him blue, pink or into a toad. At one point Harry wondered
dimly why Mrs. Weasley hadn't come to fetch them, Hermione seemed
to be taking an awfully long time but he was distracted in his
musings by Charlie who had broken a lull in the conversation.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
about the time Fred stuck me to the ceiling," he said taking a swig
from his glass. "Damn good spell that and he taught it to Ginny.
That might come in very handy for our little sister. It's a good
place to stick the boys that are bothering her."</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred
told me the other day he had a great idea about what to do next time
Ginny admits to having a boyfriend," confided George. "She's
been avoiding that question all year. Fred was really close to
getting it out of her too. I could feel it! No idea how long it'll
take us now, we'll have to start from scratch." Harry froze and
Ron burst out laughing. Charlie looked thoughtful.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do
you think he was going to do to the bloke, George?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No
idea, I think it involved fireworks and enclosed spaces though,"
replied George. "Always had a fondness for fireworks did our Fred."</p><p class="calibre8">Bill and
Charlie nodded as if this were a perfectly acceptable solution to a
small insect infestation while Ron caught the look on Harry's face
and simply laughed harder. For his part, Harry began to sink as far
into the plush chair as he could manage, trying to remain completely
inconspicuous and wondering how he was going to escape.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
really don't think Ginevra is going to go for this idea fellows,"
said Percy slowly, enunciating every word carefully. Harry thought
Percy might possibly be drunker than the rest of them put together.
"If she finds out you are plotting anything she'll Bat Bogey you
in a heartbeat."</p><p class="calibre8">George
conceded that this may very well be a valid point and the Weasley
brothers sank into a contemplative state with Ron punctuating the
silence with muffled laughter that none of them, in their drunken
stupor, thought to question.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think she's got a
bloke right now though?" Charlie broke the silence. "I mean it's
been a bit of a rough year, lots going on. Maybe we've got time to
prepare? Our plans could be executed swiftly if we have a little time
to prepare."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
sprayed a mouthful of Firewhisky over an unsuspecting George and some
stray droplets caused the fire to flare up. Suddenly Harry was as
sober as a judge and looked rather fearfully at the five fully grown
wizards he was sitting with. Make that four. Ron hardly looked
fearsome as he renewed his vigorous laughter rolling on the
hearthrug.</p><p class="calibre8">"You all right there Harry?" asked Bill
solicitously. "Mum'll probably kill us if we get you two really
pickled. Come to that Fleur might have a bit to say to me …"</p><p class="calibre8">Amidst
gentle ribbing about his married status Bill motioned his brothers to
their feet, vanished the glasses and the extra chairs and slung an
arm around George. As he led George back to the door of the kitchen
Harry swore he heard Bill say that they would finish Fred's last
work and find the slimeball going out with Ginny and deal with him
good and proper. Ron's laughter echoed throughout the kitchen and
as the portrait swung shut Harry heard Percy ask Ron if he hadn't
flipped his lid completely and what on earth was so funny.</p><p class="calibre8">There
was no way Harry was going anywhere near those
boys.</p><p class="calibre8">He wasn't sure exactly
how long it was until he heard the painting swing open and Mr Weasley
entered. He scanned the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah there you are Harry,"
said Mr Weasley. "Seems Ron was right, you've not gone far after
all. Got the womenfolk in a knot upstairs there."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry Mr Weasley," Harry apologised. "I didn't mean for anyone
to worry."</p><p class="calibre8">"The boys thought you were with them,"
explained Mr Weasley. "But considering they are a wee bit tipsy …
well, I'm not surprised they didn't realise you weren't there.
They're carrying on something shocking about ferreting out 'the
slimeball' and defending Ginny's honour. I'm really not sure I
want to know about that." Mr Weasley said all this
conversationally, as if his sons getting drunk and seeking revenge on
slimeballs who sought to dishonour their sister was an everyday
occurrence.</p><p class="calibre8">"They want to finish the project Fred was
working on before he died … er, identify Ginny's latest boyfriend
and finish him off," explained Harry. "Um … I really couldn't
be a part of that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I'm sure they'd welcome your
help there Harry. They see you as their brother, you know," said Mr
Weasley and Harry thought he heard a hint of humour in the other
man's voice but when he looked Mr Weasley seemed old and weary, the
wrinkles at the corners of his eyes etched deep on his pale face.
There was very little humour in his face and he looked like a man who
had the weight of the world on his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd not be
so sure about that if they knew," muttered Harry. He paused and
watched as Mr Weasley stood there looking into the fireplace. "I'm
sorry Mr Weasley, about Fred. I – I …" He trailed off, unsure
what he was trying to say, unsure what he wanted to say.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know, son," said Mr Weasley gently, the grief on his face becoming
more prominent. "I know. Now I came down here to let you know
you've got a visitor. Best come up and see."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was
not at all keen on entertaining visitors and wondered briefly if he
could avoid it, but the look on Mr Weasley's face stopped him. It
was clear that he should go and see this visitor and so he wearily
rose from his chair and moved towards the portrait frame that marked
the doorway leading from the kitchen back to the halls of
Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?" He turned back at the sound of Mr
Weasley's voice. "Thank you, son, thank you." Harry just looked
sadly at him and nodded before climbing through the kitchen entrance
to go and greet his mystery visitor.</p>
