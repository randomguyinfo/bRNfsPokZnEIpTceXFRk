			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Dad</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Ron and
Harry pulled pillows over their heads when they heard pounding on
their bedroom door the next morning. From beneath a mound of blankets
Ron pointed his wand at the door and locked it. Dimly, Harry thought
he heard Hermione on the other side. He pulled the covers up over the
top of his pillow. He and Ron both forgot that this was Hermione they
were trying to keep out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
open up!" she shrieked as the door blasted itself off its hinges.
Ron poked his head out of the blankets and looked at her warily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi,
you'd better fix that! We can't go about with no door!" He
missed the gleam in Hermione's eyes that Harry saw as he emerged
from his own covers.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you need a door for? Afraid someone might ogle you? All the way up
here? Come on, get out of bed!"And Hermione swished and flicked her
wand, levitating Ron's covers off him and out of the open doorway.
They landed on Ginny who was coming up the stairs to see what all the
fuss was about.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
clutched desperately at his own covers while Ron blushed furiously
and grabbed a pillow to place over his lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
getting up, I'm getting up, just … get out first … and fix our
door!" Harry nodded furiously in agreement with Ron as Hermione's
wand wavered over to his bed. Her hand twitched and his covers moved,
exposing his chest and he grabbed at them furiously, scowling at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
stop it, both of you. We shared a tent for months. I've seen
plenty!" huffed Hermione. Ginny had extricated herself from Ron's
bedclothes and reached the bedroom, throwing the covers back at Ron
who grabbed at them gratefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
view was it Hermione?" asked Ginny, her eyes twinkling with mirth.
Hermione winked at her and then turned back to Ron and Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
both of you, get your scrawny bums downstairs in five minutes," her
eyes were sparkling. "I've got news!" She turned to go down
the stairs and Ginny grinned at a red-faced Harry and Hermione pulled
her downstairs, waving her wand at the door to repair it as she went.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!"
yelled Ron after them, "our bums are not scrawny!"</p><p class="calibre8">The
boys burst into the kitchen a few minutes later, half dressed in
jeans and t shirts but without having donned shoes or brushed their
hair, Harry still trying to evade Ron's demanding questions about
his derriere.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly
Ron!" he said exasperatedly. "I don't know if your bum is
scrawny! How would I, it's not <em class="calibre9">your</em> bum I spend my time
looking at!" He blushed vividly as the entire kitchen went silent
at his admission. Harry was ready to sink through the floor but he
noticed Ginny was smiling into her breakfast.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
well, I have news!" said Hermione after a lengthy pause. "I have
a letter from Kingsley and he has managed to prod along the paperwork
and an owl should be arriving tomorrow with all the travel details.
We can leave for Sydney the day after tomorrow!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Brilliant!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
we can if we can get a portkey. I don't really know how long it
will take until we can get one booked. It might take a few weeks,"
Hermione clarified.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
let's book it today then," said Harry biting into a piece of
toast.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
did try to get in touch with the Department of Magical Transportation
and make an appointment with the Portkey Office but they were
singularly unhelpful," complained Hermione. "Apparently no one
can see me today. I suppose Saturday isn't a good day."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
really don't understand why they wouldn't at least make an
appointment," said Mr Weasley. "Ethelda Sutton is normally such
a good natured woman, although she always has been a bit of a gossip.
I expect they are overrun just now. No doubt everyone's looking to
travel now the war is over. Saturday shouldn't make a difference;
everyone's working around the clock at the moment getting things
back to rights. I'm going in for a few hours myself today."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you mean 'she's a bit of a gossip' exactly, Mr Weasley?"
asked Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
you know one of those witches always in a flap about the latest
celebrity on the cover of Witch Weekly," said Mr Weasley. "She's
always talking about that sort of thing. Opens all her conversations
with 'Did you hear about so and so? Got themselves into a right
state on the cover of this here magazine…' It can be terribly
tiresome. She swore to us she saw Dixon Brinley in the Portkey Office
once. As if he would deign to come in and organise his own portkey.
Honestly she's always been completely turned by celebrities."</p><p class="calibre8">"Dixon
Brinley? Who on earth is that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The
male answer to Celestina Warbeck," shuddered Ginny. "Parvati's
been dead keen on him for ages, have you never heard her say anything
about him?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I have been a bit busy worrying about things other than wizarding
world celebrities," said Harry a bit more sharply than he'd
intended. Ginny looked stung. Harry sighed. "I'm sorry; I didn't
mean that the way it came out."</p><p class="calibre8">"So,"
said Ron, swallowing a piece of bacon, "all we need is a celebrity
to soften up this Ethelda and we're booking a portkey so fast we're
out of here before you know it."</p><p class="calibre8">"We
could drag Lockhart out of St Mungos," mused Ginny. "He's still
daft enough we can simply tell him what to do, surely?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
about Kingsley," said Mrs Weasley, "Surely he could do
something?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Would
the Minister of Magic be celebrity enough for her, you reckon?"
asked George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
I couldn't bother Kingsley," protested Hermione. "He already
pushed through all the travel paperwork."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
what's the point of knowing high profile types like Kingsley if you
don't use that to your advantage?" asserted Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
more into the sensational type of celebrity that makes the front
pages," mused Mr Weasley turning the front page of the Daily
Prophet.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
just shook his head as he watched the picture of himself on the front
of Mr Weasley's paper wave at the camera. The headline said <em class="calibre9">'Harry
Potter Makes Eighteenth Birthday'</em> and the small blurb
underneath proclaimed his birthday celebrations so secret this paper
had not been able to find out what they were but they hoped he'd
had a good day.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
got up, and went to the fireplace. He threw a large pinch of Floo
powder in and stuck his head into the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ethelda
Sutton's Office!" His head spinning madly, Harry felt a bit ill
when his head finally stopped whirling and he found himself looking
directly up at a rather squat witch in pale blue robes. She was
staring at him as if her eyes were about to fall out of her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello!"
said Harry cheerfully. "Do you think I could make an appointment to
arrange an International Portkey booking? I know you're awfully
busy, but if you could just squeeze me in?"</p><p class="calibre8">'Y-you're
H-Harry P-Potter," the witch stuttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
I am, you <em class="calibre9">are</em> Ethelda Sutton, aren't you?" asked Harry.
The witch nodded dumbly at him but did not speak. At last, his knees
going numb, Harry asked, "is eleven o'clock a good time?" She
nodded so Harry said he'd see her then and pulled his head out of
the fireplace.</p><p class="calibre8">"Eleven
o'clock, Hermione," he said as he shook the ash from his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cor,
how did you manage that, Harry?" asked Ron in awe. "Hermione was
saying that Portkey witch was most unpleasant to her." Harry rolled
his eyes and taking Mr Weasley's discarded paper he thrust the
front page under Ron's nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
the point of knowing sensational front page celebrity types if you
don't use that to your advantage?" Harry snatched up a piece of
toast and banged out of the back door, going to sit on an old tree
stump at the edge of the garden. He contemplated the garden gnomes as
he ate. Harry finished his toast and decided to degnome the garden.
He heard Ginny approaching as he picked up the third gnome and hurled
it over the hedge.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
really am sorry," he said as he caught a fourth gnome, "about
before. I didn't mean to sound so snappy." Harry flung the angry
gnome over the hedge.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
okay," said Ginny softly. She paused. "Ron feels a bit stupid
about what he said about using high profile people to our advantage."
Harry looked at her startled. She continued. "He wanted me to come
out and talk to you first, reckons I'll soften you up a bit before
he has to have a go at apologising."</p><p class="calibre8">"He
thinks I'm angry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
well you did leave pretty abruptly and you're throwing gnomes like
you've just spent an hour in detention with Snape." Harry dropped
the gnome and it bit him on his bare foot.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ow!"
yelped Harry and he swore violently. "I'm not angry. Not with any
of you. It feels a bit weird though to use my fame like that though.
I never do that. Maybe I'm a bit angry at myself; for that, and for
snapping at you. I'm sort of pleased with you lot though." And he
looked ruefully at his foot which was bleeding copiously from the
gnome's bite marks.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pleased?"
asked Ginny as she moved to take a look at his foot. "Better come
inside and let mum fix that up." The two of them started back to
the house, Harry leaning on Ginny a little as he hopped along.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
pleased," reiterated Harry. "Not one of you even thought of me.
Sitting there discussing high profile, front page celebrities, and
there is my picture, on the front page of the daily paper and you
start wondering if you can get hold of Lockhart or about Kingsley.
That's brilliant is what that is." Ginny smiled up at him from
under the arm he had draped around her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you're just Harry, aren't you?" Harry smiled at her and wrapped
his other arm around her shoulders before leaning in to give her a
kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Weasley tutted about the state of Harry's foot and healed and
bandaged it. Then she pushed him into a chair and made him sit with
his foot elevated for an hour. Ron had laughed at the fact that he
would defy Voldemort but be cowed by his mother.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
shush, Ron," said Hermione briskly. "He likes being mothered,
leave him alone." Harry blushed, embarrassed, and stuck out his
tongue at Ron who reciprocated and they were both scolded by Mrs
Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
one would know you two are eighteen," Hermione sighed as she went
upstairs to gather some documents for the appointment at the
International Portkey office.</p><p class="calibre8">At
precisely eleven o'clock Harry and Hermione arrived at Ethelda's
Office door. It had been an interesting journey through the Ministry
and Harry was rather glad Hermione had insisted that they leave early
as he had been waylaid by some ten different people as he tried to
make his way to Level Six. He'd been detained in a lift all the way
to Level Two and finally managed to extricate himself from a well
meaning wizard who just wanted to shake his hand – for ten minutes
– to find Hermione had located Mr Weasley who was able to guide
them back through the Levels and back up to Level Six in straight to
the door of the Portkey office without further delay.</p><p class="calibre8">The
door swung open at Hermione's knock to reveal the same squat witch
in pale blue robes that Harry had seen earlier. She also appeared to
be as star struck as she had been before. When Hermione asked her
about booking an International Portkey to Australia as soon as
possible, Harry had to repeat the request before Ethelda came out of
the trace she was in. The first available Portkey to Australia was
not until seven o'clock in the morning the following Friday. So it
was virtually a week away but not even Harry could change the
International Portkey schedule. After booking the necessary Portkeys,
Harry and Hermione bade Ethelda goodbye and made their way back
through The Ministry.</p><p class="calibre8">Once
back on the streets of London Harry had a sudden thought.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
Hermione," he said as he stopped suddenly on the street outside the
phone box, "how long do you think we'll be gone?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
really don't know, Harry," she replied thoughtfully. "It could
take a couple of days to get to Yackandandah from Sydney. I've been
able to find out precious little about Australian Magical
transportation and we'll arrive on Friday. We may not be able to
travel until after the weekend, so it might take us until Monday or
Tuesday to arrive there. I think we're looking at a week, I
wouldn't count on being home before the eleventh."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,"
was all Harry said and began walking along the street. Hermione
caught up to his thought process pretty quickly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
no," she exclaimed hurrying up alongside him. "What about Ginny's
birthday?" Harry nodded and stopped in the middle of the footpath,
holding up several Muggles who huffed as they stepped around him.
Hermione grabbed his arm and pulled him across the street.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on, let's go somewhere and figure this out," she said. "Next
question, Grimmauld Place or the Leaky Cauldron?" They decided to
go to Grimmauld Place as it was also a good chance to check out what,
if any damage had been done to it by Voldemort's minions.</p><p class="calibre8">They
found that Number Twelve was structurally sound but the Death Eaters
had obviously had a field day redecorating the inside. They obviously
weren't all completely stupid and had managed to dismantle Moody's
curses but half the staircase was missing, most of the wallpaper in
the hallway scorched off and the kitchen not at all as gleaming as
Kreacher had left it. A falling beam from the dilapidated staircase
narrowly missed their heads and they quickly decided head to The
Leaky Cauldron instead.</p><p class="calibre8">When
they entered however Harry was entirely unsure if that had actually
been the wisest course of action. Half an hour later he made it
through the pub to the bar, having shaken at least thirty different
hands along the way, some of them more than once. He was reminded of
the first time he came there with Hagrid. Tom greeted them warmly and
tried to give them a Butterbeer on the house. After Harry had
convinced him to let him pay he and Hermione sat at a little table in
the corner. The table was so tiny their knees bumped and when they
leant their hands on the table their fingers were touching. They did
mange to get a few words out before their conversation was abruptly
stopped.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
will the Weasleys say if we are in Australia for Ginny's
seventeenth birthday?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
so you are running off to Australia then? The two of you?"
Hermione's face paled as she stared at the person behind Harry's
head. Harry recognised the voice. He did not want to turn around and
then a camera flash went off. Harry groaned as Rita Skeeter pulled up
a chair and situated herself at their tiny table.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
how long has this been going on then?" asked Rita sinuously, her
ghastly Quick Quotes Quill hovering behind her left ear. "Heading
off to Australia are we? Romantic rendezvous away from it all?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
as a matter of fact, not so much," said Hermione firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
a bit fickle, aren't you, Harry," said Rita, ignoring Hermione
completely. "It was just six weeks ago you were spotted
conspicuously with Miss Weasley, was it not? What does she have to
say about your abrupt change of heart?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
haven't had a change of heart," protested Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
since fourth year then?" nodded Rita in what Harry assumed she
thought was a knowing way. "You've forgiven her for the dalliance
with Krum then, or are the two of you still rivals?" Harry looked
at Hermione desperately, a look that Rita obviously mistakenly
interpreted as a look of love as she began gushing about their
unhidden passion for each other and the veritable fairytale ending
this was to the tale of Harry Potter.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
hardly the end of my life!" Harry exclaimed. He indicated himself
and Hermione, "and we're not going out! We never have!"</p><p class="calibre8">"How
does it feel to be the most eligible bachelor in the wizarding world,
Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not eligible," said Harry grumpily. Rita's eyes lit up and he
regretted ever opening his mouth; to say anything to her at all.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you are off the market then? I say again, does Viktor Krum know you
have won the heart of Miss Granger?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,
I think we need to go now," muttered Harry. Hermione nodded
feverishly in agreement and they both hastily stood up and edged away
from Rita Skeeter who was following them, her acid-green quill
scribbling furiously in her wake as she screeched after them to
enquire if Hermione was still using love potions. Harry and Hermione
dove almost headfirst into the fireplace and left her far behind.</p><p class="calibre8">As he
tumbled out of the kitchen fireplace in The Burrow Harry stumbled on
the edge of the hearth and landed, sprawling on the kitchen floor
just as Hermione came through and tripped over him, the pair of them
lay stranded on the kitchen floor as they caught their breath. George
wandered in as they lay there, panting.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
have you two been up to then?" he asked. "You look like you've
been running from some of Hagrid's half breed creations."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
far wrong," muttered Harry. "Which publication do you expect
we'll have to keep our eye on, Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Better
keep a look out on the Daily Prophet and Witch Weekly I suppose. It's
going to be horrible, isn't it?" Harry grimaced and nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you think we need to warn Krum?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably
best." At that moment Fleur came bustling in from the living room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
do you need to warn Viktor?" she asked curiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Rita
Skeeter," answered Hermione and Fleur nodded sagely.</p><p class="calibre8">"What'd
she do?" asked George eagerly. Hermione explained the way she'd
ambushed them.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
so there's bound to be an article full of incriminating pictures
and all sorts of terrible lies and probably something about me
breaking Viktor's heart this time," she finished exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">The
Daily Prophet, unable to find out anything about Harry for weeks now
and frustrated by their inability to uncover his birthday party
secrets had obviously decided to print Rita's idea of truth
instead. Three days later the front page sported a rather large
photograph of Harry and Hermione, squashed into their little table at
The Leaky Cauldron and the Headline</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">LOVE HAS LONGEVITY</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">The
recent hiccup in their romance not withstanding, it seems that the
love affair between Harry Potter and the rather plain Miss Hermione
Granger is not yet over. Spotted in London recently making plans for
an overseas getaway the couple appeared cosily in love as they
planned their upcoming trip to Australia.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Harry
Potter, wizarding Britain's most eligible bachelor, has denied that
tag, stating very clearly to this reporter "I'm not eligible."
Could it be, perhaps that this trip is more than a simple holiday and
perhaps an elopement? It appears that Mr Potter's interest in the
Weasley girl is no more than a passing fancy, or perhaps she too used
the Love Potions which made Mr Potter so attached to Miss Granger
during her undoubtedly less than enchanting years at Hogwarts. It
appears that Miss Weasley did indeed use illegal means to obtain her
desires.</em></p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">She
had him completely bewitched, you know," says Miss Romilda Vane,
one of Miss Weasley and Mr Potter's Hogwarts classmates. "I mean
one minute she's got more boys than you can count twisted around
her little finger and the next she's got Harry Potter snogging her
in front of everyone. That's just not like Harry at all. She had to
have bewitched him. I expect she slipped it to him in some food, or
chocolates or something."</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">So
could it be that all along it was Miss Weasley using the Love Potions
to secure herself boyfriends and not Miss Granger. Perhaps Miss
Granger and Mr Potter have a relationship that has simply withstood
the test of time and betrayals that all other dalliances are mere
rumours or red herrings? Viktor Krum doesn't seem to think so.</em></p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">We
had a very good time when we were together," says Mr Krum, of his
relationship with Miss Granger during what was her fourth year at
Hogwarts. "She was a bit at odds with one of her male friends at
that stage though. I do not think he approved." Undoubtedly the
male friend to which he refers is Mr Potter. One can only assume that
such a good time with another is what led to Mr Potter seeking the
affections of other girls, for a time. One such girl reassures us
that he is definitely not interested in her now. Miss Cho Chang says
she once kissed Mr Potter and they enjoyed a brief relationship but
that it was always undermined by Hermione Granger, lurking there in
the background. She speculates that Miss Granger kept young Mr Ronald
Weasley also dangling as he was never seen with any other girls until
his sixth year. </em></p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">It
is entirely possible," says Chang, "that Lavender [Brown]
obtained some of the Love Potion Ginny Weasley was brewing. They were
after all, in the same house at Hogwarts." Investigations by this
reporter reveal that Mr Weasley is indeed going with the couple to
Australia. Is he the witness to their secret wedding or is there
something more to their threesome than meets the eye?</em></p><p class="calibre8">"Imagine
if she got hold of the fact that we spent most of last year alone in
a tent together, some of it without Ron," sniffed Hermione as she
threw the paper down on the Weasley's kitchen table. "If she can
twist Viktor's innocent words like that what can she do with
something that actually does look questionable!" Ron snorted into
his breakfast and said something that sounded suspiciously like
'innocent, ha!' Hermione fixed him with a glare.</p><p class="calibre8">"There
was nothing questionable about the tent, Hermione," said Harry
exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I know that and you know that and Ron knows that, but would Rita and
the rest of the world believe that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
point," said Harry gloomily as he stabbed his eggs with a fork. The
three of them were alone in the kitchen, Mrs Weasley having gone to
rouse Ginny from her bed right before the Daily Prophet had arrived.
The three of them sat picking at their breakfast morosely when the
fireplace flared to life and Viktor Krum's head appeared in the
flames.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello
Viktor," said Hermione listlessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hullo
Herm-own-ninny," said the head in the fireplace. Ron snorted.
"Hullo Veasley, Potter."</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
yeah, hi," stammered Ron blushing.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am
sorry about that article. That voman has tvisted my vords."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
worry about it Viktor, she twisted ours too," said Harry, sighing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Vell,
should you like I take care of her?"</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
choked on her bacon.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you mean take care of her?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
cannot be allowed to get avay vith this!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
always gets away with it!" Ron said. "What are we supposed to
do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Vell,"
mused Viktor, "in my experience it is better to refute such things
rather van let them go on. You should make a statement." He swung
towards Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me?"
Harry squeaked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
you," said Viktor definitively. "Clear up the rumours, convirm or
deny the trip to Auztralya, clarify your statement that you are not
eligible. Vat does zat mean, anyway? You are unmarried, yes?" Harry
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
only eighteen! What on earth makes her think I am even thinking of
getting married?" he said exasperatedly. "Who gets married at
eighteen anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
did, dear," said Mrs Weasley as she came back into the kitchen. "Oh
hello Viktor dear!" she said as she noticed his head floating in
the fireplace. Harry backpedalled quickly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
that there's anything wrong with someone getting married at
eighteen of course it's just, well I don't know anyone who did,
or I thought I didn't and well I couldn't…" he trailed off
uncertainly and Mrs Weasley smiled at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
why are you discussing marriage anyway Harry?" she enquired as she
bustled about the stove. Harry blushed to the roots of his hair; Ron
looked shiftily at the floor while Hermione tried to surreptitiously
hide the morning paper.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
shall be going then," said Viktor from the fireplace. He looked at
Harry. "Get a press representative." Then he was gone.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you need a press representative for dear?" said Mrs Weasley
briskly as she brought another plateful of piping hot bacon to the
table just as Ginny and George entered the kitchen behind their
father. The three newcomers slid into their seats just as Mrs Weasley
spotted the edge of the Daily Prophet that Hermione had been trying
to slide under her plate. Hermione wasn't quick enough and Mrs
Weasley pounced on it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
good, it's finally arrived. Tuesday is household cleaning tips
day," she said briskly as she rifled through the pages, completely
ignoring the front page. Unfortunately this meant she held it up for
the rest of the table to look at. George let out a low whistle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
she got you two a good one. Lovely photo," he said. Ginny looked up
from her eggs and promptly spat them out all over the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really
Ginny," said Mrs Weasley as she lowered the paper, "you shouldn't
eat so fast if you're going to spit everything out like that."
Ginny said nothing but snatched the paper from her mother, smoothing
out the front page. Harry and Hermione watched her warily while Ron
took another bite of toast and then waved the half eaten piece in
Ginny's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a load of rubbish," he said unnecessarily. Ginny finished reading
it and glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know that, dunderhead," she snapped, "but just you wait until I
get my hands on Romilda Vane!" Mrs Weasley was peering at the front
page as Ginny read it. As she finished the article she tutted and
shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
woman," she huffed. "Viktor does have a point though, perhaps you
do need a press representative; someone to refute these ridiculous
claims." Harry sighed and ran his hands through his hair before
resting his head in his hands. Mr Weasley took the paper to have a
closer look. He frowned as he read through the article.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you do need to say something," he eventually said. "She's got
you eloping to Australia! And what possessed you to say you weren't
eligible?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was practically the only thing I even said to her and … well I'm
not!" protested Harry hotly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Perhaps
you don't think so," said Mrs Weasley gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
witches will consider you eligible until you've got a ball and
chain, Harry," said George. Ginny and Hermione glared at him.
George continued, "and some of them will probably still consider
you eligible." Harry sighed again. Ron groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"
asked Harry. "What now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
open any mail!" Ron barked at Hermione. "Even if it's addressed
to you; especially if it's addressed to you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
not, Ron? I'm still waiting for my Hogwarts letter. I just has to
get here before we leave."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you can open that one," conceded Ron grudgingly, "but don't
open any others."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
not, Ron?" asked Hermione impatiently. "You can't tell me what
to do!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
it'll probably be hate mail, won't it?" reasoned Ron. "D'you
fancy pus-filled fingers again?" Hermione subsided. Apparently she
saw his point. Mr Weasley stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
to worry, Harry," he said. "I'll have a chat to Kingsley today
see if we can't sort this out. Okay I'm off now, see you all
tonight!" He kissed Mrs Weasley on the cheek and left out the back
door to Apparate to London. Ron and George left soon afterwards for
Diagon Alley. They planned to open the shop as soon as they returned
home from Australia, so there was a fair bit to do.</p><p class="calibre8">It had
turned out that the whole reason Harry and Hermione had stopped in
The Leaky Cauldron to discuss Ginny's birthday was a non issue for
her family. Ginny had been excited to spend her birthday in a
different country and although Mrs Weasley had been reluctant to let
her go at first she soon realised that with most of her brothers away
she wouldn't have a particularly festive birthday at home with
Percy and her parents in any case. She sighed and said Ginny could
still go and they'd have a special birthday dinner when they all
got home. This kept things on a tight schedule to ensure all was
ready for their departure and Hermione soon chivvied Harry and Ginny
upstairs to finish packing.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
aren't leaving for three days, Hermione!" protested Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can't leave everything to the last minute, Ginny!" huffed
Hermione. "No wonder we are always late leaving for Hogwarts!"
Harry gave Ginny a rueful smile as Hermione pushed Ginny into her
bedroom and sent Harry up to pack his own things. Ginny evidently
packed in record time, managing to satisfy Hermione, because it was
only a short while later that Harry looked up from sorting his
laundry to find Ginny slipping in the door. He hastily shoved the
underwear in his hands behind his back. Ginny laughed as she threw
herself on Ron's bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've
seen it before, Potter," she smirked. "Who do you think helps my
mother with the laundry?" Harry sighed and inspected the contents
of his hands before tossing it into the laundry basket near the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
not the point," he grumbled good naturedly as he continued sorting
his socks.</p><p class="calibre8">"Haven't
you finished packing yet?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I have not, it's not everyone can be as speedy as you Miss
Ginevra," he replied as he shook out a pair of maroon pyjamas that
he realised were actually Ron's. Ginny took a good look around the
room then and sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
two live in a pigsty. You know that don't you?" she said
conversationally. "Hermione never warned me about that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
it's not me who lives in a pigsty, it's Ron!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can't fool me Harry; I know that particular pile over there," she
pointed to a rather untidy heap by the wardrobe, "is <em class="calibre9">yours</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
how do you know Ron didn't <em class="calibre9">put</em> it there?" he smirked at
her as he wadded up a pair of jeans and lobbed it into his bag. Ginny
rolled her eyes at him and climbed off the bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly
Harry, is that how you always pack?" she asked as she began to pull
all of the contents from the bag on Harry's bed. Harry started to
protest and then sighed heavily before slumping onto his bed,
defeated.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
no you don't Potter, I'm not doing this while you laze about
doing nothing! Go and sort out that festering pile over there, we
need to get this stuff cleaned if you are going to take it with you,"
she began sorting through the items on his bed and discarding most of
them into the laundry basket.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
it took me ages to pack all that!" protested Harry, swiping at a
pair of boxers as they sailed through the air towards the basket.
"And how do you know those are dirty?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
assume," Ginny stated loftily. "I can see I shall have to train
you if you ever wish to call yourself not eligible." Harry studied
her intently before asking softly,</p><p class="calibre8">"You
think I'm eligible right now?" Ginny looked up at him startled.
"Because I'm not. I haven't been for over a year. I've been
yours. I'll always be yours." He studied Ginny who stood
motionless, a pair of socks covered in Snitches dangling from her
right hand. She blinked at him, and looked down at the socks in her
hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not -" she broke off, hesitating. "I hadn't really thought
about it … dreamed maybe, but not serious thought." She put the
socks back in the bag, mechanically following them with a pair of
matching boxers and folded the jeans Harry had wadded up moments
before. Harry put out a hand to stop her, causing her to look up at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
might not be getting married, or even engaged, heck I'm not even
planning to get engaged right now, but that doesn't make me
<em class="calibre9">eligible</em>," he reached over and took her hand, forcing her to
drop the jeans she was holding. "I might not be planning to get
engaged but I know who I'm planning to marry. She already has my
heart. I'm not eligible for anyone but her." He heard Ginny
swallow audibly as she stared at him. Her eyes were wide and he could
see the pulse beating erratically in her neck. He lifted his other
hand to touch it and with his fingertips resting on her pulse he
pressed a feathery soft kiss to her lips. He pulled back slightly but
found his lips captured once again as Ginny launched herself at him.</p><p class="calibre8">He
could feel her arms around his neck, her lips as they played across
his own, her hair as it caressed his arms as he wound them around her
waist. He opened his mouth willingly as she demanded entrance, her
tongue dancing over his teeth and lips. He felt her familiar warm
hands slide down his back and then creep up his shirt. His own hands
traced patterns up and down her back as her tongue found his and as
she stroked it with her own he realised his hands had moved south,
travelling over new, curvy territory and he was pressing her hips to
him as he began to chase her tongue back into her own mouth. The kiss
that she had so boldly started had turned the tables on her and
blindly Harry backed her towards Ron's bed and they fell on it in a
tangled heap. Harry reached out to break his fall but did not break
the kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">His
hands moved back down to grasp Ginny's hips before travelling back
up her sides, finding more new curves, and he melted bonelessly onto
her. There was a distant bang as she tangled her feet with his and
her own hands travelled to unexplored territory, pressing his hips
closer to her own. Harry wasn't embarrassed this time when he
realised that it was his reaction that had prompted her boldness.
Neither of them saw the door swing open as they lay on Ron's bed
kissing fiercely, Ginny's hands caressing Harry's considerably
less than scrawny bum and his hands pinning her beneath him as his
mouth plundered hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a good thing I'm not her mother." Hermione's voice broke
through their passion. Indeed it cooled it considerably. Harry broke
off the kiss and they both sat up hurriedly, straightening their
clothing as Hermione continued, dropping a clean pile of laundry on
Harry's bed as she did so. "Equally, I am sure you are more than
relieved I am not Ron either. He'd have something to say about that
sort of activity on his bed, I'm sure. Now if you could finish
packing?" She left, taking the dirty laundry basket with her as she
went.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bet
Ron wouldn't have a problem with it if he was the one doing it with
<em class="calibre9">her</em>," muttered Harry. Ginny giggled nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
right. It's a good thing she wasn't mum." She stood up and
began nervously folding the jeans she had dropped earlier, refusing
to look at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,"
said Harry as he scrambled off the bed, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have lost control like that. It's just I … I'm sorry." He
raked his hands through his hair as Ginny stuffed the jeans into the
bag. She finally looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Harry," she said, "don't be sorry. I'm not. A trifle
embarrassed that Hermione walked in on us perhaps, but not sorry."
She gazed up at him and the light from the window cast a glow on her
face that made him catch his breath and he leaned down to kiss her
softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"One
day," he whispered, "one day I will marry you and the whole world
will know I'm not eligible. Right now maybe only you know it, but
that's enough." Ginny looked more than a little flushed but she
smiled at him and reached out a hand to stroke his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'd
better get packing then so we live long enough to make that dream
come true," she said. "Hermione will be back in a minute to
supervise. I am sure she doesn't trust us at all now." Sure
enough only a few minutes later Hermione was back to make sure they
kept busy packing rather than busy with each other but she couldn't
stop them sneaking longing glances at each other as they finished
packing Harry's bag and began straightening up the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre8">*******************</p><p class="calibre8">Wednesday
night at The Burrow Mrs Weasley started running through a checklist
of things to ensure that everything had been done for their trip.</p><p class="calibre8">"Laundry
all done?" she asked briskly. Harry and Ginny stifled giggles while
Ron looked at them strangely and Hermione glared at them.</p><p class="calibre8">"All
done Mrs Weasley," she replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"Toiletries
packed?" They all nodded. "Paperwork?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really,
Mrs Weasley," said Hermione, "everything has been taken care of.
All we need do is show up to the Portkey at the right time and we're
set. Bill and Fleur have a separate Portkey for convenience but we
should arrive in Sydney at around the same time, late afternoon
Friday."</p><p class="calibre8">"And
you know where your Portkey is?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Stoatshead
Hill, same as for the World Cup."</p><p class="calibre8">"Money!"
said Mr Weasley suddenly. "Have you got enough money? If you're
arriving in the middle of a Muggle airport I expect you'll need
some Muggle money. Oh you'll be able to find out how planes stay up
won't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
hadn't thought about that," cried Hermione in alarm as if
forgetting anything at all was a crime. "We'll have to go
tomorrow and change some Galleons at Gringotts. Do they do exchanges
to Australian dollars there?" Mr Weasley nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"They'll
exchange anything at Gringotts. Don't know how fair the exchange
will be."</p><p class="calibre8">"How
will we know how much to exchange," fretted Hermione. "I did a
bit of research about it but it's very confusing because all the
exchange rates changes so frequently and I don't know how much
we'll need. I suppose we'll have to convert it to pounds first
and then dollars, or do you think they'll go straight from galleons
to dollars? They do use galleons in Australian wizarding society,
don't they? I hadn't even thought!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Calm
down Hermione," said Harry as he swallowed a forkful of treacle
tart. "It's not an issue anyway. I said I'd go and see Teddy
tomorrow before I left but just take Ginny with you, change whatever
you think we'll need and then some. Grab some extra galleons too so
we don't have to worry about wizarding money either, okay?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
Ginny got to do with it?" asked George. Harry didn't answer and
shoved another forkful of treacle tart into his mouth. Eventually
Ron, throwing an evil look at Harry, replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry
gave her access to his family jewels. She can go down anytime she
wants." Harry aimed a hard kick at him under the table and glared
while George paled and looked at Harry suspiciously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
beg your pardon?" he asked. Ginny was glaring at Ron, blushing to
the roots of her hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"My
vault, George, relax," said Harry. He smiled wryly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Got
you a beauty though," beamed Ron. "That's payback, that is."
George threw a dinner roll at his head and looked pointedly at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
well, just you see that she doesn't have access to anything else!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Must
we discuss this at the dinner table?" asked Mrs Weasley fretfully,
looking frantically to Mr Weasley for support. For his part Mr
Weasley was buried in some parchment he had pulled out as soon as
he'd finished his own treacle tart and only nodded along absently
to the conversation going on around him. Ginny suddenly exploded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Must
we talk about this at all? Why is it any of your business anyway?"
she demanded. "What I choose to do in my sex life has got nothing
to do with you!" Mrs Weasley looked frantically at her husband and
slapped his arm to get his attention.</p><p class="calibre8">"Say
something Arthur!" Mr Weasley looked up to see Ron and George
glaring at Harry who was bright red and Ginny who looked as furious
as anyone had ever seen her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
yes, she's quite right," he said forcefully, clearly not wishing
to get on the wrong side of his daughter who was evidently working up
a head of steam.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
have got to be joking, dad!" exclaimed George. "She can't just
… they can't … and you're letting her go off to Australia
with him!" Ginny leapt out of her chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
do you know what we do? It's none of your business!" she
screeched. Mr Weasley looked puzzled. It was obvious he had no idea
what was really going on. Harry looked at Ginny who was furiously
glaring at George and could tell she was moments away from getting
her wand out.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
don't <em class="calibre9">have</em> a sex life, George," he said without showing a
hint of the embarrassment he was actually feeling. "But she's
right, it<em class="calibre9"> is</em> none of your business." He saw Ginny look at
him and then subside back into her seat as he stared at George,
daring him to comment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
wants more treacle tart?" asked Mrs Weasley a little louder than
was necessary.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
thanks, Mrs Weasley," said Harry quietly as he rose from his chair.
"Excuse me." He slipped quietly out the back door without saying
anything else to anyone. He wandered across the garden and stopped at
the shed, leaning his shoulder against it, looking up into the
darkening sky were stars twinkled faintly, hands in his pockets. He
turned as he heard someone coming across the garden behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"They'll
look different in Australia, won't they," said Mr Weasley as he
stood next to Harry looking at the sky.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
Hermione read about it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
help me in the shed, Harry," said Mr Weasley as he unlocked the
door and pushed it open. "I had to move the motorbike in here. I
think Molly still doesn't know, she can't tell the difference
between all these Muggle bits." Privately Harry thought Mr Weasley
might have been hoping a bit much to think that his wife did not know
he had practically a whole flying motorbike in his shed but he
followed Mr Weasley into the shed which was crammed with the oddest
assortment of items that Harry had ever seen.</p><p class="calibre8">Along
one wall was a series of boxes and Harry could see that they were
full of plugs. Three old toasters were sitting on the bench at the
far end of the shed and no less than six electric frying pans
littered the edges of the floor. Extension cords, table lamps and old
digital clocks were dangling from a beam that ran the length of the
shed and a bar fridge was stuffed in one corner, the door hanging
open to reveal that it housed approximately twelve screwdrivers, an
electric drill and a box of nuts and bolts. Harry thought he could
see a television and a computer keyboard on another bench but he was
only guessing because whatever it was had been taken apart
thoroughly. Pieces of Sirius's motorbike were lying haphazardly in
the middle of the floor and a rusty lawnmower was shoved behind the
door.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
wandered around the shed uncertainly, staring at the things that Mr
Weasley tinkered with in his spare time; while Mr Weasley himself lit
the lamps scattered around the shed and pulled a dusty box out from
under one of the benches. Digging through it, and tossing aside a
worn out cordless kettle, four packs of Muggle playing cards and what
was once a Discman, Mr Weasley extracted two cans of soft drink.
Setting them on the bench he refilled the box with the other items,
added one of the electric frying pans for good measure and pushed it
back under the bench.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now,
Harry," he said eagerly, "can you tell me what these do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
drinks, Mr Weasley," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
splendid! Splendid!" crowed Mr Weasley. "I told Perkins that is
what they were!" Harry smiled at his exuberance.</p><p class="calibre8">"Would
you like me to show you how they open?" he offered. Mr Weasley
nodded eagerly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you think we could drink them?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
guess so," Harry studied the cans, "although they're normally
served chilled. How long have you had them?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
got them in the last raid before things went completely rubbish after
Easter and we went into hiding at Muriel's," replied Mr Weasley
as he applied a cooling charm to the cans. "Middle of The New
Forest and the snacks in one of the pubs started flying around the
room; most disconcerting for the Muggles. We had to collect a whole
lot of things, sort out a right mess that time. These came back with
the enchanted snack food but we weren't able to find anything odd
about them at all." Mr Weasley seized the cans and sat down on the
floor in a clear spot between the lawnmower and what looked like the
exhaust pipe of the motorbike. Hesitating, Harry sat down, cross
legged opposite him. Mr Weasley handed him one of the cans.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
open that one and I'll copy you," he said. Harry grasped the can
and levered the ring up a little, Mr Weasley copying him exactly.
When Harry cracked his can open by pulling up hard on the ring and
pushing the end down the can's contents spurted out the top and
drenched Mr Weasley in a foamy mess. Harry was mortified. Clearly Mr
Weasley relished it as part of the experience; because he simply
laughed and cracked open his own can, showering Harry with orange
foam.</p><p class="calibre8">"Most
people try to avoid that actually," murmured Harry wryly as he
shook the fizzing liquid off his hands. "Must've been a bit
shaken up."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think we're all a bit shaken up lately," said Mr Weasley as he
used his wand to siphon up the spilled fizzy drink. He then took a
sip and laughed delightedly as the bubbles tickled on the way down.
Harry sat staring at the can in his hands, contemplating Mr Weasley's
words. "All right Harry?" He looked up at Mr Weasley who was
looking at him for all the world like a concerned father.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
he croaked out. "It's just I thought things would be easy now but
sometimes I wonder if they've just been replaced by different,
confusing things. At least it was straightforward before. Rid world
of Voldemort, live happily ever after." He laughed bitterly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
confusing, Harry?" asked Mr Weasley gently. Harry fixed his eyes on
the lawnmower, fiddling with the can in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
to do now," he whispered. "I sort of feel like I am supposed to
help fix things up but I really don't know how, or if I want to. I
don't know anything about the Ministry or politics. I want to
finish my education but is it silly to go back to Hogwarts? One
moment I feel a bit too old to be there and the next like I need it's
a safe haven." He looked up at Mr Weasley who nodded at him to
continue.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd
still like to be an Auror but it's like I'm not old enough yet,"
Harry shook his head. "Which is just ridiculous because normally
that's what I'd be doing this year, starting Auror training, and
I am of age, have been for a year. One minute I feel really old, like
I have been everywhere and done everything … I think dying and
spending time on the other side does that to you. The next minute I
feel like I haven't done anything, that I know nothing." He
stopped, staring hopelessly at Mr Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
tell you a secret, Harry," said Mr Weasley, his eyes looking
suspiciously wet. "It's like that for everyone. Not exactly the
same obviously, but sometimes I think being a grown up means that you
know you know nothing. Thinking you know everything is reserved for
youth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Molly
and I ran away and got married during the first war. We were
eighteen, the same age as you. At the time I was so sure it was the
right thing to do. We were adults, we could handle it. As soon as I
slipped that ring on her finger and we were alone it hit me. I was
absolutely petrified. What had we done? I felt responsible for her
now, her safety, her happiness. We'd gone off and gotten married
without her family knowing. Not that they didn't approve of course
but it was terribly exciting, going off secretly like that. Perhaps
it wasn't the smartest move I ever made. Marrying Molly certainly
was but running off to do it … I advise you not to do the same.
Molly's temper is a lot bigger than her own mother's." Mr
Weasley smiled as Harry felt a slight flush infuse his cheeks.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
did you know you were ready to get married, Mr Weasley?" asked
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I didn't, not really," Mr Weasley replied. "I think in the end
I took a leap of faith. It was Molly who knew."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
women know everything?" sighed Harry. Mr Weasley threw his head
back and laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
spent a lot of time with Hermione, son. She's uncommonly gifted and
very smart," he answered. "No women don't know everything. But
sometimes it would be a lot easier if they did, wouldn't it?"
Harry nodded in agreement. He stared at the can still in his hand
before taking a sip. Swallowing, he looked at Mr Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
it possible though, for one woman to know everything about you? Know
you inside out and back to front?" Harry asked him. "You know,
even if you still can't figure them out?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Eventually
you can. I think they often just get there first." Harry nodded his
head vehemently before taking another sip of his drink. Mr Weasley
studied him carefully for a moment and Harry looked up.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think you know Ginny better than you think you do," Mr Weasley
said. Harry sat motionless; they were no longer talking in vague,
general terms. They were no longer talking about growing up,
relationships and women as a whole, but specifically about Ginny.
"Why did you speak up to George before?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
was silent, thinking. Had he done the wrong thing, said the wrong
thing? Mr Weasley said he knew Ginny better than he thought he did so
did that mean he'd done the right thing? Eventually he shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
Ginny was about to hex him," he answered honestly. "She was going
to hex him for invading her privacy and trying to tell her what to
do. She hates when her brothers try and tell her what to do, even if
they're right." Mr Weasley tilted his head to one side, studying
Harry intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
think George is right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
Harry's voice was almost a whisper. "That sort of relationship is
… not something either of us are ready for. But it isn't for him
to decide. Ginny was embarrassed and she doesn't want those sort of
… details discussed as a family at the dinner table. Not that
there's anything to discuss." Harry sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"See,
you do know her," stated Mr Weasley. Harry looked up at him in
surprise. "She lets you defend her. That's rare for Ginny. She
does it partly because she knows you well enough, you like defending
people, and partly because she trusts you. She trusts you to know
where she's coming from. Instead of telling George to butt out on
your own account and taking over you backed <em class="calibre9">her</em> up.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
know her well enough to know which part had really upset Ginny and
the best way to defend her. You put aside your own embarrassment to
help her and defend her, not your own actions or worries. Being
questioned over your intentions and activities with the woman you
love by her brothers is never very fun. The automatic reaction is to
defend and justify yourself. To know what to do for <em class="calibre9">her</em> is
something special." Harry got the distinct impression that Mr
Weasley could remember a time when he'd defended himself to his
wife's brothers. He felt a sudden kinship to Mr Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought at one point they were going to hurt me," the older man
mused. "When I took Molly home to break the news that we'd eloped
to her parents her brothers were waiting for me. It's a good thing
Bill didn't arrive for several years, they were positive we'd got
ourselves into … well a spot of bother. Instead of standing up for
my wife I defended my own actions.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
was of age, I was of age, it was nothing to do with them. They had
nothing to do with what I chose to do thank you very much. I asserted
my right to do as I pleased with my wife. Not once did I think to
defend Molly's right to privacy or to remember that it was not just
my actions I was describing or justifying. They took her aside next
and had a word or two with her. If I'd spoken to them properly in
the first place …" Harry contemplated what Mr Weasley had said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
love Ginny," he said suddenly to his own surprise. He'd not meant
to blurt that out right then. Mr Weasley nodded. "I can't be away
from her again. If that's the only reason I'm going back to
Hogwarts, is that a selfish reason? Maybe I could be doing so much
more helping Kingsley or something."</p><p class="calibre8">"Even
if it is a selfish reason," said Mr Weasley, "and I don't think
it is; I still think it's the best thing for you to do. Even if
that is only because she couldn't bear to be away from you again
either and I think she'll need you if she's to go back there
again. If you look at it that way, it's not selfish at all."
Harry stood up suddenly, spilling some of the drink in his hands and
it made a small, fizzing puddle on the floor. He turned to examine
the pieces of the motorbike noting the scratches along a piece of
what was possibly once a mudguard. Something Mr Weasley just said
made him pause.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was hard for her at school last year wasn't it?" he asked as he
turned to look at Ginny's father and saw the pain briefly flash
across his face. Harry ran his hand haphazardly through his hair.
"Neville told us a bit about it and we heard some things but I
haven't really given much thought to what it was like at Hogwarts
last year. There's been so much to think about, so much to deal
with and there's still stuff I haven't even thought about.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
mean we've talked about it a bit but Ginny only ever told me how
she and Neville and Luna defied the Death Eaters. She's never let
on that it still hurts. How did I miss that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably
because she hasn't shown you that. Her biggest hurt was being away
from you and so the biggest part is healed because you've come
home," said Mr Weasley as he too rose from the floor and walked
over to look out of the shed's tiny window at the stars now
twinkling brightly in the night sky. "Some of the things that
happened at Hogwarts last year are going to mean it'll take effort
for the castle to seem like home again. She's happier now than
she's ever been but going back there after last year …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
Snape did his best to protect the students," said Harry and Mr
Weasley nodded. He picked up one of the toasters and rubbed the shiny
metal side of it. Harry gulped down more of the drink in his hand and
they stood in silence for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look
after my baby girl, Harry," Mr Weasley said suddenly, putting down
the toaster and turning to look Harry in the eye. "The only thing I
want for all of my children is for them to be happy, but Ginny …
Ginny is something special. When you have a daughter you'll know
what it's like. That little red-headed princess will capture your
heart and you'll be the only man in her life, the only man who can
make her smile, make her happy. Then one day you'll realise she's
given her heart to someone else, another man and he's the one who
makes her smile. If you're lucky, like I am, you'll be able to
hand her happiness over to him and know that he'll take as much
care of her smile as you always have. "</p><p class="calibre8">"Once
I never thought I'd even live long enough to get married or have
children," said Harry. "But I would like to, very much. I haven't
thought much about it. I know what I feel when I'm with Ginny, but
it's about more than how you feel in the moment isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Marriage
is definitely about more than the heat of the moment," agreed Mr
Weasley. He paused and then said, "it will be the most amazing
experience in the world to share yourself intimately, when you are
both ready." And Harry knew then that Mr Weasley was bestowing on
him perhaps the most precious thing he had. His daughter and her
happiness, it was in his hands now. But with that gift came
responsibilities, ones that Harry would gladly bear. He felt no
embarrassment as he had earlier but looked Mr Weasley in the eye and
asked,</p><p class="calibre8">"Does
she tell you when you're both ready then?" and Mr Weasley
laughed. Harry smiled and continued, "because I have absolutely no
idea!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Some
people rush into it," began Mr Weasley sobering slightly, leaning
against the bench behind him. "For me I knew that I could only …
claim that part of her once I made the bigger commitment to be her
husband. There's no going back afterwards so I wasn't prepared to
take that step until after I'd proven my commitment in a way that
was … more permanent. I knew a long time before we got engaged that
Molly was the only woman for me but I figured if I wasn't ready to
be her husband and shoulder that responsibility I wasn't ready to
bear the bigger responsibility and take her to bed either." Mr
Weasley blushed slightly then and Harry grinned at the candid way
he'd spoken.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you think it should wait for marriage then?" asked Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
certainly waited until then because I know it was the right decision
despite Molly's protests," answered Mr Weasley, "Not everybody
waits. It's what I advised my sons. I'm not your father though
..."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you're <em class="calibre9">her </em>father!" said Harry blushing profusely. He
sighed loudly and sat on a nearby upturned packing crate. "I wonder
what my father would have said …" A lone tear trailed unbidden
down his cheek as he realised he had no idea and no one left to tell
him what his father would have said. Mr Weasley crouched down in
front of Harry and tenderly wiped away the tear.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know what he would have said but I know that he loved you and
I know what it is like to love your son and I can tell you that he
would have only wanted for you to be happy," Mr Weasley paused,
reaching out a hand to lift Harry's head up to look at him. "And
he'd want to be sure that the woman who stole his son's heart
from his wife was worthy of that affection. Maybe I am biased but I
think James Potter would have been pleased with the woman who holds
your heart in her hands." Harry held Mr Weasley's gaze steadily.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
could shatter it into a million pieces," he breathed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Terrifying,
isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Worth
it though," said Harry and Mr Weasley nodded in agreement.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know I'm not your father, Harry but -" and Mr Weasley found
himself unable to finish his sentence because Harry and put his arms
around him and given him the same sort of heartfelt hug he had given
Mrs Weasley on his birthday last year. Mr Weasley returned the hug
and then they both stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Mr Weasley."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
probably time we turned in, son," he said as he led Harry out of
the shed door. Looking thoughtfully at Harry he said, "Mr Weasley's
getting to be a bit formal. You can call me Arthur if you want to."
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets and began tracing a circle in
the dirt with his toe, staring at the swirling dirt and the puffs of
dust he could see floating up in the lingering lamplight as Mr
Weasley snuffed them out.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
keep calling me 'son', d'you think … well … would it be
okay if sometimes I could call you Dad?" Harry said, barely
audible. He hurried on. "I don't think my dad would mind and
you're the only one I'll ever know –" Mr Weasley put his hand
on Harry's shoulder and Harry looked up at his face to see the
older man with tears gathering in the corners of his twinkling eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd
be honoured, son."</p>
