<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_42">*Chapter 41*: Chapter 41</h2>
			<p class="calibre8">Hello, loyal
readers! I have noted all the people who have put this story on alert
or favourites or written reviews – so many of you! Thank you all, I
am glad you are enjoying the story and hope you will continue to do
so – ten chapters left – savour them!</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
41. Yuletide</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The week stretched
on with no word from Ron. Hermione grew pale and only ate when
Neville forced her to, sitting over her and loading up her plate and
then her fork. Ginny reminded her to go to class, to brush her teeth,
to go to bed. Harry had tried to convince Hermione that Ron, never a
very diligent letter writer, had simply been too busy to write. Ginny
wrote to Fleur, asking if Bill was all right and Thursday morning had
brought her response.</p><p class="calibre8">"She says she
hasn't heard from Bill," Ginny whispered to Harry behind the
Daily Prophet. "It's been nearly two weeks since she had a letter
and she started writing in French. I don't know what it says but I
think she's concerned." Harry eyed Hermione carefully. Neville
was cutting her bacon for her and she sat with a goblet of pumpkin
juice that she'd not drunk.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's it, I'm
going," Harry whispered back. He pushed his chair backwards
suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You – now?"
Ginny raised her eyebrows. "Just tell Kingsley. He can send
someone."</p><p class="calibre8">"I just … it's
Ron," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ginny
whispered. Her bottom lip trembled and she caught it between her
teeth. "Fleur said Mum and Dad don't know Bill hasn't written.
We can't tell them." Ginny lost her battle with the tears and
Harry pulled her into his arms, rubbing her back softly and
whispering into her hair. The Daily Prophet lay like a blanket over
their breakfasts and although Harry could feel every eye in the Great
Hall on them, he tried to focus on Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Hermione
asked, her voice slightly raspy. "Is it from Ron?" Harry shook
his head slowly and Hermione turned away to stare at the Hufflepuff
table.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's really
missing, isn't he?" Neville asked quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fleur hasn't
heard from Bill," Harry explained as Ginny sniffed and straightened
up. Hermione's knuckles were white as she held tightly to the
goblet and Neville eased it from her grasp as her hands began to
shake and it threatened to spill down her robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" Hermione
asked suddenly. "Why is this happening? Must there always be an
emergency?" Her voice was rising, ringing out shrilly in the Great
Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's probably
just a hold up with the post birds-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you lie
to me, Harry Potter!"Hermione leapt from her seat. She was pale and
shaking but her eyes were boring into his face. "We've been
through too much together for me to believe that and in case you've
forgotten, Ron was there too! Why haven't you gone to look for him
yet? WHY?" She broke down crying and Neville pulled her to her feet
and began to lead her outside, Harry and Ginny followed hastily.</p><p class="calibre8">The Great Hall was
deathly quiet; the only sounds the clattering of their feet and
Hermione's sobs. As they reached the door Harry halted, turning
around at the sound of Luna's voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Aren't you
pretty? A bird as handsome as you should be a bit better at this,"
she chided the magnificent owl perched on her arm. Luna was walking
towards them, carrying a sand-coloured owl with brown flecks on its
wings and the largest orange eyes Harry had ever seen. It had a blunt
looking black beak and large, vicious looking talons.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's a
Pharaoh Eagle Owl," Ginny said slowly. "Sometimes, when he was
working in Egypt, Bill would send letters with them. They aren't
very reliable though. Perhaps they think post delivery is below
them."</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione stared at
the owl which blinked at her impassively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Has it got a
letter?" Hermione whispered to Luna. The owl hooted, ignoring
Hermione and fluttering over to Harry's shoulder. He yelped as the
owl dug it's talons into his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wish you birds
wouldn't do that," Harry said, wincing. The owl stuck a leg under
Harry's nose haughtily and as soon as he pulled the letter off the
owl soared up and out of the Great Hall. Harry turned the letter over
carefully. His name was scrawled on the outside of a thick parchment
envelope in Ron's handwriting.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's from Ron,"
he said neutrally. The other four stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Open it,"
Hermione eventually said. Her hands were still shaking and without
thinking too hard about it Harry reached for her hand and pulled her
out of the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Should we follow
them?" he heard Luna ask as the doors swung shut behind them,
muffling Ginny's answer. He gathered it was no, however, when no
one followed them.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione sat down
suddenly on a bench in the Entrance Hall and dropped her head into
her hands, resting her elbows on her knees. Harry sank down next to
her, the envelope clutched in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's Ginny?"
Hermione asked. Harry shrugged, his trembling fingers sliding under
the back flap of the envelope and breaking the seal.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why did he write
to me?" Harry asked quietly as he pulled out the piece of parchment
inside. "Why didn't he write to you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't care,"
Hermione whispered. "We don't even know … maybe he didn't
write it."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's his
handwriting," Harry pointed out. He unfolded the letter, smoothing
it on his knees. Hermione's eyes were glued to the flagstones in
front of her and her hands were clenched in tight fists in her lap.
Harry cleared his throat and began to read aloud.</p><p class="calibre8">iDear Harry,</p><p class="calibre8">Thanks very much for
your recent letter. I wish that you'd given me a warning about the
singing card attached to the same owl and that your letter hadn't
been a Howler which arrived right as we happened upon a
magically-sealed cave that we had located with some difficulty. I
guess whoever was inside had sealed it up for a reason because Bill
and I got knocked out and chained up in a musty Egyptian tomb.</p><p class="calibre8">We're lucky I
carry a picture of you in my Muggle wallet, you great git! Yeah,
that's right, we've been masquerading as Muggles and I carry your
picture in my wallet. Well, you should probably know it's one of
you, me and Hermione that Ginny took on your birthday.</p><p class="calibre8">So anyway, the guys
who locked us up were really apologetic … after a while – when
they realised we were telling the truth: that's the war's over,
that we won and that I really do know Harry Bloody Potter personally.
Bill started off by cussing me out for having a moving picture in my
Muggle wallet but then we figured the guys who got us were wizards
and he was thanking me for it!</p><p class="calibre8">Here's a tip for
the future though – if you've got your hands chained up to the
wall of some musty old pyramid it's a bit hard to reach the wand
hidden in your sock! They came in and fed us but … we're okay
now. We found what we're looking for, we'll be home for Christmas
and we're bringing presents.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron</p><p class="calibre8">P.S. The ruddy owl
won't take my letter for Hermione. Bill reckons it's too fat and
heavy. Stupid, stuck-up Egyptian snob of a bird. Tell her I love
her, mate./i</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione started to
cry, great heaving sobs of relief as she snatched at the letter.
Harry let her have it and patted her back gingerly as she traced the
postscript with one forefinger.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's okay, he's
fine," he said quietly. Hermione took a deep breath and turned to
look at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I want ... can I
keep it?" Hermione asked. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Course."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
Hermione said before bursting into tears again. Harry shook his head
ruefully as Ginny stuck her head out of the doors to the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"What did he say?"
she asked. She looked small and frail, worrying her bottom lip with
her teeth. "Is he all right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"He – he's
fine," Hermione stammered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then why are you
crying like some great girl?" Ginny asked as she slipped around the
door and came towards them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Beats me,"
Harry said, grinning. "Reckon it's cause she's a girl though."</p><p class="calibre8">"He said it,
Ginny," Hermione said suddenly pressing the letter into the other
girl's hands. Ginny smoothed it out and began reading.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh dear," Ginny
said as she scanned the letter. "It looks like we got Ron into a
spot of bother. Mum's going to kill me."</p><p class="calibre8">"He could have
been in real danger!" Hermione said suddenly, her eyes flashing.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's all
right," said Ginny, shrugging.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Hermione
sighed before she sat up straight. "Look at the bottom." Harry
watched as Ginny's eyes flickered to the bottom and went wide.</p><p class="calibre8">"He actually said
it," Ginny breathed. "Well I'll be …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Said what? What
did he say?" Harry asked irritably.</p><p class="calibre8">"He used the 'L'
word," Ginny informed him solemnly as she handed Hermione the
letter.</p><p class="calibre8">"The what?"
Harry asked in confusion looking between the girls as Ginny giggled
and Hermione smiled blissfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"The 'L' word,
Harry," Ginny said, laying a hand on his chest and fluttering her
eyelashes at him. "He said ilove/i." Harry
scratched at the back of his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's never said
it before," Hermione said softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But you said he
writes every second day," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's never said
he loves me," Hermione said simply.</p><p class="calibre8">"But … he does,"
Harry said forcefully. "I know he does!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know he does,"
Hermione said, "but it's nice to hear it." She folded Harry's
letter meticulously and tucked it inside her robes.</p><p class="calibre8">**************</p><p class="calibre8">The remaining days
of term were a whirlwind of classes and hastily finished homework so
that the break would be free. Hermione had recovered her good humour
and Pigwidgeon brought a letter from Ron, bigger than he was, two
days before they were due to go home for Christmas.</p><p class="calibre8">"Poor ittle,
wittle Pig," Ginny crooned as Hermione tore open the fat envelope
at the breakfast table. "Did big bad Won-Won make you carry that
huge letter all the way to Hogwarts? Poor birdie." Pigwidgeon
pecked at her fingers and Ginny yelped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't call him
Won-Won," said Hermione idly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Vicious little …"
said Ginny, glaring at the little owl. Harry watched with amusement
as Arnold, who had taken to stowing away in Ginny's pocket and
darting out to steal bacon from Harry's plate at breakfast, fluffed
out his fur. He could have sworn the little pigmy puff was baring his
teeth – if he had any – at Pig.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's not
vicious," Hermione crooned holding a hand out to Pig. "He's a
wonderful, gorgeous, smart little bitty owl, yes he is." Pig hopped
onto Hermione's hand and up her arm as Ginny scowled at them.</p><p class="calibre8">"How come he lets
you talk to him like that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because Pig knows
Won-Won wuvs her," Harry interjected, smirking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can you just read
your own letters and leave me in peace?" Hermione snapped, tired of
the silly games and eyeing her letter hungrily.</p><p class="calibre8">"What letters?"
Ginny asked, laughing. Her face fell as Errol landed with a splash in
her cornflakes and she grimaced. "Stupid bird." Pigwidgeon
bounced up and down on Hermione's arm and looked for all the world
as if he were laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny gingerly
pulled the owl out of her breakfast and pulled the letter from his
leg before setting him next to her bowl. She pushed the bowl away
with a frown and prodded at Errol experimentally before sighing and
unfurling the scroll, noting that Liberty had swooped down and was
offering Harry her leg proudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It came through,"
Harry whispered, staring at a bundle of parchment in his in hand. "I
did it."</p><p class="calibre8">"The babies?"
Ginny asked as she stilled her hands on the scroll of her mother's
letter. Harry nodded, his eyes searching the parchment in front of
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're not
really babies, one of them is two and the other is nearly four," he
murmured. "But the paperwork is all here and Dad says he took them
to Sirius House yesterday."</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope Mum
doesn't smother them." Ginny grinned at Harry and they both
laughed, knowing it was a distinct possibility.</p><p class="calibre8">"What does she
say?" Harry asked, gesturing at Ginny's letter as he folded his
own and tucked it in his bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dunno," Ginny
shrugged, unrolled the scroll at last and scanned the short missive.
"Bring your dress robes?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it says
'Dear Ginny, looking forward to seeing you all for Christmas, Dad
will meet you at Kings Cross, bring dress robes, love Mum',"
Ginny replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's a bit
odd," Hermione murmured. "It's not like you need dress robes
for Christmas. You don't suppose she's starting a new tradition
or something, do you? I wonder if she means me as well. I'm going
to visit my parents but I'll be at the Burrow most of the holidays,
I suspect."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't imagine
why," Ginny said dryly as they picked up their bags to follow the
rest of the school shuffling off to class. "Did young Ronald say
when he'd be coming home in that enormous roll of parchment he sent
you?" Hermione shook her head but clutched it dreamily to her
chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"He said it again,
you know … right there on the first page …"</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny rolled her
eyes and stalked off muttering something under her breath. It sounded
like 'lovesick fools' but whatever it was, it was definitely not
a compliment judging by the expression on her face.</p><p class="calibre8">*************</p><p class="calibre8">When they arrived at
Kings Cross for the Christmas holidays Arthur greeted Harry, Ginny
and Hermione warmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You didn't have
to meet us," Ginny said as she hugged her father. "We're old
enough to Apparate home by ourselves now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny, you don't
even have your licence yet," Hermione chided.</p><p class="calibre8">"Actually I needed
to come for the children," Arthur said gesturing at the group of
students huddled together at the end of the platform with Professor
Crockwell. Matthew, a second year Hufflepuff boy and his younger
sister Eve, a Ravenclaw, had been in hiding with their parents and
the family of a first year Gryffindor named Louise when a Death Eater
raid had taken their parents. The three children had been well hidden
in the basement and discovered by Muggle authorities some hours
later. They were to come to Sirius House along with Marie, the
Muggleborn Gryffindor who'd lost her family when Death Eaters had
blown up her house shortly after she got her Hogwarts letter.</p><p class="calibre8">The four of them
looked small and lost and Hermione hurried over to bring them over to
meet Arthur.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," Ginny
smiled as the students began trailing after Hermione. "Where's
Mum then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's at Sirius
House," Arthur answered with a smile. "I told Mrs Chumley we'd
bring her boys along. I'll ah, need your help to round them up."</p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't long
before Gilbert and Gerald were standing with them and the little
group of students who'd be going to Sirius House for the holidays.
Gerald was scowling and Gilbert was bouncing on his toes excitedly,
waving to Dexter and Othello as they left with their parents.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
Hamish?" Harry asked, surveying the assorted trunks in front of
him. They were topped with Liberty's cage, Crookshanks's carrier
and the little travel tote for Arnold that Ginny had recently
acquired as a gift from George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, he's
staying at school for a couple of days and then his mum's picking
him up and they're going to Switzerland for Christmas!" Gilbert
babbled excitedly. "He said he'd probably visit the place where
they make those Every Flavour Beans and Chocolate Frogs and stuff and
bring us back a iheap/i of stuff! He's so lucky.
I'm going to travel when I'm bigger. Did you ever want to travel
Mr – Harry? I mean I think going camping sounds fabulous and Dexter
reckons they always go camping for the World Cup and we might be able
to go with him next time. Have you been to the World Cup? Did you
like it? Was there camping?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I don't
much like camping," Harry muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum reckons you
helped her get a job at this place," Gilbert prattled on, dancing
about. "Have you seen where we're going?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes I have,"
Harry murmured, staring helplessly at Mr Weasley who was eyeing the
large pile of trunks and other baggage with a frown.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is it a big
place?" Gilbert prattled on. "I've never lived in a big place,
Mum said it was a big place but then she's never seen Hogwarts. She
said me and Gerald might have to share a room because of all the
other kids but I don't mind that because we usually share a room.
It'll be fun having other kids around though. I don't know the
girls very well ... D'you think boys can be friends with girls?
I've not got any friends that are girls yet at Hogwarts. Dexter
reckons girls are yucky but you seem to really like 'em, Harry."
Gilbert looked up at him expectantly and Harry could see Arthur
smirking at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I think you
can be friends with girls," Harry said eventually, shaking his head
at Ginny who was dissolving in helpless laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right then!"
Arthur said rubbing his hands together. "Glad you could all join us
for the holidays. Well not exactly us, because the house isn't big
enough for all of us, but we'll see a bit of you I expect. Let's
get going and see if Molly isn't waiting for us with some hot
chocolate. She'll have my hide if I let you stand here freezing
your ears off much longer! Right then … I'm not good at shrinking
things and we can't take one of those trolley things down the
street. You lot are all dressed right for Muggle streets?" He cast
a glance around the group; Gerald still scowling heavily, Gilbert
still bouncing and the four orphaned students staring at Harry in
awe.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione smiled and
went to her trunk, extracting a familiar beaded bag. It didn't take
long for all the trunks to be swallowed up into the one bag which
Arthur insisted on carrying. Hermione tried to explain that Muggle
men didn't carry beaded handbags but Arthur was having none of it,
consenting only to Hermione casting a mild Confounding charm on the
bag so that it appeared to be a brown leather satchel to any Muggle
who looked closely at it. Harry picked up Liberty's cage and
Hermione and Ginny each carried their pets and the group left Kings
Cross and braved the chill to take the short walk to Grimmauld Place.</p><p class="calibre8">As they approached,
the wind began to howl around their legs and Harry thought his
fingers were going to freeze right through his gloves. He was holding
Ginny's hand but he could barely feel it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Next time we get
taxis," he grumbled. Ginny smiled at him and pressed closer to his
side. Harry couldn't help it; he smiled back at her and leaned down
to kiss her soundly. Ginny blushed at the sound of muffled giggling
coming from the two first year Gryffindor girls but it just made
Harry smack at her lips exaggeratedly until Ginny pushed him away,
laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly Harry,"
Hermione rolled her eyes. "You should set an example."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, that's a
very good example," Ginny said with a sly grin and Hermione frowned
at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are we here? Is
this it?" Gilbert chattered excitedly as the street lights winked
into existence around the little square in the middle of Grimmauld
Place. Gilbert peered through the gate. "Oh this looks like a super
place for a snowball fight! I hope it snows for Christmas – do you
hope it snows, Harry? Oh I suppose you won't be here anyway …
unless – will you?" The boy looked up at him hopefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only Father
Christmas could beat me here on Christmas morning," Harry said.
Gilbert beamed and scampered up the street calling out that he'd
find number twelve for them. It didn't take him long and Harry
laughed as he watched the boy caper about on the footpath outside
Sirius House which was sporting the biggest door wreath Harry had
ever seen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can we go in, can
we go in?" Gilbert called as the rest of the group approached. "How
tall is the house? It goes up forever!" Gilbert tipped his head
back so far Harry thought he might tip over.</p><p class="calibre8">"It really is very
good of you," said Matthew. His sister had been clinging to his
hand since they left the train station. Harry just shrugged
uncomfortably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well then, let's
see," Arthur broke in. "How about you press the doorbell there,
lad." He nodded at Gilbert who dashed up the steps eagerly and
leaned heavily on the bell. A Christmas Carol blasted out from behind
the door and Gilbert jumped back, laughing with delight. Arthur
smiled. "George charmed it."</p><p class="calibre8">The door swung open
and Fleur stood in the doorway, her silvery hair shining in the light
from several lamps shining along the hallway. Gilbert stared at her,
mouth agape.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wow," he
breathed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are …
Gilbert?" Fleur asked softly and Gilbert nodded enthusiastically.
"Your mother, she is in the kitchen. Your brother, he is 'ere?"</p><p class="calibre8">"All here, safe
and sound, Fleur dear," Arthur said marching up the steps and
beckoning to the children clustered behind him. "Right then, in we
go, straight down to the kitchen with you lot, hang your coats up
here, that's the way." The children had followed him up the steps
and Harry could see them clustered in the doorway, divesting
themselves of hats, scarves and coats. Harry, Hermione and Ginny
followed the younger students inside. The hallway was festooned in
wreaths and garlands and ribbons that wound their way up the
banisters.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wow, it's
huge," Gilbert said in awe, staring up at the vaulted ceiling. He
peered up the staircase. "Is the kitchen up here?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, it's down
…" Harry trailed off having caught sight of the space where Mrs
Black used to hang. The same frame was still there but in place of
the hateful woman who had screamed obscenities at those who passed
was a handsome young man, his glossy black hair shining in waves
nearly to his shoulders, his full lips curved in a welcoming smile
and his eyes clear and bright as if they sparkled.</p><p class="calibre8">The portrait didn't
move or speak but it was clearly of Sirius.</p><p class="calibre8">"How …" Harry
gazed at the portrait, barely noticing as Hermione, Ginny and Fleur
began herding the children down the stairs into the kitchen, Gerald
was dragging his feet, still scowling heavily at his surroundings.</p><p class="calibre8">"We couldn't get
it to move magically," Arthur said, his voice held a note of
apology. "Mrs Chumley was a bit afraid of a moving one in any case
but we hired the best artist we could and he worked on that night and
day these past two weeks. Do you like it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know you didn't
tell us to do that," Arthur said, "but we thought it only
fitting. The House is named after him and the wall needed something.
See here, it's got his name on the frame and we've got frames
ready to go for the children if they have any special photographs of
family they want to hang in their rooms. Mrs Chumley's started
things off, here." He pointed to a series of photographs of two
chubby boys that were hanging on the wall of the staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"Molly's got tea
ready in the kitchen before going home and Fleur's staying the
night to help them all settle in," Arthur continued. "Of course
if you don't want to stay …"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, no, that's
fine," Harry said, tearing his eyes away from the portrait. "It's
… you've done more than … this really can be a home, can't
it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course it
can," Arthur said softly. "There's a lovely meal in the kitchen
waiting for young tummies and then a huge tree begging to be trimmed
up in the drawing room. But most importantly, those women in there
have got love just oozing out in spades for these kids. They'll be
well taken care of, Harry."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,"
Harry said. Arthur smiled and clapped him on the shoulder as they
made their way down to the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">Molly greeted him
effusively, two small faces peeping out from behind her robes. The
two children from St Mungo's were shy but Gilbert soon had them
laughing and giggling as he pulled funny faces at them from behind
Gerald's back. For his part, Gerald was making a show of disliking
everything but even he couldn't fail to be impressed by Molly
Weasley's cooking.</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs Chumley talked
animatedly with all of them, finding out all the things they had been
doing and being suitably impressed by their exploits in class. The
little Ravenclaw didn't say anything throughout the meal but the
others eagerly told her all about Potions and Charms class and the
time Hagrid had accidentally brought a Bowtruckle to lunch with him
and it started making a nest in Professor Sprout's hair. After tea
they all traipsed up the stairs and the children selected rooms.
Gilbert raced all the way to the top of the stairs and opened a door.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is so cool,"
he shouted down the stairs. "It's just like in the Tower! Can I
sleep in this one, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You can sleep
wherever you like," Harry said, swallowing the lump in his throat,
knowing Sirius would approve of this exuberant boy taking over his
bedroom. Ginny sensed how difficult this was for Harry and squeezed
his hand tightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He'd like
this," she said and Harry nodded. Gerald had taken Regulus's old
room and the trunks had been delivered to their owners' new
bedrooms before everyone gathered in the drawing room.</p><p class="calibre8">It was after
midnight when Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys arrived back at the
Burrow. They spent all evening trimming the huge tree Hagrid had sent
over and Harry was asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.</p><p class="calibre8">It was late when
Harry woke the next morning. Weak sunlight filtered through the tiny
window in Ron's room and Harry's watch told him it was half past
ten.</p><p class="calibre8">"Blimey," he
muttered, scrambling out of bed and searching hastily for a pair of
trousers. He pulled a jumper over his head and donned a pair of thick
socks and a pair of battered trainers before heading downstairs to
breakfast.</p><p class="calibre8">The kitchen was
deserted except for Angelina, sitting at the table reading iThe
Daily Prophet/i and drinking a cup of tea.</p><p class="calibre8">"Morning, Harry,"
she said. "Molly left you some breakfast." She gestured to a
plate that lay on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where is
everyone?" Harry asked, sitting opposite her and sliding the plate
towards himself.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione's gone
to visit her parents," Angelina said, "and Ginny and George are
having a conversation with their parents, in there." She gestured
towards the living room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," Harry
raised an eyebrow and began to eat. "And you're sitting out here
all alone because …?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Waiting for
Georgie," she said. "I was talking to Fred but it got too cold
out there." She shivered a little and stared out the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"How is … um how
are you?" Harry asked. Angelina shrugged and began folding creases
in one of the serviettes sitting on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're telling
Ginny about the baby," said Angelina a bit distractedly as she
pulled the serviette into the shape of a bird.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, okay,"
Harry said as he chewed his breakfast. She didn't seem very
talkative and Harry had no idea what to say. He was glad when George
bounded into the room only a moment later.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry! You're
awake! Finally!" he said as he swooped over to Angelina and wrapped
his arms around her from behind. Harry watched as she turned her head
to George slightly and he pressed a kiss to her cheek, one of his
hands coming to rest on her stomach.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am," was all
Harry said as he watched Angelina smile for the first time since he'd
come down and present the bird to George on one open palm. George
loosened his hold on her and pulled his wand out. He waved it at the
bird and charmed it to fly around the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">It would have been
fluid and graceful except that Ginny walked in at the precise moment
it flew past the door and it smacked her in the face, unfolding and
falling flat to the floor, twitching feebly. Ginny scowled at the
serviette before she looked up at Angelina and George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
congratulations," she said with a smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
Angelina said, smiling back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, now that
you both know our news …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't tell
Harry," Angelina interrupted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry already
knows," George said.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I didn't
tell him about the wedding."</p><p class="calibre8">"The what?" Both
Harry and Ginny stared at the other couple in shock.</p><p class="calibre8">"Christmas Eve,"
George said.</p><p class="calibre8">"That was …
fast," Ginny said, sitting abruptly in the chair next to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll come,
won't you?" Angelina said anxiously. Ginny eyed her carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course," she
said, leaning forward slightly. "I wouldn't miss it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Angie's been
worried that you wouldn't want anything to do with it," George
said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" Ginny
asked, frowning.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know how you
feel about Fleur," Angelina said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah but she's
all … girly," Ginny said with a grimace. Angelina burst into
tears and Ginny looked increasingly alarmed.</p><p class="calibre8">"See?" George
said, patting his fiancée on the arm. "I told you, she's fine
with it."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can be girly,"
Angelina wailed. George grinned at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know …" he
trailed off suggestively and Angelina hit him on the arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I'm very
pleased," Ginny said getting up and sliding into a chair next to
Angelina. "George couldn't choose anyone better."</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"
Angelina sniffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, he couldn't,"
Ginny reassured her. "I know you didn't really expect this but …
he's happier than he's been for months." Ginny took her hands
and squeezed them in her own.</p><p class="calibre8">"My family's a
bit disappointed in me," Angelina confessed. "They keep looking
at me sadly, as if I won't ever be happy, you know. They think …
they think I might be settling for something."</p><p class="calibre8">"Honey, no one
ever isettles/i for George," Ginny said with a
smirk. Angelina laughed and wiped away the remnants of the tears on
her cheeks. Ginny handed Angelina a conjured handkerchief. "Are you
happy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Angelina
whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then you need to
start acting like it," Ginny said with finality. "Now, you aren't
going to make me wear some sort of soppy dress to this thing are
you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nope, you can
wear what you like," George said, running a hand across Angelina's
shoulders. She shivered visibly at his touch.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is this why Mum
said to bring dress robes?" Ginny asked suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dress robes?"
George asked blankly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it is a
wedding …" Ginny trailed off and shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Whatever you
like, Ginny," George repeated. Ginny nodded and watched as George
ran his hands down Angelina's arms and across to rest on her
slightly swollen stomach. He smiled slightly as he looked down at his
hands and then kissed Angelina's cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, okay then,"
Ginny said. George nodded briefly before pulling Angelina out of her
seat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let us go and see
a man about a dog!"</p><p class="calibre8">"A what?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dunno," George
shrugged, laughing. "I heard a Muggle say it once and it sounds
funny." Angelina grinned at him and the two of them linked arms and
headed for the cloaks near the back door.</p><p class="calibre8">They slipped out,
laughing and joking. Harry saw George tuck his hand into Angelina's
and then they were gone, the door swinging shut silently behind them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Big news,"
Harry said quietly into the stillness.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Ginny
was staring at nothing. Suddenly she straightened and turned to
Harry. "How'd you already know she was having a baby?"</p><p class="calibre8">"George told me
last time we visited," Harry confessed.</p><p class="calibre8">"And you didn't
say anything?"</p><p class="calibre8">"He asked me not
to," Harry said. Ginny nodded slightly before sitting pensively and
watched him finish eating.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's pretty
big," Ginny said. Harry looked up at her tone. She was staring at
her hands, but she wasn't really seeing them, he could tell. "Big
news I mean."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah …" Harry
trailed off, uncertain what she was thinking.</p><p class="calibre8">"I mean, it's
good news," Ginny said. "Well sort of, it's not news I'd want
to get – oh, I mean right now. I don't mean forever, um … one
day I could use news like that … probably … Merlin, I'm messing
this up."</p><p class="calibre8">"Me either,"
Harry said firmly, abandoning his breakfast. "I don't mean
forever either. Merlin knows I want to have children, but …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not even
eighteen," Ginny said, "but if you had asked me this time last
year I would have told you I wanted to have a baby and it would have
been true."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" Harry
asked, not understanding. She had been only sixteen and a half then,
still in school. It had been the middle of a war.</p><p class="calibre8">"The one thing
that would have been … did you know one of the first years died,
right before Christmas?" Ginny said. Harry shook his head, stunned.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," he said
softly, gently, the horror in his mind threatening to overcome him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't know
him, not well," Ginny said, a silent tear rolling down her cheek.
"His name was Duncan. He was just a little Hufflepuff kid who
forgot he wasn't supposed to speak in the hallways and … and …
he didn't survive the torture." Ginny dissolved in tears and
Harry pulled her into his lap, rocking her gently, the horrible tale
too awful to believe.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, Ginny," he
whispered into her hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"There is only one
thing that could take away that horrible, awful feeling," Ginny
said quietly as her sobs subsided. "I think that's why Angelina
and George are so at peace with this. They're both so … it's
like a balm. I was eating breakfast when Angelina arrived and George
he just … I couldn't believe it. His face just lit up when he saw
her. You know how he's looked jumpy or jittery for months? Like
he's always looking behind him or next to him for something and
sometimes he stops, like he's waiting for someone else to say
something or do something?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry nodded. He'd
seen George stop and turn to look for his twin. He'd seen him leave
doors open a little longer than necessary or hesitate before sitting
in a chair that had no empty seat next to it. He'd seen George sit,
staring into space wearing one of Fred's old jumpers and twirling
the wrong wand in his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"This morning he
was … different," Ginny said slowly. "I don't know how
exactly, he's still sad. It's so awful to see him sad. But he
smiled and his eyes sort of wrinkled up at the edges and it was like
his eyes were smiling too. Of course, when he inexplicably kissed her
belly I may have asked a few too many pointed questions."</p><p class="calibre8">"He looked
different." Harry smiled. "It's a bit unexpected but I think
it's a good thing for George."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know if
this is a truly healthy thing, but it's a good thing," said
Ginny, nodding. "I know all I wanted to do that day we found out
about Duncan was smash things but … Tonks sent me a letter. I don't
know how it got through. Fred and George had charmed some sort of
quill to write in code I think. She wrote all about being pregnant
and feeling the baby kick and it was just … so beautiful and I
wished that I was pregnant because it sounded so wonderful and
hopeful and we were running out of hope fast. That's what this is
for them. It's hope."</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">The next two days
passed in a flurry of activity. Penelope ihad/i
forgotten to cancel the church and George and Angelina had taken
Percy up on the offer to use it for their ceremony.</p><p class="calibre8">"Too cold to get
married outside," George said, on Monday morning, waving at the
blanket of snow that had fallen overnight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's a
good thing you've not invited many people then, if you want to have
the reception here," said Molly as she scrubbed vigorously at the
kitchen windows. "Merlin knows we don't have a lot of room
inside."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
we need a big to-do," George said quietly from his seat at the
table where he'd been told to sit and shine a few ancient pieces of
battered silverware.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh nonsense,"
Molly scoffed, handing Harry and Ginny some cleaning rags and
pointing them to an already pristine shelf in the corner of the
kitchen. "A few decorations aren't a big to-do."</p><p class="calibre8">"Christmas
decorations are fine, Mum," George said wearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't mind,"
Molly insisted, standing back to inspect the windows. "You could
have a lovely purple theme or perhaps blue. You've always looked
nice in blue. Wouldn't take long at all to hang a few streamers,
maybe coax a few more fairies out to light the place up. Oh, we could
get your father to see if he could borrow that marquee, the one with
the heater, from that fellow at the Ministry. Oh … what's his
name … Figgers, Fidgeon … Fedders …"</p><p class="calibre8">"We've only
invited close family, Mum," George said, setting a silver tureen
down with a thump, "for a bite to eat, not a three course meal."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I know, and
you're lucky that Auntie Muriel isn't very put out," Molly said
with a sniff. "If she hadn't already planned a trip down to see
Great Uncle Jasper I wouldn't hear the end of it for months. So,
purple or blue?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" George
asked, scowling at the three silver goblets he was to polish.</p><p class="calibre8">"For a colour
scheme, dear," Molly said patiently, inspecting a tray that she had
pulled from the pantry.</p><p class="calibre8">"We don't need a
colour scheme, Mum," George replied. "I told you, Christmas
decorations are fine."</p><p class="calibre8">"Just string up
some extra mistletoe," Ginny said cheekily and grinned at George.
He smiled back weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I do hope Ron and
Bill are back in time," Molly said as she unearthed more serving
trays and platters from a cupboard under the sink and piled them on
the table. "The wedding is in three days!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She says that
like I don't know," George muttered mutinously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now, have you got
your robes, dear?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Mum."</p><p class="calibre8">"I should make
sure Ron's dress robes are nice and pressed-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It doesn't
matter," George said, pushing his chair back. "I told you, I
don't care if you all wear dress robes or not. Let the poor bloke
wear what he likes."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well …" Molly
trailed off uncertainly before taking a deep breath. "If he's
going to stand up with you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"He's not,"
George said shortly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, did you ask
Percy then?" Molly asked. "Is he all right with being in a
wedding? It's just he's not been very interested, not that I can
blame him, poor boy."</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I didn't
ask Percy," George said. "Can we just drop it please?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We really should
fill out the programmes," Molly said, frowning. "You need to
decide who your best man is going to be-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," George
said, clutching the back of the chair. "No best man."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you need to
have someone-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" George
said through gritted teeth. "No colour schemes, no heated
monstrosities in the garden and no best man! There isn't one!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sure one of
your brothers would be happy-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," George
whispered, his voice anguished. "Not one of them." Without
warning George threw aside the chair he'd been clutching. It
crashed to the floor and cracked apart down the middle. The noise
brought Arthur racing in from the sitting room where he'd been sent
to polish picture frames. Harry and Ginny stood motionless as George
began hurling the silver he'd been polishing to the floor, the
ancient pieces bouncing wildly across the floor, fresh dents marring
their surface.</p><p class="calibre8">Arthur dropped the
polishing cloth in his hand and raced to his son, folding his arms
around him and stopping the senseless destruction. George sank to the
floor, bringing his father with him and turned and began sobbing
helplessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No best man,"
George whispered over and over again. "No best man, he's gone."</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay," Arthur
said quietly, holding George, tears dripping down his own nose and
into his son's hair. "No best man. You don't have to have a
best man." He stayed on the floor rocking George as if he were a
little baby and Molly sank into a chair, her face white and her hands
shaking. Ginny began levitating the silverware back onto the table
and Harry quietly began repairing the dents as best he could.</p><p class="calibre8">Things remained a
little tense at the Burrow until the next morning when, in the middle
of shining all the candlesticks in the house, the back door flew open
and a flurry of snow blew in along with two figures, shrouded in
cloaks and scarves.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a bit
nippy here." Ron's voice floated out from one of the shrouded
figures and Hermione, who had been scowling at a particularly
lopsided and tarnished candlestick, leapt to her feet and threw her
arms around him, not waiting for him to unwind the scarf or remove
his cloak.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let a man
breathe, Hermione," Ron mumbled. Bill chuckled as he shrugged off
his cloak and hung it by the back door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I love you too,"
Hermione said, still clinging tightly to his neck. Ron somehow
managed to extricate the scarf from his neck and face, the tips of
his ears red with embarrassment. He smiled sheepishly at Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Missed you," he
said softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Missed the
mistletoe too, you great git!" George called, pointing his
candlestick above Ron's head. Harry stifled a snort and Ginny
giggled as Ron's gloved hand gave George a two fingered salute and
he bent his head to kiss Hermione, heedless of his audience.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're still
he-ere!" George sang, several minutes later and Ron broke the kiss
to glare at his brother.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're ruining
this for me," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Take it into the
other room then," George said. "I don't want to lose my toast -
we just had breakfast."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh! Is there any
left?" Ron asked eagerly. Hermione gave him such a look of reproach
that he bent to kiss her again without another word.</p><p class="calibre8">The wedding
preparations were interrupted briefly by the news that Bill and Ron
had just come from Sirius House where they had delivered a
particularly special present to the Chumley's.</p><p class="calibre8">They'd found
Gilbert and Gerald's father.</p><p class="calibre8">"I mean he's not
quite the same as he was," Ron said as he tucked into a large roast
beef sandwich at the lunch table. "Splinched himself getting out of
the Ministry, he did, mangled up his left arm good and proper, but
he's still pretty handy with most things."</p><p class="calibre8">Ron and Bill had
uncovered a group of at least ten men who'd fled England and spent
the past week madly contacting the small groups of other witches and
wizards who were hidden and scattered across Europe and the Middle
East.</p><p class="calibre8">"They built up an
incredible hidden network," Bill explained. "But they'd hidden
themselves in the Muggle world so well none of them had been able to
verify the few vague rumours they'd heard about the end of the war.
Most of 'em were so badly frightened or injured that they couldn't
get home and check. None of them managed to hold down a Muggle job
long enough to do more than eat, let alone earn a plane fare and none
of 'em were willing to just land back in Diagon Alley or risk their
magic being tracked."</p><p class="calibre8">"They're all
coming home now?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Ron
answered, "Kingsley's givin' 'em all a hand and anyone we
know about should be home before New Year's."</p><p class="calibre8">The news of this
success dissipated any lingering tension and Ron and Bill's return,
together with Charlie's arrival from Romania, meant the Burrow
began to feel a lot more like Christmas. Charlie had arrived bearing
a new scorch mark on his neck and a sackful of Christmas gifts. The
only thing that marred the approaching festivities was the still
gaping, aching hole where Fred used to be.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">The afternoon before
George's wedding Bill suggested having a night out. Charlie
wholeheartedly agreed with Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, a night in
really," Charlie clarified, gesturing at the swirling snow. "Bit
cold out."</p><p class="calibre8">"A night in
where?" George asked from the couch in the Burrow's sitting room,
his head resting on Angelina's shoulder as he stroked her stomach
gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shell Cottage,"
Bill replied. "We'll all go there, just the lads. Leave the
ladies to do something … ladylike and have a few drinks."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a big
Muggle tradition," Charlie said from his seat near the fireplace.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is it really?"
Arthur asked excitedly, laying down his newspaper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah,"
Charlie said carelessly. "They reckon it's like a farewell to the
bachelor life. Call it a … buck's party I think."</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you do at
a buck's party?" Ron asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Drink and talk of
fine women," chortled Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sounds like a
brilliant plan!" Bill proclaimed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Eet sounds
ridiculous," said Fleur from the doorway, her arms were crossed and
she looked particularly put out. Harry heard Angelina snigger at the
look on Bill's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, but my dear
sister-in-law," Charlie said in an almost perfect imitation of
Professor Slughorn, "the ladies also have a gathering where they
discuss erm … lacy stuff and … um, other girl things."</p><p class="calibre8">"You weel never
get married Charlie," Fleur sniffed haughtily as she turned away
from him. "Beel, a word." As Bill scrambled to his feet George
chuckled softly and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why don't you
go, George?" Angelina asked quietly. "It sounds like fun and …
it's not everyday all your brothers are here." George's hand
stilled on her stomach and he closed his eyes. Angelina gasped and
covered her mouth with her hand; tears sparkled in the corners of her
eyes. George sat up straight and lifted a hand to her cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey," George
said softly. "No more crying." Angelina sniffed and nodded.
George kissed her tenderly. Harry looked away after only a few
seconds. It seemed like such a private moment but he was also
fascinated with watching the couples around him.</p><p class="calibre8">Uncle Vernon and
Aunt Petunia hadn't shown each other any particular affection.
They'd showered it on Dudley, of course, but they'd never done
more than peck each other on the cheek in front of him. Harry
secretly loved the way Molly and Arthur kissed unabashed in the
kitchen even though it made the rest of their children complain
loudly. He also liked watching Bill and Fleur hold hands at the
dinner table and the way Ron played with Hermione's hair while she
was reading.</p><p class="calibre8">George and Angelina
were different though. They were gentler with each other and their
moments seemed more private somehow, as if they were protecting
something fragile. But there was still something compelling in the
way they looked at each other and cared for one another. Harry
wondered if he looked at Ginny as tenderly as George looked at
Angelina; if he touched her as gently as Bill touched Fleur or spoke
to her as lovingly as Arthur spoke to Molly. He was stirred from his
thoughts by Ginny planting herself in his lap suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi!" she said
brightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi yourself,"
Harry replied with a smile. He gazed up at her for a moment. Her hair
was pulled back into a messy pony tail and there was a smudge on her
cheek from cleaning whichever random object her mother has assigned
for cleaning that afternoon, but she was still the most beautiful
woman he had ever seen. He couldn't help it; he reached a hand up
to her neck and pulled her down for a kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right, all
right," Ron grumbled loudly. "Fleur says we can go be manly at
Shell Cottage. Let's go before she changes her mind. You can resume
the kissing thing tomorrow." Harry felt a large hand pull on his
arm and he broke the kiss with Ginny with a growl.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi," he
grunted.</p><p class="calibre8">"No one likes to
be shown up like that," Ron said. "How you can express all that
passion without it looking sordid is beyond me. Sometimes I feel like
casting a cooling charm on myself just being in the same room when
you two look at each other." Harry blushed spectacularly and
glanced at Ginny as Ron hauled him towards the door.</p><p class="calibre8">She was grinning at
him and winked slowly. Ron shook his head and mumbled something about
impossible benchmarks and then they were out the door and Apparating
to Shell Cottage before Harry could even wonder that he and Ginny had
their own special way of telling the world that they were in love.</p><p class="calibre8">********************</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think it
matters that … we're ... you know …" George gestured vaguely
at his midriff.</p><p class="calibre8">"Expecting?"
Bill supplied. George nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Matters to who?"
asked Charlie refilling everyone's glasses.</p><p class="calibre8">"We decided to
make a go of it before we knew," George said absently. "Probably
would have been better if we weren't … you know …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Say it with me,
George … expecting," Bill chortled. George threw him a withering
look.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum and Dad had a
talk with me," George said conversationally.</p><p class="calibre8">"The same one
where they tell you to wait?" asked Ron. "I thought you already
had that one. Even Harry got that one." Charlie turned to look at
Harry and sniggered. Harry felt his face heat spectacularly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah we got that
one before Hogwarts," George replied. He continued in an uncanny
impression of his father. "Boys … you may start to notice girls …
when you do, you are in no way supposed to touch them prior to,
during or after the wedding unless you have my permission." Charlie
snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's not how
I remember it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes well you got
the Charlie designed talk," Bill said. "George here got the one
designed for the twins." George gestured rudely at his older
brother and resumed speaking.</p><p class="calibre8">"This was the 'we
are so disappointed in you' talk," George took a sip of
Firewhisky thoughtfully. "You know what they said to Angelina
though? 'Thanks for the grandkid, dear'!"</p><p class="calibre8">"They did not,"
Bill scoffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"They did so!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you know that
Dad tells you to wait and Mum tells you to be careful?" Ron asked
the room at large.</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you know?"
asked George lazily. "Did you get The Talk from Mum?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" Ron rolled
his eyes. "But Ginny did."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yep, that's
what Mum says," muttered Harry without thinking.</p><p class="calibre8">"And were you,
Potter?" Bill asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Was I ..?"
Harry asked, suddenly very aware of the silence in the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Were you
careful?" Charlie asked with a feral grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"If he's got any
sense he'll be careful not to tell you lot anything!" George said
with a leer. He winked exaggeratedly at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I rather liked
our father's advice on the subject," Percy interjected suddenly.
"When I get married-"</p><p class="calibre8">"You're going to
be pure, Perce," George proclaimed, raising his glass, "unlike
the rest of us degenerates!" He chuckled loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" Bill
protested from where he lay on the floor. Charlie threw a cushion at
his head. It was terribly wide of the mark and narrowly missed
bouncing into the fireplace.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you trying to
tell these young, impressionable brothers of ours that you didn't
…" Charlie waved a hand drunkenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have sex," Ron
supplied bluntly before tipping his Firewhisky down his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you, Ron,"
Charlie said. "Have sex, before you got married?" Bill eyed
Charlie carefully and blinked.</p><p class="calibre8">"I did not," he
said, enunciating every word, "have sex with my wife until after we
were married." He smiled smugly. Ron tilted his head. He wore an
expression of extreme thoughtfulness.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's only
because she wasn't your wife then," he eventually said with no
small degree of triumph. Bill grinned. George narrowed his eyes at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You had sex with
Fleur before you got married, I caught you that day behind the
chicken coop," George proclaimed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, George, but
she wasn't ihis wife/i," Charlie said, looking
horrified and swaying just a little. "She was just Fleur then."</p><p class="calibre8">"She has never
been just Fleur," Bill sighed, a dreamy look on his face. They sat
in silent contemplation for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"What if I'm
rubbish at it?" Percy said suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everyone is,"
George said morosely.</p><p class="calibre8">"They are?" Ron
asked. He raised an eyebrow. "How come everyone goes back for more
then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Even the worst
feels bloody good," George said sagely. "Unless you get too blind
drunk because you're scared witless and … aim wrong." He burst
out laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"George!" Percy
looked mortified and took another drink as if to wipe out the memory
of what his brother had just said.</p><p class="calibre8">"You didn't?"
Charlie groaned. "That's poor form, George."</p><p class="calibre8">"It wasn't me!"
George cried with mirth. "It was Fred!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Merlin," Ron
breathed. "You really did tell each other everything!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, he didn't
tell me that! Angelina did!" George hiccupped before falling
silent.</p><p class="calibre8">"What happens if
you … well if you aim wrong?" Percy suddenly asked. He looked
intently at George. "Is that bad?" Charlie made a choking sound.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Perce, it's
bad," Bill said seriously. "The witches don't like it!" He
punctuated every word with a finger stab to the air above him.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not too
bad if they love you," George said thoughtfully. "She let him try
again ..."</p><p class="calibre8">"I would be too
mortified-" Ron started.</p><p class="calibre8">"She loved him,"
George whispered, cutting him off. He stood up and swung around to
face his brothers and Harry. "She iloved/i him!
What am I doing? She loved ihim/i! She should be
marrying Fred, not me!" He lurched for the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"She can't ..."
Ron trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know she
can't!" George shouted. He whirled, nearly falling over, "because
he's DEAD!" Bill stood up and wove across the room unsteadily.</p><p class="calibre8">"George ..." he
trailed off and put his arms around his younger brother. George stood
stiffly for a moment before he clutched at Bill and began to cry.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry stared into
the fire. He felt sort of warm and removed from reality. He was glad.
Part of him knew Firewhisky was not the way to deal with this pain
and loss but the greater part of him was glad. He hoped they wouldn't
all be paying for it in the morning.</p><p class="calibre8">The six of them sat
quietly after George eventually stopped crying, he and Bill leaning
drunkenly against one another near the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think
he'll forgive me?" George asked suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who?" Charlie
answered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred …"</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you need
forgiveness for?" Ron looked at George with a frown.</p><p class="calibre8">"She was his
girl." No one seemed to have an answer for that. They sat in
silence again for a long time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is she happy?"
Percy asked after a while. "Because if she's happy then ... I
reckon that's all that Fred wants. I want Penelope to be happy and
if Roger Davies makes her happy, then …"</p><p class="calibre8">"You still want to
pound the little snot into the ground," Bill grunted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," mused
Percy, "bad example."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't reckon
you have anything to answer to," Charlie said suddenly. "If
you're happy and she's happy and Fred's dead, well-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Charlie!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well he is!"
Charlie insisted in a rather slurred tone. "If Bill here got dead
I'd be happy to cheer Fleur up!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You are so drunk
right now or there is no way you'd be saying that," Bill pointed
a finger at him lazily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just mean …"
Charlie waved an arm and came dangerously close to unseating a
crystal vase on a nearby side table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred would be
happy for you," Ron said. "That's what he means. He would want
you to be with her if it makes you both happy."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's what I
mean," Charlie confirmed with a nod and a swig of Firewhisky.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just make her
happy. I reckon that's all he'd want," Bill said. He peered at
George. "Are you happy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," George
replied. "I am with her, anyway."</p><p class="calibre8">"And not just
because she's a good shag," Percy supplied drunkenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You bring
everything back to sex," Ron complained.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're just
grumpy because you've not had any," Charlie ribbed him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not because he
hasn't tried, I bet," chuckled George.</p><p class="calibre8">"For your
information," Ron said loftily, "I happen to have had some
experience of a sexual nature and I'll thank you to keep your nose
out of it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Good luck,"
snorted Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's that
mean, Potter?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You couldn't
keep your noses out of other people's sex lives for love or money,"
Harry muttered, propping his feet up on Fleur's carefully polished
coffee table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fleur will end
yours if you don't get your feet off of there," Bill commented.
Harry hastily removed his feet, stretching them out underneath the
precious piece of furniture.</p><p class="calibre8">"He'd have to
have one to end," Charlie commented, taking a swig of Firewhisky
from the bottle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe he does,"
Ron muttered darkly. George lurched to his feet, and took the bottle
from Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are all too
drunk to do anything about it anyway," George said, sitting heavily
on the coffee table in front of Harry swaying dangerously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thass true,"
said Percy as he put his glass down unsteadily and loosened his tie.</p><p class="calibre8">"How many has he
had?" George asked, watching Percy attempt to untie his shoelaces.
"Just pull 'em off, Perce!" Percy eyed George haughtily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Being a little …
having had ssssomething to drink dosh not mean one should ignore
bashic sssshoecare," he slurred. George rolled his eyes at him and
turned back to Harry, pouring a generous helping of Firewhisky into
his glass.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, Harry,"
George said, splashing a little more of the alcoholic liquid into his
own, "who won the bet?" Harry stared at him in silence, a red
heat creeping up his neck and onto his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Which bet?" he
said casually, taking a sip of his drink. His heart hammered in his
chest. Ginny's brothers all suddenly looked unbearably
ilarge/i. The Firewhisky burned as it slid down his
throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know which
bet," Ron grumbled. "Now answer the question so I can go and
iObliviate/i myself."</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't
iObliviate/i yourshelf, Ronald," Percy said, his
face inches from his shoelaces.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up, Perce,"
Ron said idly. Percy kept silent, meticulously unpicking the knot in
his shoelaces.</p><p class="calibre8">"I lost,"
Charlie said. "I had first Quidditch win and since you spent that
in the hospital wing …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know I already
lost," Bill commented. "Ginny told me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny told you?"
Harry asked nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wasn't before
you went back to school," Bill clarified. He stood up and wandered
over, picking up the bottle of Firewhisky and upending it into his
glass. It was empty. Charlie frowned at the bottle but George leaned
forward, his face inches from Harry's.</p><p class="calibre8">"Please tell me
the first event wasn't before Hallowe'en," George said. "I
don't want to give Ron here the winnings." Harry shook his head
soundlessly. He searched frantically for a way to get out of there
but his limbs felt pleasantly heavy from the Firewhisky he'd
consumed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ha!" George
crowed, standing unsteadily. "I knew it would take her longer than
that to convince him to give it up!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not by much,"
Harry said, horrified at the words that tumbled, unbidden out of his
mouth. He snapped it shut, growing redder by the minute, before he
accidentally said anything else.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well," George
said, "I believe, gentlemen, that I win!"</p><p class="calibre8">"When was it,
Harry?" Bill asked, slumped awkwardly in one of the armchairs.
Harry eyed him warily but said nothing.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are so lucky
we are too drunk to beat you up," Charlie commented idly. His
brothers grunted. Harry thanked his lucky stars.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry staggered
downstairs the next morning. Ron was still snoring in his bed on the
other side of the orange-walled bedroom they still shared. As he went
past Fred and George's old room he trailed his hand across it.
George had told him the room was his as soon as the wedding was over.
He and Angelina were moving into the flat above the shop after their
brief honeymoon.</p><p class="calibre8">As he entered the
kitchen he could see Bill and Charlie sitting at the table, their
heads propped on their hands. Percy was standing at the stove
stirring a small cauldron which was giving off rather noxious
smelling fumes. George was sitting in a chair near the fireplace,
hunched over and moaning. Harry sidled into the room carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hurry up, Perce,"
George moaned. "My head's about to split in two!"</p><p class="calibre8">"One would think
you'd be used to it," Percy said as he carefully measured
something into the cauldron. George lifted his head and glared at his
older brother.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll have you
know I stopped the drinking a couple months ago," he growled. "Once
I had to clean up Ron I realised how stupid I was being."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is Ron up yet?"
Bill mumbled into his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Harry
answered him. Bill jerked his head up and then winced dramatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Potter," he
grunted before laying his head on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"How'd we get
here?" Harry asked as he sat down carefully, not daring to move his
fragile head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fleur came home
and Flooed Dad to come and get us all," Bill said. "I remember
enough to know that he told us we'd be sorry in the morning."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you …
remember anything else?" Harry asked tentatively. Charlie turned to
look at him carefully. Harry squirmed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are so lucky
we are too hung over to beat you up," was all he said.</p>
