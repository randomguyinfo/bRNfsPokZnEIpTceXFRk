<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_5">*Chapter 4*: Chapter 4</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Mrs Weasley's Grief</strong></p><p class="calibre8">"Where. Have.
You. <em class="calibre9">BEEN</em>?"
Mrs Weasley's shrill voice rang through the Entrance Hall. "I
sent you to find your sister and bring her <em class="calibre9">straight</em>
in to dinner, not take a leisurely walk in the grounds! You've been
gone for ages! How was I supposed to know where you were? What if
something had happened to you? Do you KNOW how long you've been
<em class="calibre9">GONE</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Now Molly,
they are adults and quite capable of looking after themselves,"
said Mr Weasley, coming up behind her as her children cowered in
front of her, Harry doing a particularly good job of hiding behind
Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are they,
Arthur? Are they? You don't know that! You don't know what's
out there, lurking in the dark! And last time – last time I let
them out of my sight – last time …"Mrs Weasley trailed off and
began to cry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Last time
Fred didn't come back," she whispered. George let out a quiet
whimper and turned away and Harry saw Bill's arm tighten around
him. Mrs Weasley was crying in earnest now and wringing her hands. Mr
Weasley pulled his wife into his arms swiftly, trying to calm her.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're sorry
mum," said Charlie softly. "We didn't mean to make you worry."</p><p class="calibre8">"You could say
we got a little side tracked though," muttered Ron. Hermione
elbowed him in the ribs and glared.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mother, our
humble apologies for making you worry. I am afraid we did not realise
the length of time we had taken while locating Ginevra," Percy
added.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not that Ginny
was ever lost," Ron snorted. "Not like she was in any danger,
except of making me vomit."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron Weasley,
you have no tact whatsoever!" Hermione hissed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum," said
Bill gently. "I'm sorry you were worried. We really will be more
careful in the future."</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs Weasley
turned to look at Bill, noticing George for the first time. Bill's
strong arm had trapped his younger brother, tears streaming down his
face, looking as if he might flee as soon as Bill released his grip.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Georgie,"
she whispered, reaching over and gathering him into her arms. "I'm
sorry, I'm so sorry." She stood there, rocking her son while he
cried in her arms and one by one her other children joined her, the
Weasley family drawing strength from each other and supporting each
other. Harry turned to Hermione who looked at him sadly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wish my
parents were here," she whispered, looking mournful. Harry pulled
her into a hug, reflecting that perhaps he was getting rather more
used to crying females but wishing at the same time he'd gotten the
experience another way.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll go and
bring them home soon Hermione, as soon as we possibly can," Harry
whispered softly to her, so as not to disturb the grieving family.
Hermione whispered her thanks into her shirt as she succumbed to
tears and Harry stood with her in his arms, rubbing her back softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi, Potter!
Get your hands off my girl!" Harry started at Ron's voice and
Hermione turned swiftly. But Ron was smiling and Harry laughed and
playfully squeezed her tighter. The Weasleys all turned around at
this exchange, George wiping his eyes and taking a quick look at his
mother.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ho, ho ickle
Ronniekins," George began, "you've spilled it in front of mum
now!" Mrs Weasley was looking from Ron to Hermione, who had pulled
free of Harry's grasp.</p><p class="calibre8">"When did this
happen?" Mrs Weasley asked with a rather watery smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right after
Ron opened the Chamber of Secrets and right before we ran into Crabbe
who tried to burn us alive," said Harry matter-of-factly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are hiding
quite a bit there, Potter, aren't you?" Charlie said, looking at
Harry in amazement. "Full of secrets aren't we?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," said
Harry, shaking his head,"you have no idea."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're right
Harry," broke in George. "It is going to be fun taking the mickey
out of Ron; something to look forward to." Hermione smiled at
George as he suddenly burst into watery laughter at the disgruntled
look on Ron's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why can't
you pick on Harry?" Ron complained. "I don't know why you can't
concentrate on embarrassing him for all eternity!"</p><p class="calibre8">The Weasleys
stood with their arms draped around each other or linked together as
Ron and George entered a good natured debate about the merits of
mocking Ron about his new relationship and Harry marveled at their
ability to carry each other from bad moments to good and be there
when the next bad moment came. As his eyes roamed over the ones he
knew as family they came to rest on Ginny who was looking decidedly
pale and staring at Ron fixedly before her eyes briefly flickered to
Harry's and it was then he saw the deep pain reflected in them; and
the confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron, how did
you open the Chamber?" she asked so softly Harry could barely hear
her. Everybody froze. Harry held his breath, she looked so pained as
though every bad memory she ever had was being dredged up. Ron sucked
in his breath and glanced at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's heard
me speak Parseltongue loads of times, Ginny," Harry volunteered,
hoping this would be enough for now, hoping he wouldn't have to
explain further. Ginny turned her gaze on him but it was rapidly
becoming one of frustration bordering on fury and Harry took a step
back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes, you go
around telling things to open in Parseltongue all the time!" she
exclaimed. "You hate talking in Parseltongue. You never do it
unless you have to. You avoid snakes, Harry! So yeah, sure Ron
remembers 'open' from five years ago! How does he know it? What
happened to him?" Ron looked in horror at Ginny and then to Harry
and Hermione. No one else seemed able to move.</p><p class="calibre8">"He really did
learn it from hearing me do it, but no, not from five years ago,"
Harry took a tentative step towards her. "I had to open something
with Parseltongue recently. Ron was there. Nothing's happened to
him Ginny. He's safe. We're all safe now. <em class="calibre9">He's</em>
gone, he can't hurt anyone else. No one is going to open the
Chamber again." Harry held his breath. Ginny seemed on the verge of
hysteria now. Before anyone could react she suddenly took off out of
the Entrance Hall and in the direction of the second floor, Harry
tore after her and he could hear the Weasleys thundering after them.</p><p class="calibre8">Moments later
Harry burst, gasping, into Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Ginny stood
in front of the open entrance to the Chamber of Secrets, shaking.
Harry pulled her into an embrace, stroking her hair and whispering
that it was going to be all right. The rest of the Weasleys and
Hermione arrived, puffing, at the door to the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Close it,
Harry," Ginny begged, her voice shrill and hysterical. Harry told
the entrance to close, but nothing happened.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er, mate,"
said Ron, "that was English." Harry tried again. Nothing
happened.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't
speak Parseltongue anymore," he whispered. Harry was stunned,
events began turning over in his brain and he saw Hermione looking at
him. She was thinking.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was part of
Voldemort," she began, "he left, well … it in you the first
time he tried to kill you and the second time he used the Killing
Curse on you he ripped it out again and it took the Parseltongue with
it. The Parseltongue was part of it." Mrs Weasley shrieked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry James
Potter! What do you mean he used the Killing Curse on you?" Mrs
Weasley looked livid with rage.</p><p class="calibre8">"Killing
Curse?" whispered Ginny. He hadn't mentioned that earlier, they
had avoided talk of exactly <em class="calibre9">how</em>
he died, trying to cope with their feelings about it. Harry held onto
her as she began shaking, stroking her back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm okay, I
promise," he whispered in her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Has anyone
checked you over? Have you been to see Poppy? Are you all right?"
demanded Mrs Weasley as she darted over and began checking him over.
Harry began to protest.</p><p class="calibre8">"See, no
possible way of mocking Harry," George said shaking his head sadly.
"You don't mock someone who's survived the Killing Curse twice.
You just can't do that. But we can, and we should, celebrate that.
With fireworks!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Can we do that
after dinner?" asked Ron. "Let's go eat. McGonagall can come
here later and seal that up some other way Ginny." Ginny nodded,
she was still pale and hadn't completely stopped shaking so Harry
kept his arm around her as they traipsed out into the hallway and
towards the Great Hall, Mrs Weasley continued to fuss over Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,
Mrs Weasley," he protested in vain as she continued to poke and
prod at him and ask him if this was tender or that was sore. "Really
I'm just fine. I don't need to go to the hospital wing. Mrs
Weasley … really, Mrs Weasley – MUM! Stop!"She turned to stare
at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry," he
said sheepishly. "I didn't mean to shout." Mrs Weasley looked
tearfully up at him before gathering him in a bone-crushing hug
stopping the mini procession. He heard Ginny giggle as he struggled
to breathe and was relieved that she was starting to feel better.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum! Come on,
let the man go, let's eat!" called Ron. "Harry, do you think
you can bond with her after dinner?" Mrs Weasley released her grip
and patted Harry softly on the cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on, let's
go feed you up," she said. "Have you been eating properly? You
are looking awfully thin."</p>
