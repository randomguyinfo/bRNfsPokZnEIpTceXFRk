<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_7">*Chapter 6*: Chapter 6</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">George's
Grief</strong></p><p class="calibre8">As he waited for
Ginny to return with her brothers Harry found his eyes constantly
wandering to Teddy. Fleur was making faces at the baby who was
staring at her solemnly. He watched as Neville moved over to sit next
to Fleur and talk to the infant. Little Teddy began shifting his gaze
between the two of them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why don't
you go over and be with Teddy?" asked Hermione softly. Harry shook
his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why not?"
Hermione asked. "Just go and be with him, he needs you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know he
needs me," Harry looked at her sadly. "I don't know if I can do
it, Hermione. I don't know if I can be strong for him. If I go over
there, what if I break down again? What if every time he sees me I'm
a blubbering mess?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, you're
hardly prone to being a blubbering mess."</p><p class="calibre8">"But … it
hurts, Hermione," Harry said softly. "I don't know if I can
keep doing … oh I'm so weak, why can't I just go over there? I
can't make myself go over there. What's wrong with me?" Harry
began to pull away from her, wrapping his arms around himself and
looking at Teddy who was still watching Neville intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on, I'll
come with you, "Hermione offered, extending her hand. Harry shrank
away from her. He was saved from further efforts to get him to move
closer to Teddy by the re-entrance of the Weasley children, each
carrying a rather large, orange box with WWW written across the sides
in large print. Hermione was immediately distracted.</p><p class="calibre8">"What have you
got there?" she demanded, rather suspiciously in Harry's opinion.
"What are you about to do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Calm down,
Hermione," protested Ron. "McGonagall just said don't damage
anything and this is not going to damage anything. Rather perk
everyone up I'd say, wouldn't you George?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Right you are
little brother!" replied George. "Beneficial is what I would call
the contents of these boxes." Harry looked away, back to Teddy.
Fleur was passed him to Neville who held the baby rather
uncomfortably but he smiled as he looked down at the infant and said
something to Fleur that made her laugh and coo at the baby.</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville's
got himself a girl magnet there," said Charlie slyly.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
definitely something attractive about a baby," replied Bill, whose
eyes were fixed on Fleur. His thoughts were clearly not fixed on the
baby if the look in his eyes was anything to go by.</p><p class="calibre8">"Excuse me, but
do you think I could put this box down now?" demanded Ginny. "If
you great lumps can get out of the way, I can put it on the table."
Murmuring apologies, her brothers made way for her to put the box she
was carrying on the table. As she relinquished her load she spotted
Harry, arms still wrapped around himself, staring at little Teddy
Lupin, tears threatening to break from his eyes and spill down his
cheeks. She sat down next to him and placed her hand on his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, are you
all right?" Harry didn't look at her, he watched Neville tickle
the baby's tummy. Teddy didn't respond. He didn't laugh, simply
stared up at Neville with his big eyes and reached his tiny fingers
out to bat Neville on the nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's sad,"
Harry whispered softly. "He knows his mum and dad are gone and he
can't work out where they went and why they haven't come back. He
misses her. He's going to miss her for the rest of his life."</p><p class="calibre8">"At least he
won't remember her," said George, putting his box down next to
Ginny's. "No idea what he's missing really."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, he'll
know what he's missing; every day." Harry turned to George. "When
all the other kids have mums and dads to pick them up from school,
he'll know what he's missing. Every mother's day, every
father's day," Harry's voice was getting louder, "he'll
know what he's missing. And it'll hurt, all the time. And some
days it won't matter that he knows they did it for him, so that he
would be safe, because some days all you want is for them to be here
with you because you miss them." He stopped, breathing hard.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well at least
he's got no memories to torment him, every time he turns a corner,
expecting them to turn up," George retorted. "Can't really miss
it if you never had it; can't miss hearing their voice, seeing them
laugh. Can't miss him giving you a hug if you never remembered when
he was here!" The entire occupants of the Great Hall were looking
at them now. Harry stood up, furious, tipping his chair over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course you
can miss something you never had! When everyone around you has got it
and you know you had it once," yelled Harry, clenching his fists.
He wasn't talking about Teddy anymore, this was all about Harry and
the pain he was feeling and unable to hold in anymore. Mr Weasley
stood up and put out a restraining hand, his remaining sons appeared
frozen, holding the big boxes, their heads whipping from George to
Harry like they were watching a Muggle tennis match. Ginny and Mrs
Weasley were staring at them in horror and Hermione, tears glistening
in her eyes stood shocked, her hand over her mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're not
haunted by memories, hearing things that remind you of him, not if
you never had him in the first place," George argued. "You're
not paralysed with fear in the middle of the night because you don't
know how to go on without them. Not if you never had them there, by
your side for all your life. Yeah at least he won't know what he's
missing out on."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you just
try it, George!" Harry hissed. "You just try it! Take the one
person who knows you better than anyone else, who's been there all
your life! The one person who's been with you since before you were
BORN! Take them away and then try and tell me I don't know what I'm
missing!" There was a collective gasp. Harry knew a split second
too late what he'd said. He knew what he'd said only after the
cruel words had fled his mouth in pain and in anger and grief. He
would have done anything to take them back, to make them unsaid. He
saw the pain etched on George's features and wished with all his
heart he could take it back. Distantly he heard Teddy begin to cry.
Fleur's voice was the only one that broke the silence, shushing the
baby and trying to comfort him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You did take
him away," whispered George. His voice rose as he continued, "He's
gone now and he's never coming back. I know exactly how it feels to
miss someone so badly to know you're never going to see them ever
again, talk to them, feel their touch. I know what it feels like and
I would rather never have known what it was like because this hurts
too much!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't
know that," Harry said softly, with steel in his voice. "You
don't mean that. It hurts just as bad when you never knew what it
was like for them to hold you when you cried." His face was flushed
and angry, the two of them stood there staring each other in the
face, holding their anger and grief over each other's head like a
bargaining tool.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I do mean
that," said George menacingly. "You have no idea. No idea how I
feel!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe not
exactly," spat Harry, "but don't you dare tell me I don't
know how it feels to lose someone, that I don't know what I am
missing just because I never knew them. They're all gone! All of
them! There is no one left, no one to tell me about them, share
stories with me and fill in the gaps. No one left who knew them, no
one left who can share them with me because there's no one left who
shared those experiences with them. No one left who was there was I
was born, who was there on my first birthday. It's missing, it's
all missing and who's going to fill it in now?" his anger was
deflating. He slumped and looked down at the ground. He missed the
look on George's face; he missed the fact that George had drawn his
wand; he missed the curse that flew his way. He heard only George
hissing before the room spun as he fell to the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"You think you
can fill his place? You shouldn't even have survived! Why couldn't
I still have Fred instead of you!" Harry's vision blurred and his
pulse beat faster. He heard screams and swearing and then sobbing as
he lay there trying to clear his head. Hermione's head swam into
view, her mouth moving but he could not work out what she was saying
and then Mr Weasley was there a concerned look on his face, but Harry
couldn't look at him. He'd hurt George, how could he look any of
the Weasleys in the eye? Harry turned his head, closing his eyes and
trying to move his body to curl into a ball.</p><p class="calibre8">He felt someone
touch his shoulder and he shrank away from them. How could anyone
bear to touch him after what he'd just said? Why was anyone with
him anyway, they should just leave him alone and help George, poor
George who had lost so much so recently. Let's face it, he, Harry,
should be dead and nobody else should have died. Voldemort was only
after him. He'd lived with his losses for years surely he could
deal with it by now, keep it in check and not turn on George for whom
the wound was still so raw, so fresh? The world was still spinning
and blackness began to cloud the edges of his vision as he finally
managed to curl up on his side and he didn't fight the blackness as
it overtook him. He sank gratefully into the oblivion it provided.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">"How could you
do that to him?" the voice shrieked. "He's your friend! How
could you, after everything he's been through! There was no need to
do that. No need." The voice trailed off sobbing and Harry was glad
it had because his head was pounding as though a freight train had
run through his head instead of the level crossing at Little
Whinging. Harry searched his brain for an explanation of why he was
lying on a cold floor with a woman's shrill voice screaming through
his head and why he felt the need to agree with the voice. The voice
was right, he didn't need to do that he'd been completely wrong.
He wasn't sure what about exactly but he knew instinctively he'd
said something wrong.</p><p class="calibre8">Thinking hurt and
he groaned, trying to move his head and failing miserably. He brought
his hands up to cradle his head but his hands were caught by someone
else's.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhh, Harry,
lay still. Madam Pomfrey's coming with something for your head,"
said a soft voice from above him. "No, don't try to talk, its
okay."</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione, thought
Harry, that's Hermione. He groaned again and cracked his eyes open
to see Hermione bending over him and Ron hovering over her shoulder
looking at him with concern.</p><p class="calibre8">"You all right
mate?" asked Ron. "Anything hurt apart from your head? You took a
nasty fall after you hit the table with your head. Bleeding's
stopped, but I'll not be surprised if you have a whopper of a
headache right now." Harry blinked at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What – what
happened?" he asked. Ron shifted uncomfortably and in the silence
Harry could hear the low rumble of voices, at least one baby crying
and two people sobbing loudly from somewhere nearby while several
people were making various shushing sounds.</p><p class="calibre8">"You got
knocked out when you got hit by a spell and whacked your head on the
table when you fell," said Hermione briskly. "How are you
feeling?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Like I've
been hit by a Bludger," said Harry wincing at the sound of his own
voice. "Who on earth wants to throw spells at me now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh look,
here's Madam Pomfrey," said Ron, moving aside to allow the matron
through. Harry got the distinct impression that he was avoiding the
question.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mr Potter, I
was under the impression that you did not need to visit my Hospital
Wing," she started briskly, "but here we are, let me look at
you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I am still
under the impression that I do not need to visit your Hospital Wing,"
grumbled Harry. He did allow her to check his head thoroughly and
mend the wound there. After making him drink a foul tasting pain
potion she proclaimed that he would be best off spending the night in
the Hospital Wing.</p><p class="calibre8">"But-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry
Mr Potter," Madam Pomfrey interrupted, forestalling his protest.
"You don't have to go there given that it is too full in any
case. I will leave you in the capable hands of Mr Weasley and Ms
Granger." The hospital matron bustled away. As the pain potion
began to take effect the fog in his head cleared and Harry remembered
exactly what had happened. He closed his eyes and shrank away from
Hermione's concerned embrace.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't
believe I said that to George," he whispered to no one in
particular, drawing his knees up to his chest. He shrugged off the
hand somebody laid on his shoulder and put his head down and began to
weep softly, mortified and horrified at his own actions. No wonder he
agreed with the shrieking voice, how could he do that to George?</p><p class="calibre8">"No-ooo," he
moaned as someone firmly gripped his shoulders and pulled him into a
hug. He struggled briefly but the other person was too strong for him
and as he broke down he dimly realised that he was gripped in one of
Mrs Weasley's bone crushing hugs. As she rocked him and stroked his
hair, whispering soft words into his ear Harry cried tears he did not
know he had left and let a mother's love truly envelope him for the
first time in living memory.</p>
