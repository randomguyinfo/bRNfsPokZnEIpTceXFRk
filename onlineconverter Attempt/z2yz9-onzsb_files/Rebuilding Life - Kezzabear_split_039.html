<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_40">*Chapter 39*: Chapter 39</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
39. Surprises</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The cold November
days gave way to even colder December days. Mrs Chumley replied to
Harry's letter quickly, accepting the position in the new
Children's Home and Harry finished the paperwork and sent it in to
the Ministry. It was the first Friday in December when Harry had
explained that the orphaned students had somewhere to go for the
Christmas holidays. Professor McGonagall had thrown her arms around
him in a very uncharacteristic display.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are a
wonderful, wonderful young man," the professor had mumbled into his
shoulder before patting him on the back and turning away to wipe her
eyes surreptitiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, Professor, I
was sort of wondering …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Mr Potter?"
Professor McGonagall smiled warmly at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was wondering
... I've got a bit of business to finalise and I need to speak to
Molly, er, Mrs Weasley and …" Harry trailed off not sure to ask
for what he wanted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Miss Weasley
could use some time with her mother," Professor McGonagall said
briskly. "I think, Mr Potter, it would be a good idea if she
accompanied you this weekend."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I expect you both
back before tea on Sunday," Professor McGonagall said before
turning back to the paperwork on her desk. "I'll let our students
know they have a … home."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry slipped out of
the headmistress's office and bounded down the spiral staircase, in
a hurry to tell Ginny she could come home with him for the weekend.
Ginny had been helping him with his ointment but things just weren't
the same as they had been.</p><p class="calibre8">After Harry and
Ginny had worked things out the previous weekend and gone to the
Quidditch match to watch Ravenclaw soundly thrash Hufflepuff, they
had gone for a walk. After a quick afternoon tea with Hagrid they had
played with Dora for a while before being drawn into a rather rowdy
game of Monopoly in the common room. They hadn't really been alone
or returned to the kind of urgency that they had experienced in the
Potions classroom. It was as if things were … delicate.</p><p class="calibre8">To everyone else
Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley looked and behaved like any other
young couple. They held hands in the corridors between classes, gave
chaste goodbye kisses outside classrooms when they had to part and
studied together in the library or the common room. They sat together
during meals and took walks down by the lake, rugged up against the
winter chill.</p><p class="calibre8">But it felt
different to Harry. At some place inside there was a wall that they
pretended wasn't really there. The wall stopped them talking about
their future. Once they had always talked about the future; made
plans and shared dreams. Now they talked carefully about the here and
now; schoolwork, the looming completion of the Children's Home and
what Hermione could possibly be hiding. The wall stopped their hands.
Once they had let their hands and mouths wander freely, giving and
receiving affection openly, searching for places to be alone. Now
they caressed tentatively, hesitantly; sitting with their friends,
avoiding the dark, secret places the castle had to offer. There
hadn't been anything but chaste goodbye kisses and brief goodnight
kisses.</p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't that
Harry didn't want to resume their physical relationship he just
didn't know how to get over the wall. Despite the initial urgent
feelings, their misunderstanding had put up barriers to intimacy.
Most of all Harry missed the feeling that Ginny Weasley was his
future. He wondered if he should talk to Arthur, but the idea of
telling Arthur he and Ginny had been intimate wasn't very
appealing. Harry hoped Ginny would choose to talk to her mother and
that would work.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry arrived back
at the common room to find Ginny and Dean sprawled on the hearth rug,
scowling over their Muggle Studies assignment.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm telling
you, Ginny, this <em class="calibre9">is</em> a really popular story," Dean said
exasperatedly. "They made it into a movie and everything."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a load of
rubbish," Ginny said hotly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I know it's
not realistic-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Understatement,"
Ginny said, rolling her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's the
<em class="calibre9">point</em>," Dean bellowed suddenly. "It's not supposed to be
realistic!"</p><p class="calibre8">"There's no need
to shout at me," Ginny said, glaring at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What story are
you analysing?" Harry asked flopping onto the nearby couch. The
Muggle Studies assignment was to take a Muggle produced story or
conception about witches and compare it with the reality. Muggleborn
students or those with a Muggle parent had been paired up with
purebloods to complete the essay. To her dismay, Hermione had been
paired with Draco Malfoy. Harry had been relieved to find himself
partnering Neville Longbottom and they'd chosen an odd-looking book
about a school for witches full of illustrations of black pointed
hats and broomsticks.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Wizard of …
Oz," said Ginny, squinting at the parchment. "I mean the wizard
isn't even a real wizard so what's the point?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's the
point of the story," Harry answered absently as Arnold the Pygmy
Puff rolled off the arm of the chair and into his lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"See," Dean said
smugly. "Harry gets it." Ginny scowled and flipped the book open,
slapping it on the floor as if it had personally offended her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Every kid loved
that movie," Dean said, rolling onto his back and staring up at the
ceiling, hands clasped behind his head. "We used to get to stay up
and watch it when it came on TV, then Mum bought us the video. Just
about wore that tape out. How many times did you see the movie,
Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Just once,"
Harry answered quietly, not wanting to add that he'd had to hide
behind the couch and watch it between the pieces of furniture. When
Uncle Vernon had found him there at the end of it Harry had been
locked back in the cupboard and missed at least two meals. The movie
had never been allowed on again.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny looked up at
him, gazing intently and Harry developed a sudden and intense
interest in Arnold. Dean did not appear to notice anything amiss.</p><p class="calibre8">"See that's the
point, Ginny," Dean continued. "The real magic didn't come from
the wizard; Dorothy found the real magic where there were people who
loved her."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny muttered
something under her breath but ceased arguing. Harry glowered at Dean
who looked smug.</p><p class="calibre8">"So we should be
able to knock this over this weekend," Dean said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well actually …"
Harry stopped, not wanting to discuss his plans – their plans –
in front of Dean.</p><p class="calibre8">"Perhaps I already
have plans, Dean," Ginny said irritably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, come on."
Dean rolled his eyes. "You never do anything but play Quidditch and
study." Ginny glared at him before she shoved some of the parchment
and a quill in her bag. She stood up and dropped the novel onto
Dean's stomach as she stalked over and scooped Arnold out of
Harry's grasp.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny …"
Harry leapt out of his seat as she strode to the girls' staircase.
Ginny ignored him and took the stairs two at a time. Harry watched
her disappear from sight and then turned to Dean who shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bit tetchy, isn't
she?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You idiot,"
Harry hissed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Reckon she could
use a good shag," Dean continued blithely. "Get rid of some of
that tension. I'm sure you're up for it-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up," Harry
growled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh maybe you
could both use-" Dean never finished his sentence because Harry
flicked a Silencing charm at him as he stalked towards the boys'
dormitory staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was in the
middle of throwing his clothes for the weekend into a bag when the
door creaked open slowly and Ginny sidled inside. She shut the door
with a quiet click and stood uncertainly at the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you going
away this weekend?" Ginny asked. Harry heard the accusation in her
voice. He stopped abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was going to
speak to you about that before Dean interrupted," Harry began.
Ginny sighed and turned around, one hand on the doorknob.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
when you get back," she said as she pulled the door open. Harry
leapt across the room hurriedly. He realised that if he didn't
speed up his explanation he would be in all sorts of strife. He
reached the door just before she slipped around it and managed to get
one hand out to slam it shut. The doorknob jerked out of Ginny's
hand and Harry leaned on the door, his heart beating rapidly.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny shrank away
from him and Harry cursed inwardly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
he said. "I didn't mean to startle you." Ginny shook her head
slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay I
just … I don't like being trapped."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry." Harry
pulled his hand away from the door as if scalded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Goyle used to do
that when I would leave a detention," Ginny said softly. "He used
to … insinuate things."</p><p class="calibre8">"Like what?"
Harry's eyes narrowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think he was
sexually confused," Ginny replied with a smirk. Harry raised an
eyebrow. "He could never seem to remember that I wasn't sexually
interested in servicing members of Slytherin house."</p><p class="calibre8">"He must have been
confused, I thought he was …" Harry waved a hand loosely in the
air.</p><p class="calibre8">"He was soliciting
for other people," Ginny admitted quietly. "He would usually
offer a reprieve from Cruciatus in return for … sexual favours. I
never took him up on it so he'd always try again at the end of it.
Neville would usually force the door back open and he'd back off.
When you slammed the door it just reminded me." Ginny shrugged and
looked at the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"S'okay,"
Ginny mumbled. Harry stood uncertainly for a moment. He had an insane
urge to punch Goyle's face in. Sensing that Ginny didn't want to
dwell on the memory, Harry swallowed heavily and forced himself to
talk about something else.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was going to
say, um … before, downstairs, I was going to say that McGonagall
said you could come with me this weekend," Harry stammered. Ginny
looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" she
asked incredulously. "You want me to come?" Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course I do,"
he said. "I have a couple things to do, er, for the Children's
Home. I was hoping you'd come to Grimmauld Place with me." Ginny
wrinkled her nose. Harry hastily added, "If you don't want to
that's fine."</p><p class="calibre8">"No, no I'd like
to," Ginny assured him. "It's just … I never liked that
place."</p><p class="calibre8">"Me either,"
Harry admitted. "We stayed there last year and I … it was better
but I think I'm glad I found a use for it apart from living in it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Were you going to
live there?" Ginny asked him. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know,"
Harry admitted. "I haven't given a lot of thought to where we'd
live, it's just, if you have a house … isn't that what you do
with it, usually?" Ginny shrugged and looked at the floor again.
Harry continued. "I did think perhaps we could get somewhere big
enough to play Quidditch."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny looked up at
him, her expression unreadable, and Harry felt as though he could
reach out and touch the wall between them. Angrily he began to hurl
words at it, battering at it and determined to hammer at it until it
crumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because I want to
live in a house in the country," he started. Ginny's eyes went
wide as Harry began waving his arms wildly. "With you. I don't
want to live in some house in the middle of London, miles from your
family. I want room for our children to grow up. Where they can run
and play. Maybe we can have one of those cottages where those vines
grow all over it, with one of those little attic rooms and a
vegetable patch.</p><p class="calibre8">"I want room for
Teddy to stay over and a Quidditch pitch for you to practice on so
you can follow your dreams and so I can beat Charlie to the Snitch. I
want it to have a kitchen with mismatched chairs around a big old
table and a front porch where we can sit and watch the sun go down.
And it should have one room where Ron can beat me at chess and it'll
have a big old squashy armchair in the corner where Hermione likes to
read and a basket for Dora in the corner and … and a big fluffy rug
where we can make love in front of the fire."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny stared at him
and Harry swallowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm tired of
pretending I don't want that," Harry explained. "All I want is
a place for me and you and our family."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why would you
pretend you don't want that?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because … it's
…" Harry stopped, unable to express what he meant. If he admitted
wanting to spend the rest of his life with Ginny, even though he knew
it was undeniably true, he'd be admitting that he wanted to marry
her and while he knew that – had even said that – the picture of
his life was somehow more explicit than mere words. If her family
knew that he had them pictured in a cosy little house with children
and a rug in front of the fire for making love on, it meant he was
taking Ginny away, making her his. And if he admitted he wanted
something for himself it meant being selfish, because Harry Potter
wasn't allowed to have anything that was just for him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Which part of the
house lets you follow your dreams?" Ginny asked quietly as she laid
one hand on his chest. Harry's heart beat wildly in his chest at
the unexpected contact. He searched her eyes, seeing them without the
cloud of sorrow and doubt that had haunted them for the past few
weeks.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a
space," Harry whispered. "Under the stairs and it's just a
space and no one has to live there and there's no cupboard, just
space. And that space is as full of as much love as the rest of the
house and all the love in the house just fills it up until there's
no room for it and it spills out all the windows and all the doors."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny stood quietly
as a tear rolled down her cheek. Harry reached up and brushed it away
with his thumb.</p><p class="calibre8">"And it's
because you're there," Harry said quietly. Ginny looked up at him
solemnly. "When you're there … it's home." And then he said
the three words that obliterated the rest of the wall, smashing it to
dust. "I love you."</p><p class="calibre8">And Ginny kissed
him; really kissed him. Her arms snaked their way around his waist
and her body moulded to his. Harry could feel her fingers clutching
at his back and her thighs pressing against his own. He wound his
fingers into her hair and deepened the kiss fervently. It felt
amazing and exhilarating; like he could do just about anything. Ginny
was back in his arms and he didn't ever want to let her go.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was dimly
aware that they were in a room with his bed in it and there's no
telling where they might have ended up if Donald Smythe and Sebastian
Hornblower hadn't walked in.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd think all
his Christmasses had come at once!" Sebastian exclaimed as he
pushed the door open.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it is
nearly Christmas … poor kid deserves a break," Donald replied.
"Oh! Er, sorry Harry …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who deserves a
break?" Ginny asked, a smile on her face and her body still pressed
against Harry's. He was grateful that she hadn't moved. Harry had
no desire to advertise his arousal to anyone – apart from Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gilbert,"
answered Sebastian, looking a little self-conscious. Harry didn't
doubt he looked a bit flushed and was probably wearing a silly grin
but he felt too happy to care about the sensibilities of Sebastian
Hornblower. The general consensus was that Sebastian was wound so
tightly he could spontaneously combust at any moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"He got an Owl,"
Donald explained, throwing himself on Ron's bed. "I think it was
from his mum, a new house or something. I heard the other day they
had to move and he was really upset about it. I guess this house is
better than the other one." Harry smiled, wondering how Gerald had
taken the same news.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd better go,"
Ginny said softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"If you pack now,
we can be home in time for tea," Harry said. He pulled her towards
him and bent to press a soft kiss to her lips. Ginny wriggled against
him and giggled slightly before slipping form his grasp and out the
door. Harry shifted uncomfortably and turned to find Donald with a
wide grin on his face. Harry, his face flaming, concentrated on
packing for the weekend at the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Say, Harry,"
Sebastian began. He stopped when Harry looked up.</p><p class="calibre8">"What is it?"
Harry asked, aware that he rarely spoke to these two boys. Between
all his concerns and the fact that they were actually in Ginny's
year he didn't give them much thought.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you think
it's really over?" Sebastian asked, standing in the middle of the
room, twisting his hands together nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is what really
over?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like … are all
the Death Eaters really gone?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked up,
startled at the question. Everyone had seemed terribly careful not to
talk about the events of the past year, and Voldemort in particular,
since he'd taken Salbadar Limuson out with such force on the first
day of classes. Sebastian hurried on.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know
You-Know-Who is dead-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Voldemort,"
Harry interrupted harshly. Sebastian gulped. "Saying his name
doesn't do anything anymore."</p><p class="calibre8">"Um … yeah,"
Sebastian looked terribly uncomfortable but he took a deep breath and
kept going. "It's just last time he was gone my dad reckons all
his supporters weren't captured and they went and got new ones,
too." Sebastian shuffled nervously. "D'you think it's the
same? D'you think … are they still out there?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah …" Harry
nodded slowly. "Not necessarily Death Eaters exactly, but there's
probably always going to be Dark Wizards." Sebastian took a deep
breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"'Cause I think
Professor Thistlewaite is one," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
Thistlewaite is a Death Eater?" Harry asked blankly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
you told him your insane theory," Donald said, rolling his eyes.
"Sorry, Harry I tried to talk him out of it, but …" Donald
trailed off, shrugging.</p><p class="calibre8">"He feels Dark,"
Sebastian insisted, turning to Donald and glaring at him. "I'm
not insane."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
what you're seeing," Donald said. "If you ask me, Professor
Fiesche is more sinister than that nervous, twittery, old fool."</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor Fiesche
is an Auror!" Sebastian exclaimed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Still looks
Dark," Donald muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look, I'm sure
no one in the castle is a Dark Wizard," Harry said as he threw a
few more socks into his bag. "If you really have a concern about
someone you should speak to the Headmistress."</p><p class="calibre8">"But you're
Harry Potter," Sebastian said. Harry turned to look at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Bit more reliable
than some old woman," Donald explained with a grin. Harry was torn
between the novelty of being called reliable and need to tear strips
off them for the attitude towards Professor McGonagall.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's been
fighting Dark Wizards since before you were born," he said coldly
as he swung his bag over his shoulder. "Look, I know you mean well
but they are just new teachers. You'll get used to them." He
smiled at them, hoped he looked reassuring and strode out the door.
He was in a hurry to meet Ginny; if they hurried they could be at the
Burrow before tea.</p><p class="calibre8">*************</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell me again why
we didn't go straight home?" Ginny muttered as George searched
frantically through the pile of parchment on his desk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because we need
to go to the bank," Harry explained with a smirk.</p><p class="calibre8">"And going to the
<em class="calibre9">bank</em> involves coming to listen to George while he reads us
love notes?" Ginny asked incredulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Aha!" exclaimed
George, brandishing a piece of pink parchment. He bounded towards
them. "<em class="calibre9">This</em> is the one that finally got her to let me come
over!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably because
she wanted you to shut up …" George didn't hear her, he was too
busy straightening the pink parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is the rough
copy of course; she probably keeps her copy under her pillow,"
George said and cleared his throat. "<em class="calibre9">Upon my despair my heart
beats. I call for you, but you're gone. My heart and my eyes weep
until you come back to me. Only sorrow because you are gone. Eyes
like fire and hair like silk and all around is home."</em></p><p class="calibre8">"Promise me that
you will never write me poetry," Ginny said. Harry grinned at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" George
exclaimed suddenly, oblivious to his sister's grimace. "You've
got to help me, you're a bloke. We're going out tonight. The
other night she finally agreed to come for a drink – just one –
and we decided we were both so miserable, couldn't get any worse.
We had the best time. The whole time she liked me, just … it was
hard, y'know? I need to do my hair-"</p><p class="calibre8">"And you've
picked me for this?" Harry raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, clothes
then," George continued, waving a hand airily. "Where should we
go? Dinner? Dancing? What about one of those Muggle movings? That'd
be good, yeah?"</p><p class="calibre8">"George, as
flattered as I am," Harry said, "I really think you have had just
a little more experience with dating and things than me-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Should I take her
flowers?" George pressed.</p><p class="calibre8">"The bank,"
Harry said weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on, you want
me to ask Percy?" George asked. "Ron and Bill are still in Egypt
and Charlie's in Romania and …" The unsaid end of the sentence
hung heavily in the air.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm … just …"
Harry stopped frustrated not at all sure how to admit that he was
rubbish with romance in front of his girlfriend.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fine, I'll give
you tips then," George said, grinning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I can go to
the bank, no problem," said Ginny, with a sickly sweet smile,
holding out her hand. Harry glowered at her but fished his Gringotts
key out of his pocket, slapping it into her hand with a growl.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks Ginny,"
he said through gritted teeth. She kissed him on the cheek and ran
one hand down his chest, lingering on his waist and Harry shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Any particular
amount you'd like me to withdraw?" she asked, sliding the hand
around his back and down.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Harry said
quietly, sliding his arms around her. "Get whatever you need and a
few extra Galleons for treats at Hogsmeade next weekend."</p><p class="calibre8">"What I need?"
Ginny looked up at him, confusion on her face. Harry placed a gentle
kiss on her forehead.</p><p class="calibre8">"For Christmas
shopping," he said, "or, um … whatever."</p><p class="calibre8">"You want me to
buy you a Christmas present?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" Harry
shook his head fiercely. "I thought you'd want to buy things for
your family and there's more range here in London than in Hogsmeade
– oh we could get your dad something in Muggle London, so get some
converted to pounds, yeah?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But, I couldn't-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Couldn't what?"
Harry pulled her closer, daring her to say it, that she couldn't
use his money. It had been their vault for months now and she'd
never asked for a single thing, not spent a single Knut since they
bought school supplies and she'd shyly added a pair of winter
gloves and an array of hair clasps to the pile of new school robes
he'd insisted she buy.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny bit her bottom
lip and stared up at Harry. He could see the indecision on her face
and he wondered what exactly she was trying to decide.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay," Ginny
answered quietly, reaching up to press a kiss to his jaw. Harry
turned his head and captured her lips with his own.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good," he
breathed when he broke the kiss. His hands trailed up and down her
back. "I'll see you back here when you're done?" Ginny nodded
and reached up to kiss him again.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right, all
right!" George exclaimed. Harry jerked away guiltily and Ginny
laughed. George shook his head ruefully. "I'm your biggest fan,
Potter, but please cease playing hockey with her tonsils in the shop.
I had to turn poor Fred away. It's not right to subject that
display to someone who can't escape!" Harry glanced at the
plaster statue and the picture of Fred that always sat on the
counter. They faced the back wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"I won't be
long," Ginny said as she slipped out of Harry's grasp. Harry
watched her go and sighed heavily. His desire was back, stronger than
ever, and he couldn't help but wonder how he could get her alone
for more than five minutes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Need the use of
the upstairs bedroom, Harry?" George asked with a leer. Harry
jumped and whirled away from the window."</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" he cried.
"What for? What would we … us, erm, I … do up there?" George
laughed and Harry shifted uncomfortably.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, going all
right with Ginny then?" George leaned on the counter. Harry just
nodded. The uncomfortable silence settled over the shop and Harry
became intensely interested in the toe of his shoe. George picked up
a case of Skiving Snackboxes from the end of the counter and wandered
over to stack them on a shelf.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bit behind on the
stocking up with Ron gone," George said. Harry nodded and went over
to help. The two of them worked in silence for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen George,"
Harry said eventually. "Did you have something you wanted to talk
to me about?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," George
looked up from the display of Canary Creams that he was
straightening. "What makes you think that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Every time one of
you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"One of who?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill, Charlie,
Percy …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, the brothers
grim."</p><p class="calibre8">"Funny," Harry
said, not smiling. He took a deep breath. "Every time you get me
alone it's because you want to talk to me about not breaking
Ginny's heart. I just wondered what I did this time."</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah," George
said quietly. "I know I have had my moments but … I'm not
exactly opposed to you and Ginny, erm getting up to whatever it is
you two like to get up to."</p><p class="calibre8">"We, ah-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't finish
that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Right."</p><p class="calibre8">George fixed the
already straight Canary Creams and began adjusting a display of
shield hats. Harry eyed him carefully. Something wasn't right but
he had no idea what it was.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred was better
at picking outfits than me," George said eventually. Harry didn't
say anything, wondering if George would go on. It was the first time
Harry had heard George talk about Fred since his death without being
drunk, crying or shouting. George took a deep breath and picked up a
hat, twirling it idly.</p><p class="calibre8">"We used to double
date," George continued staring into space, eyes focused on
nothing, probably seeing the past. "Fred would pick what we would
wear. Nothing too much the same, but we matched, y'know? And he was
pants at shining shoes so I used to do that, but he was better at
doing hair. If I tried to do it myself that bit always used to stick
up above my ears." George stopped for a moment and fingered the
hair above his ear before he tugged slightly on the hair that covered
the hole where his missing ear was.</p><p class="calibre8">"Even with one ear
missing it still sticks up," George continued. "Like it doesn't
care that the ear's missing. Fred knew how to make it cover up the
missing ear though. He always used to fix that for me and I'd iron
our shirts the old fashioned way because we were both rubbish at
ironing charms.</p><p class="calibre8">"He always knew if
we should bring flowers and … Angelina likes daisies. He used to
bring her daisies. We stopped going on double dates with her. He used
to go by himself. But I'd still iron his shirt and he'd check my
hair for me before he left."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry didn't know
what to say. George put the hat down and wandered to the door and
flipped the sign on it to 'Closed.' Without warning George sank
down onto the floor, leaning against the door, drawing his knees up
to his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
how to be alone," he said. "When Ron's here it's … I can do
it. The days he's at Hogwarts are really, really hard. Percy was
here yesterday. He stayed nearly all day. I nearly cried when he left
and I locked up early and went home. I think Mum thought I was
nutters when I started chopping vegetables for her. She sent me out
to get the eggs and … I made Fleur go with me. Harry, I think I'm
going nuts."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sank down onto
the floor next to George. They sat in silence for a moment before
Harry spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
going to wear tonight?" he asked. "If you're going to take
daisies, you don't want anything … white, I guess." George
turned to look at him and it was then Harry noticed the tears filling
George's eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny's pretty
good with hair," Harry added quietly. George nodded silently and
let the tears fall and Harry put an arm around his shoulders and held
him while he cried.</p><p class="calibre8">They were still
sitting like that when Ginny came back. Harry jumped up to open the
door for her and George grinned at her a bit sadly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Need to go buy
some flowers," he explained as he shoved his hands in his pockets
and slipped out the door. "Be back in a bit." Harry closed the
door after him, watching as he walked down the street, head bowed and
shoulders hunched against the cold.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is he all right?"
Ginny asked softly. Harry turned around and shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Misses Fred,"
he said. Ginny turned to watch George disappear between two witches
at the far end of the Alley. Harry slid an arm around her shoulders.
"He's getting there but Ron being away ... he's lonely."
Ginny laid her head on Harry's chest and sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked down at
her. She was clutching a brown paper wrapped package. The paper was
wrinkled and brittle looking and the string it was tied with still
had dust clinging to it. The package was partially hidden by her
cloak and it was torn on one corner, a thick piece of yellowing
parchment poked out.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's that?"
Harry asked nodding at the package. Ginny started almost guiltily and
glanced at it quickly before looking up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I got, um, some
Galleons and then I exchanged some for pounds, but I don't know if
it was a good rate," she answered. Harry raised an eyebrow at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"That package is
not full of pounds."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … no,"
Ginny admitted. "I'm not exactly sure what's in the package,
precisely."</p><p class="calibre8">"Where did you get
it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Your vault,"
she answered, looking at the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not that I mind,"
Harry said, reaching out to tilt her chin up so that she was looking
at him, "but why would you bring a tatty looking package out of <em class="calibre9">our</em>
vault?" He could tell that she didn't miss his emphasis. For an
answer she slowly pulled the package out from under her cloak and
turned it over. Scrawled across it were the words <em class="calibre9">Engagement,
Christmas 1977</em>. Harry stared.</p><p class="calibre8">"I found it at the
back of the vault," Ginny said. "If you go sort of past the piles
of Galleons there's um, there's like a chest and some books and
things back there." Harry took the package and turned it over in
his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's been there
all this time?" he asked incredulously. Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … there's a
lot of things in the chest," she said. "I just brought that
because I thought maybe there would be a wizarding picture of it.
Like the one by your bed. I got distracted when I saw George; I meant
to tell you straight away."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry strode to the
counter of the shop, laying the package down and pulling at the
string that bound it together. He peeled back the paper to reveal a
piece of brightly coloured Christmas wrapping paper, several moving
photographs and a squashed green bow. He reached out and picked up a
picture of his parents, dressed the same as the engagement photograph
from Dudley, the ring shining on his mother's hand as she waved it
at the camera. His dad stood next to her proudly, one arm around her
shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">Passing the moving
wizarding photograph to Ginny, Harry pulled the next photograph from
the package. Tears stung his eyes as he looked at a crooked picture
of his dad, his arm around a frail, white haired woman. They were
standing with a man, who despite his advanced age, looked just like
James Potter. A Christmas tree stood in the background and Harry's
father was laughing merrily while waving and winking at the person
taking the photograph. Ginny moved towards him and, seeing the
photograph, she tucked herself against his side and wrapped an arm
around his waist. Harry pulled her close, the photograph shaking in
his other hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
grandparents," Ginny said softly. "There're some other things
…"</p><p class="calibre8">"Where did it come
from?" Harry asked. "How did it get there?" Ginny shrugged and
the two of them stood gazing at the photograph until they heard
George's keys jangling at the door.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry hastily
shuffled the paper, bow and photographs together and wrapped them
back in the paper before carefully slipping the package into his bag.
Ginny eyed him momentarily but didn't say anything. Harry didn't
feel like sharing it with George just then. He wasn't sure why. It
might have been because he didn't want George seeing the photos but
it could have been because George looked absolutely terrified as he
stood in the middle of the shop, clutching a bunch of daises that he
was squeezing so hard his knuckles were white.</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope you are
planning on getting changed," Ginny told him lightly. "Because
those daisies clash with the swirls on your robes."</p><p class="calibre8">"They do?"
George asked, looking down at himself. Ginny nodded emphatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Absolutely,"
she said. "Now, are we getting ready for this date upstairs or …?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm, flat's a
bit of a mess …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Needs cleaning up
then," Ginny said, skipping to the door that led to the upstairs
flat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Haven't spent a
lot of time there," George said. "It's empty." Ginny turned
around.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," she
said quietly. A glint of mischief flickered across her face. "Are
you going to raid his wardrobe or will I?" George threw back his
head and laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry followed the
two of them upstairs. Within an hour Harry and Ginny had aired out
the flat, cleaned the mess and debris in the living room and kitchen
and scrubbed the bathroom. George was dressed in a purple shirt from
Fred's wardrobe that Harry had ironed with an ancient iron Arthur
had charmed when the twins had moved out of the Burrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're a bit
domestic, Potter," George had smirked at him while he sat patiently
as Ginny did his hair and Harry ironed his shirt. "Ginny said my
shiny new bathroom is your doing." He raised an eyebrow at Harry
who shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"And here I
thought you were all typical and messy like all the other boys,"
Ginny teased Harry as she handed George a mirror.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've not seen
the Muggles' house, dear Gin-Gin," George said, admiring his hair
in the mirror. "Dreadfully sanitary, it was. Couldn't be a boy
growing up there without learning a bit of domesticity. Of course
that pig of a cousin of yours looked like he didn't know one end of
a broom from the other. Still, I bet they never let him near a
broomstick." George chuckled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
Dudley's picked up a broom in his life," he said, shaking his
head wryly. "When I came back from Hogwarts after first year Uncle
Vernon looked at me funny every time I swept the kitchen after
breakfast. I reckon he thought I was about to jump on it and fly
away."</p><p class="calibre8">"Still … awfully
clean, this bathroom," George said. Harry shifted uncomfortably. "I
reckon you did more than your fair share of cleaning there." Harry
didn't say anything. Ginny began to straighten the cushions on
George's couch and didn't look at Harry. George watched Harry so
closely he felt he was under a microscope.</p><p class="calibre8">Thankfully George
let the subject drop, turning back to his uncharacteristic fretting
over Angelina.</p><p class="calibre8">***********</p><p class="calibre8">Molly kept watching
Harry. He squirmed uncomfortably. She'd been doing it all evening.
When he and Ginny had arrived at the Burrow Molly had descended on
her only daughter, fussing over Ginny and enveloping her in a hug.
Harry had smiled at Molly's questioning glance, hoping he looked
cheerful enough to reassure her. The packet of photographs and
mementos was weighing on his mind and it made him a little
distracted.</p><p class="calibre8">After tea they went
into the sitting room. Fleur excused herself to go and write to Bill
but Arthur dozed in a chair with the evening paper. Molly's
knitting needles click-clacked constantly as she listened to her
daughter talk about Hogwarts. Ginny was sitting so close to Harry on
the couch that she was almost sitting in his lap. Harry amused
himself by playing with Ginny's hair, watching the strands fall
through his fingers.</p><p class="calibre8">"And your Defence
classes are going well?" Molly asked during a lull in Ginny's
chatter. Harry looked up as Ginny launched into a description of a
duel Harry and Hermione had staged for the class that week where
Hermione had almost won.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry smiled at
Ginny and picked up the tiny hand that was resting on his thigh. He
brought it to his lips, pressing a kiss to her palm. He smiled as he
felt her fingers curl into his cheek. Harry noticed Molly gazing at
him as he entwined his fingers with Ginny's and turned her hand
over to brush a soft kiss across her knuckles. Molly smiled softly as
she nodded at Ginny's description of Neville looking surprised that
he'd actually stunned Dean.</p><p class="calibre8">"I mean, even
after last year he gets caught off guard sometimes," Ginny said,
shaking her head. "He's the best at dodging spells and his aim's
pretty good now, too."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah but Dean's
not a slouch himself," Harry interjected. "Being on the run is
the perfect way to practice dodging." Harry wished he hadn't
spoken when Molly looked at him sadly. He squirmed in his seat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I wish you
children weren't still thinking about dodging and defending,"
Molly said with a sniff. "It should be over."</p><p class="calibre8">"We're not
children anymore," Ginny muttered. Molly sighed and nodded as
though acknowledging the truth of the statement. Ginny continued.
"Dean got caught anyway, didn't he? Doesn't seem like very good
dodging to me!"</p><p class="calibre8">"We got caught by
the same blokes," Harry said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was probably
Ron's fault," Ginny grumbled mutinously. Her mother raised an
eyebrow at Ginny's belligerent tone and Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was mine,
actually," he admitted. "You can't keep blaming Ron for
everything."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yours?" Ginny
asked sharply at the same time her mother asked what else she was
blaming on Ron. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did you end
up captured?" Arthur asked suddenly. Harry was startled. He'd
thought the older man was asleep but he'd obviously been aware
enough to follow the conversation. Harry shifted uncomfortably, not
used to direct questions about his activities last year. Until now
the Weasleys had left the subject alone, taking what he said and not
demanding anything else. He saw now the question in their eyes and
realised they still knew precious little of what their youngest son
had been up to in the previous year and he knew it must be hard for
them not to know.</p><p class="calibre8">He imagined that if
one of his children ran off with his best mate, whose face was on a
wanted poster, for a whole year – then he'd have questions, too.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron hasn't
said?" Harry asked, stalling for time.</p><p class="calibre8">"He refuses to
talk about it," Molly answered quietly. Harry stared into the
crackling fire for a moment, wondering where to start. He could give
the short version, he thought. He'd said 'Voldemort' and that
was it, really, but he felt the weight of the packet of Christmas
engagement photos still in the pocket of his robes. It was coming up
to Christmas again and he had a strange and almost uncanny urge to
unburden himself about the events of last Christmas. They had nothing
to do with getting captured, not really; and Harry floundered in a
sea of memories, not knowing what to say, only that he wanted to say
something. Ginny squeezed his hand gently and he turned to look at
her. She smiled at him and Harry knew it would be okay if he didn't
say anything but that she wanted to know as well.</p><p class="calibre8">"He warned me,"
Harry blurted. "He knew that Voldemort had jinxed his own name but
I said it anyway. I was too caught up in making my point."</p><p class="calibre8">"You never were
afraid to say it like the rest of us," Arthur said gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did he know
not to say it?" Molly asked. "We didn't hear from you, any of
you. If we had …" Harry sighed. Admitting that Ron had been at
Bill's over Christmas last year was probably going to get both Ron
and Bill in trouble.</p><p class="calibre8">"We had a fight,"
he said. "The ah, the locket Horcrux was making us a little …
well, we overheard Dean and Ted Tonks talking to some goblins about,
um … Hogwarts and Hermione and I started thinking about how the
sword could maybe destroy the locket; but I think Ron was sort of
angry because I was concentrating on the sword, he thought I didn't
care that, um …" Harry stopped and glanced at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Was this after we
tried to steal the sword out of Snape's office?" she asked him.
Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"We had a massive
fight," Harry admitted. "He thought I didn't care that you were
facing certain death in the Forbidden Forest as penance for your
sword-stealing sins." Ginny snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"It really was
very foolish of you, dear," Molly said primly, her knitting needles
moving furiously. "That forest isn't exactly safe. I don't know
what Hagrid was thinking taking you on a detention in there."</p><p class="calibre8">"It was safer than
the other detention options," Ginny said quietly. Molly blanched
but kept knitting, her fingers a little shakier.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's what I
said," Harry grumbled. "I don't know … it just degenerated
into a fight. He said I didn't care that his family could be dead.
And then I said he should go home to Mummy's cooking and he said it
was all right for me cos my parents were … well …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron <em class="calibre9">said</em>
that?" Ginny gaped at him. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">I</em> told him
to leave," he said quietly. "He would have stayed if I hadn't
yelled at him to go."</p><p class="calibre8">"I would have
yelled at him to go, too," Ginny said through gritted teeth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where did he go?"
Arthur asked. He was sitting up straight now, the paper lay in his
lap, forgotten.</p><p class="calibre8">"He certainly
didn't come here," Mrs Weasley sniffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought he'd
go to Hogwarts," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"He never turned
up there," Ginny said. "I would have hexed him if he had."</p><p class="calibre8">"The Snatchers got
him," Harry admitted, Molly gasped. "He escaped, though, and
tried to get back but Hermione and I moved and concealed ourselves
again and he couldn't find us, so he went to Bill's."</p><p class="calibre8">"You and Hermione
were alone in the tent?" Molly raised an eyebrow and Ginny
snickered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm ... well …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Molly," Arthur
said quietly, "I hardly think that's the point." Molly's
knitting needles began to move faster, her fingers flying furiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"She spent the
whole time crying about Ron," Harry said, feeling uncomfortably
hot. He knew his face was flaming. "I don't blame him. Not
really. I had no idea what I was doing. He was right to question me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill never told
us Ron was there," Arthur said. Molly grunted. Harry didn't know
if she was unhappy with him and Hermione or Bill and Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"When did he come
back?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"After Christmas
he found us again," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"After Christmas?"
Ginny stared incredulously. "It was that long?" Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"He saved my
life."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why didn't he
come home?" Arthur asked. Molly's knitting needles were shaky and
she stopped knitting suddenly, looking up at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, why?" she
asked softly. Harry couldn't bear the sorrow in her gaze and he
turned to look into the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"He thought you'd
be angry with him for walking out on us," he said. "He was
particularly afraid of the twins' wrath and what Ginny might do to
him."</p><p class="calibre8">"He was right to
be afraid," Ginny said furiously. "If he had turned up here at
Christmas, I would've – oooh and he sent<em class="calibre9"> me</em> a Howler for
not talking to you? That hypocrite!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron sent you a
Howler?" Molly raised her eyebrow at her daughter and Harry saw
Arthur attempt to mask a smirk. Ginny just growled.</p><p class="calibre8">"So when he found
us again he warned us about not saying Voldemort, but …" Harry
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"How long did
Hermione refuse to talk to him?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only about a
day." Harry grinned at her. Ginny grinned back. Molly's needles
began to click-clack again and Arthur's paper rustled as he picked
it up, folding it carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"What made you say
Voldemort?" Ginny asked after a moment. "To get you captured?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We were listening
to <em class="calibre9">Potterwatch</em>," Harry said absently, "and Fred was
talking … we thought it might have been George but Ron said it was
Fred …" Harry stopped as his throat closed over. He struggled to
swallow and took a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred was Rapier,"
Ginny said quietly. "He was joking about Basilisks."</p><p class="calibre8">"How did you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill came to move
us to Auntie Muriel's," Ginny cut in, "because they knew Ron
was with you. George and I were listening to the wireless and then …
I felt like something bad had happened but I didn't know what. We
…. me and George, stayed up all night waiting for Fred to come
home. He had trouble on his way back from broadcasting, had to hide
for a while. Reckoned he was spotted but he couldn't figure out
what they wanted."</p><p class="calibre8">"He didn't tell
me that!" Molly exclaimed, the knitting needles stopping briefly
before resuming their steady click-clack.</p><p class="calibre8">"There wasn't a
lot of time," Ginny said, drawing her knees up to her chest. "And
things got crazy that day. Remember Bill showed up? You made us all
leave but you wouldn't tell me why. Fred only just got home in
time. Bill and George were arguing because George wouldn't leave
without Fred. Bill told him he'd stay for Fred and that George had
to get me out. That was the only thing that got George moving. When I
realised George wasn't waiting for Fred – but only because of me
… I made Bill tell me … I made him tell me what had happened."</p><p class="calibre8">"I wondered what
made you ask why we couldn't go and stay with Bill," Arthur said,
sounding incredibly amused. Ginny blushed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"One Fidelius
would have been a lot easier to set up," Ginny answered.</p><p class="calibre8">"There wouldn't
have been room," Harry muttered. Ginny patted his thigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," she
said, "and it also would have been very distracting." Harry
leaned down and pressed a kiss to her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," he
breathed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
Ron ditched you guys," Ginny muttered. "He-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't blame Ron
for everything," Harry said quietly. "He's my best mate and
sometimes … it's my fault."</p><p class="calibre8">"All right then,"
Ginny sighed. "Can I at least get him back for the Howler?" Harry
laughed then.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only if I can
help."</p><p class="calibre8">************</p><p class="calibre8">It was late and
Molly and Arthur had gone up to bed. Harry and Ginny sat together in
the living room. Harry was idly playing with the hem of Ginny's
shirt while she flicked through the evening paper her father had left
when he'd gone up to bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"It says here that
they've chosen a sculptor for the new statue in the Ministry,"
Ginny said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hmmmm," Harry
answered, leaning forward to nuzzle her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wonder what it
will be, oh…" Ginny trailed off as Harry began to place feather
light kisses along her collarbone, through her shirt.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll find
out," Harry murmured. "As long as it's not of me, I don't
care." Ginny giggled and shifted a bit so that Harry could slip his
hands underneath her shirt.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny soon abandoned
the paper in favour of kissing Harry and it was several minutes
before she pulled away, her hands still running through his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"We should go up
to bed," he said. "It's late."</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay," Ginny
said, grinning. "Yours or mine?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Separate beds,"
Harry said firmly. Ginny pouted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Party pooper."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not … I
can't … your father trusts me!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ginny
said gently. "I'm only kidding. But if you want to …"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Harry
shook his head. "I just … your parents ..."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay,"
Ginny insisted, her fingers trailing down the front of his shirt. She
leaned forward and kissed him and Harry gave himself up to the
feelings until Ginny pulled away. "Mum's probably listening for
when we go to bed."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry nodded
wordlessly and stood up, extending a hand to her as he did so. They
stopped outside Ginny's bedroom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodnight,"
Ginny said.</p><p class="calibre8">"See you in the
morning," Harry whispered. He kissed Ginny softly, his hands
trailing along her sides and over her hips. He squeezed her hand one
last time before he turned to go up the stairs to Ron's room.</p><p class="calibre8">Once inside he
pulled the packet of photos out of his pocket and sat on the cramped
bed that had been left permanently in Ron's room for him. He shed
his robes, shrugging them onto the floor and toed off his trainers
before pulling his feet up onto the bed and untying the packet again.
The photographs spilled out and the wrapping paper fluttered to the
floor. As Harry picked it up he noticed a gift tag still attached
with a yellowing piece of spellotape that was only still there by
magic. He carefully turned the tag over so that he could read the
scrawl on it.</p><p class="calibre7">'<em class="calibre9">To
Lily, all my love, James'</em></p><p class="calibre8">Harry smiled. The
square of paper wasn't very big but it had been folded
meticulously. Harry held it and the gift tag in his hands for a
moment before putting it down, laying the squashed gift bow on the
top and turning his attention again to the photographs. The photos of
his smiling grandparents and his radiant parents were taken on the
same day as the Muggle photograph he'd found in the envelope from
Dudley. They were wearing the same clothes and displaying the same
ring proudly. The fairy lights on the Christmas tree fluttered from
branch to branch and the dark, rich background looked similar to the
furnishings at Grimmauld Place. Harry wondered if his father had
grown up in a similar style of house.</p><p class="calibre8">He reached out
silently to trace the features of his grandfather. The old man had
bright, twinkling eyes that reminded him of Dumbledore and thinning
hair that was obviously white with age. The affection that shone
through to his wife and son was obvious and Harry felt his eyes grow
wet. He smiled as he let the tears fall. The people in the photos
were gone but he held, in his hands, some echo of his wizarding
heritage and now that he finally had it, the emotions overwhelmed
him. Ginny had said there were more things in his vault and he
wondered why he'd not investigated it before.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry propped the
photo of his father and grandparents on his bedside table and
undressed for bed. If he was honest with himself he hadn't checked
the vault partly because he didn't have time but mostly because his
past had been something he'd been told never to ask. First rule of
living with the Dursleys – 'Don't ask questions'. It was as
if something inside of him was slowly melting and he started to
wonder for the first time what his family was like and what other
treasures he could uncover at the back of the vault. As he doused the
lamp and burrowed under the covers he realised that for the first
time he was curious, perhaps even excited to find out what lay in his
past.</p><p class="calibre8">The thought must
have kept him awake because he was still laying, staring at the
ceiling and wondering if he'd been a fool to pass up the
opportunity to have Ginny Weasley in his bed when the door creaked
open. Harry propped himself up on one elbow to see Ginny, bathed in
moonlight, pushing the door closed behind her.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
doing?" he whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Visiting,"
Ginny replied as she padded softly over to his bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Budge over,"
Ginny hissed as she reached for the covers. Harry clutched them to
his chest</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Harry
yelped. She was dressed in nothing more than one of Ron's old
Cannons T Shirts and Harry was acutely aware of his own state of
undress. Ginny just rolled her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've seen it
all before," she grinned and bent down to yank the covers away and
climbed in beside Harry. She smirked as Harry's eyes travelled down
to the spot where the T Shirt had ridden up on her thighs. "And so
have you."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry pulled the
covers up around their shoulders and Ginny snuggled closer to him,
laying her head on the pillow and reaching an arm out to snake around
his waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not that I'm
not happy to see you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I can tell,"
Ginny murmured.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny!" She ran
her hand up and down his back slowly and Harry found his arms around
her and his lips on hers before he had a conscious thought. It was
with extreme self control that he pulled away, because Ginny was
pressed against him in all the right places and he was sure she was
trying to torture him or kill him … or both.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," Ginny
murmured, not deterred by his actions she merely began kissing along
his jaw and down his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop that,"
Harry hissed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" Ginny
asked as she trailed kisses across his shoulder. "You've been
desperate all day."</p><p class="calibre8">"Desperate's a
strong word …"</p><p class="calibre8">"You tried to feel
me up in George's bathroom with a cleaning rag in the other hand!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You shouldn't
lean over like that …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I do it on
purpose …" Ginny giggled and ran a hand down and over the curve
of his hip and Harry sucked in a breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," he
growled. With a massive amount of self control he still his own hands
which had been tracing patterns on her back through the T Shirt and
took a deep, shuddering breath. "You need to go back to bed."</p><p class="calibre8">"I am in bed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not my bed, your
bed!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" In the
moonlight that streamed through Ron's tiny window Harry could see
her big, brown eyes looking up at him, the pupils wide. He struggled
to find a reason. Taking a deep breath he stared short-sightedly at
the picture propped up on his nightstand. He couldn't see the
people in the image but he knew his father stood proudly with his
parents in front of an impressive Christmas tree, the three of them
smiling and happy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your parents,"
Harry answered eventually, "are right down stairs. It's not …
it's well … your dad …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Understands,"
Ginny said, beginning a fresh trail of kisses along his jaw line.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, he'd be
very understanding if he came up here to investigate the odd sounds
the ghoul was making," Harry hissed, "and found us in bed … and
the ghoul not making the noises!" Ginny giggled and Harry groaned
as the laughter shook her whole body which was still in contact with
his own.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you saying,
Mr Potter, that I'm noisy in bed?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dunno," Harry
shot back, "Never had you in a bed before!" Ginny laughed then, a
full belly laugh that seemed to bubble out of her throat and float
out across the silent room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhhhhhh!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum and dad can't
hear us," Ginny whispered as she tried to control her laughter.
"They're a couple flights down and Dad's snoring is legendary.
I don't know how Mum sleeps through it. Neither of them are going
to hear anything. You could make me scream your name and they
wouldn't even know it."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're killing
me," Harry groaned at the images Ginny was putting in his head.
"This is your parents' house!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh stop!" Ginny
said, her voice muffled as she travelled down his chest, laying a
trail of kisses in her wake. She giggled again. "They have sex in
the house all the time."</p><p class="calibre8">This did not
reassure Harry. He was not at all certain that they would be so
amenable to <em class="calibre9">him</em> having sex in their house. With their
daughter. While they were there.</p><p class="calibre8">He wasn't sure<em class="calibre9">
he</em> was amenable to it. But Ginny's lips did make a persuasive
argument … and his body seemed to have ideas very different from
his head. He could tell Ginny was smiling as he pressed against her
and pulled her lips up to his for a searing kiss that he could feel
all the way to his toes. He'd been a fool to even think he could
let her back out of his bed once she'd climbed in.</p><p class="calibre8">*************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry cracked his
eyes open when he heard the door creak. He froze. He could still feel
Ginny's warmth pressed against his side, her leg thrown over his
and her breathing ghosting softly across his chest. Dawn was breaking
and a weak light filtered in through the window. There was no hiding
the red tresses strewn across his pillow and the discarded clothing
on the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" an
urgent voice hissed. "Are you awake?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
answered back in a voice that cracked alarmingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I need to talk to
you!" It was George.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">This was good
news</em>, Harry thought as he grabbed for his glasses. George offered
the brightest hope for mercy. Ginny stirred as Harry found his
glasses and shoved them on his face awkwardly with one hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't wake her
up," George hissed. Harry glared at George, expecting to find him
smirking at him or perhaps taking aim.</p><p class="calibre8">But George was
looking anxious and pale, shifting rapidly from one foot to the other
in the doorway. Harry slowly untangled his limbs from Ginny's and
soothed her back to sleep with a kiss, stroking her hair the way he
did to Teddy. He blushed a little as he climbed out of the bed and
unearthed his boxers from beneath Ginny's T Shirt, pulling them on
hastily. He and George had once shared a locker room, but Harry had
never entered the locker room after being pressed against a naked
girl. The evidence was damning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on,"
George muttered urgently, grabbing Harry's arm and hauling him down
the stairs. He stumbled on the second floor landing and banged into
the wall. George shushed him hurriedly and kept dragging him. Harry
winced as his left foot connected with the banister and his right
shoulder was wrenched as George rounded the corner, making for the
sitting room.</p><p class="calibre8">Perhaps torture
wasn't far from George's mind at all.</p><p class="calibre8">"Next time could
you let me get a robe or dressing gown or … even a shirt?" Harry
grumbled, rubbing his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry," George
said, not sounding at all penitent. He grinned at Harry for a brief
moment. "You should wear pyjamas." Harry crossed his arms over
his chest and glared.</p><p class="calibre8">"What was so
urgent you had to drag me out of bed at …" He squinted at the
timepiece on the mantelpiece, "seven o'clock in the morning on a
weekend?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nice, warm bed
was it, Potter?" George was smirking and Harry didn't answer him.
The smirk lasted only seconds before George began pacing and a
worried frown graced his features. He spun to face Harry suddenly.
"You know the contraception charm, right?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry nodded slowly.
George gripped Harry's upper arms, his fingers digging in
painfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Always, always
<em class="calibre9">use it</em>," George said. He looked pale and anxious in the
pale, dawn light.</p><p class="calibre8">"George," Harry
said. "You probably should have told me that … earlier." George
released him and smacked the back of Harry's head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't get smart
or I'll conveniently remember who I saw in your bed just now,"
George smirked evilly. "And I'll tell Ron you did it in his
room."</p><p class="calibre8">"How was your
date?" Harry asked, casting wildly about for a change of subject.
"And d'you think I could borrow your cloak? I'm freezing here."
George unbuttoned his cloak and threw it at Harry before pacing the
length of the living room. He leaned on the windowsill, his head
against the pane. Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and
clutched it together at the front. George looked as though he had the
weight of the world on his shoulders. He stepped forward tentatively.</p><p class="calibre8">"George?" he
asked. "What's wrong?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She wanted to see
me," George said quietly turning around. "Angelina had some news
for me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Was it good
news?" Harry studied George's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think so,"
George said slowly. "But I don't know what to do."</p><p class="calibre8">"Can I help?"
Harry asked quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I – I …"
George sighed. He looked up. "She's pregnant."</p>
