<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_35">*Chapter 34*: Chapter 34</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
34. Monster</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Bowing to the
insistence of Ginny, a group of second years and Ron, Harry put up
the Quidditch tryout notice the day after the victory at the
Wizengamot. A crowd of students were gathered around it before
breakfast had even started.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why aren't they
all still asleep?" grumbled Seamus blearily from an armchair near
the fireplace in the common room. "Don't they know it's
Sunday?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, what are
you doing up then, you great lump?" asked Dean as he lowered
himself onto one of the couches.</p><p class="calibre8">"Same thing you
are, ain't I?" Seamus retorted. "Pursuit of women."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh really?"
Neville asked, wandering up to the small group by the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"Takin' Luna to
breakfast then Neville?" Seamus asked. "Might just come along,
won't be in the way or nothing." Seamus jumped up and trailed
after Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's still
chasing that Audrey bird," Dean sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pursuit of
women?" inquired Harry with a raised eyebrow. Dean just shrugged
and unfolded himself from the couch before heading out the portrait
hole. Harry stared into the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">He jumped when warm
hands encircled him from behind and soft lips pressed a kiss to his
neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good morning,"
Ginny whispered. Harry turned his head and smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Morning."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione will be
down shortly," Ginny said cheerfully, standing up straight. "She
just needs a moment to get her bearings." Harry eyed her
suspiciously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you give her
some hangover potion?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, Harry,"
said Ginny slowly, thoughtfully, "that's the curious thing. I
cannot seem to find any." At that moment Harry heard a shuffling on
the stairs and a very pale Hermione Granger entered the common room
moments later.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good morning,
Hermione!" sang Ginny cheerfully. Hermione winced. "Ready for
breakfast? I hope they have lots of bacon and eggs with toast and
lashings of butter!" Hermione turned a delicate shade of green and
lowered herself gingerly into a chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"You all right,
Hermione?" Harry asked. "Not going to throw up on me again are
you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Again?" asked
Hermione and groaned. "I threw up on you already?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well only once
actually <em class="calibre9">on</em> me," clarified Harry. "But um … twice,
yeah."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I'm so
sorry." Hermione closed her eyes and leaned back in the chair. "Why
is the world still spinning?"</p><p class="calibre8">"So, you and Ron
got up to some mischief last night then?" asked Ginny, leaning on
the back of the couch. Harry suddenly had a very good view down her
top. His eyes flicked up to her face and by her smirk, he knew she
was doing it on purpose.</p><p class="calibre8">"We were just
celebrating my birthday," Hermione muttered. "I think, perhaps
too many people wanted to buy us drinks."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, the price of
fame." Harry nodded sagely and Ginny burst into giggles. Hermione
held her head and moaned.</p><p class="calibre8">****************</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione needed no
encouragement to help Ginny with her studies. In Harry's experience
this had always meant filling every available minute with a book in
your hand. Ginny was no exception. It left few chances for him to be
alone with her. They had been caught kissing once by Professor
Flitwick in an empty classroom and by Hagrid down by the lake but for
the most part they never had more than a few stolen moments before
Hermione would whisk Ginny off somewhere to study. For some reason
they just never seemed to have enough <em class="calibre9">time</em>. Harry was starting
to feel like he would <em class="calibre9">never</em> have enough time with her because
every time he tried to say more than a few words it would be time for
a class or someone needed to see him or Ginny went to catch up on her
studies. The one time they had ventured up to the Astronomy Tower,
giggling under the Invisibility Cloak, they had seen rather more of
Draco Malfoy and his girlfriend than they ever cared to.</p><p class="calibre8">The next Saturday
dawned a bit overcast and gloomy for the Quidditch tryouts and Ron
arrived in the Gryffindor common room fireplace before breakfast. He
startled Harry who was hurriedly scratching out part of a
Transfiguration essay, hoping to get it finished before they began
the trials which looked likely to last most of the morning. Harry was
hoping that with Hermione occupied by Ron he would be able to have
Ginny to himself for more than three minutes that afternoon.</p><p class="calibre8">"Morning, Harry!"
greeted Ron. "You're looking very studious."</p><p class="calibre8">"Comes with being
a student," Harry grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione said its
Quidditch trials this morning," Ron said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen mate,"
began Harry hesitantly, "I know you came to spend time with
Hermione, but d'you think you could … we need a Keeper …" He
trailed off. Ron beamed at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm there!"
exclaimed Ron exuberantly. "I'll find you the best Keeper you can
get out of all the little scrawny midgets!"</p><p class="calibre8">With Hermione
sufficiently distracted by Ron, Harry managed to steal Ginny away
before they went down to breakfast. She all but pinned him to the
wall in a little alcove just off the sixth floor corridor and Harry
wondered idly if they had enough room or time for something a little
more adventurous. Ginny certainly seemed willing, he mused, as she
ran her hands up under his shirt with very little preamble. This was
probably even a less desirable place than the Quidditch changing
room, however, and he pulled away from her insistent hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's skip
breakfast," Ginny said breathlessly. Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
so, we have to get ready for Quidditch tryouts," he murmured. Ginny
shrugged delicately.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it would
really … help." She looked up at him and smiled. Harry debated in
his mind. For the first time in a week they were alone, together;
Hermione was not going to suddenly turn up and they had nowhere to be
until ten o'clock.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well …"
Harry's voice cracked a little and Ginny grinned victoriously.</p><p class="calibre8">"There should be
plenty of empty rooms around here … in a castle this big," she
said, winding her arms around his waist.</p><p class="calibre8">Later, Harry
wondered if he would have given in to her but at that moment a very
loud croak sounded near their feet and Ginny jumped. Harry felt, but
did not see something land on his foot and heard the sound of
shuffling footsteps, thumping doors and raised voices getting closer.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is that … I
think its Trevor," Ginny whispered as she pulled out her wand.
"<em class="calibre9">Lumos</em>." Two gleaming eyes blinked up at them and the
toad croaked again. The thumping and shouting got louder. Harry could
hear people calling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Trevor!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Bart!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm telling
you, get a bigger cage!" Othello sounded distinctly irritated.
Harry peered out into the corridor and saw Neville and Luna with
Dexter and his friends. He pulled back into the alcove and pressed
himself and Ginny against the back wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe they won't
see us," he whispered as he nudged at Trevor with his foot.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sick of
looking for your stupid toad. I told you to get an owl," Hamish
grumbled as the group got closer. Trevor hopped back into the alcove
with Harry and Ginny and climbed onto Harry's foot.</p><p class="calibre8">"Get off you slimy
little amphibian," Harry hissed. Ginny shivered and pressed herself
closer to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"That toad keeps
giving me the creeps," she said in a hushed whisper. "Look, he's
<em class="calibre9">staring</em>. <em class="calibre9">Nox</em>." She cancelled the spell and they were
plunged into the shadows.</p><p class="calibre8">"I do not think
you should try to separate Trevor and Bart," Luna's voice floated
through the corridor. "It is clear they wish to be together."</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna! Trevor's
not like that!"</p><p class="calibre8">"He is a toad, not
a monk, Neville. He has needs."</p><p class="calibre8">"But … Bart's
a …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I do not think
Bart is a boy."</p><p class="calibre8">"The man in the
shop said he was!" Dexter protested loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Men do not know
everything," said Luna as she sailed into the alcove where Harry
and Ginny were still clutching each other, Trevor blinking innocently
on Harry's foot. "Hello Harry, hello Ginny. I am sorry; Bart
appears to have interrupted your attempts to join together." Harry
could feel Ginny heat up as she blushed and his jaw dropped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna! There are
first years here!" Neville looked utterly mortified and refused to
look at Harry and Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, you may
wish to re-button Ginevra's shirt," Luna commented serenely as
she bent swiftly to pick up the toad. Harry flushed as Ginny spun
quickly to face the wall and button her shirt, her face flaming. Luna
held the fat toad in her hands out to Dexter.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's not
Bart," sighed Dexter. "That's Trevor; we still don't know
where Bart is."</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll keep
looking," Neville reassured him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Will you help us
find Bart, Mr – H-Harry?" Gilbert asked timidly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure," Harry
answered swiftly, desperate to divert attention from the fact that he
and Ginny had been in the alcove at all. "We're, um, checking out
this corridor are we?" Dexter nodded enthusiastically.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Ginny
joined the others searching for the toad, looking behind tapestries,
under suits of armour and inside decorative urns. Neville, clutching
Trevor, pulled Harry aside.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen, really
sorry about that," he said. "I didn't expect to find anyone
there, not since Partington from Ravenclaw set up that system on the
third floor." Harry stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um … what?"
he asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know,"
Neville waved his hands carelessly, "There's a bunch of rooms
there, empty, so Partington – brilliant at Transfiguration, that
kid – sets up a room for you … if you … you know … want some
time."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione found it
last night," Ginny interrupted, pulling her head out of an urn.
"She made him dismantle it and Partington's got detention for
about a month." Neville cursed.</p><p class="calibre8">"The first years,
Neville," Luna said mildly as Trevor took advantage of the moment
and leapt out of Neville's grasp. The toad bounded away swiftly and
Dexter tore after him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe he knows
where Bart is!" Gilbert called as he ran after Dexter. Harry and
the others ran after the younger boys until they all crashed into one
another in the doorway of a small room at the end of the corridor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, gross!"
exclaimed Dexter as he backed slowly out of the room. Hamish and
Othello wore similar looks of disgust. Harry peered into the room
before making a face of his own.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told you Bart
was a girl," Luna said dreamily.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sighed
heavily. It was an absolute travesty that the toads at Hogwarts were
getting more action than he was.</p><p class="calibre8">The Gryffindor
Quidditch trials were as much of a farce as they had been in his
sixth year. After Hermione ordered everyone from other Houses off the
pitch, Harry began the tedious process of choosing two Chasers and a
Keeper. Although he had to hold trials for all the positions, Harry
had absolutely no intention of replacing either of the Beaters or
Ginny as Chaser. Luckily Peaks and Cootes outflew and outplayed every
other Beater applicant. The Chaser trial was more involved. The first
three Keeper applicants were more hopeless than Ron had been even on
his worst day and made every Chaser hopeful look brilliant.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen, Ginny,
how are we going to do this?" Harry flew over to her as she hovered
a few feet from the hoops, tossing a Quaffle from one hand to the
other. She looked at him for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Get Ron out
here," she said. "Put him in front of the hoops. If they can get
past him, they'll do."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, but can you?"
Harry grinned. Ginny tucked the Quaffle under her arm and flew right
up to Harry, leaning close.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I'm going
to make the team," she said silkily, "captain." Harry grinned
and watched as she flew over to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">It didn't take Ron
long to grab Peakes's broom and soar out onto the pitch. With Ron
in front of the hoops it was made immediately obvious who the better
Chasers would be. Ginny outflew them all and Harry just sat and
watched her fly. She was going to be a professional Quidditch player,
he was sure of it; she flew like she was born on a broom.</p><p class="calibre8">Once Harry had
selected Lucy Grant, a third year and Brent Robinson from fourth year
to be the two other Chasers, Ron attempted to give the Keeper
hopefuls tips that would enable them to save goals – but Harry was
losing hope. The next three were no better than the first three and
there was only one Keeper applicant left.</p><p class="calibre8">Kyle Thorpe was
perhaps the biggest second year Harry had ever seen. Ron gestured
with his arms and pointed to the hoops while talking animatedly to
Kyle. The boy nodded and Harry could almost see him grit his teeth
with determination as he flew to the hoops. Harry motioned to Lucy to
throw Quaffles at the second year – not wanting to waste his time.
If Kyle couldn't block the weakest of their Chasers he wouldn't
put the poor kid through anymore humiliation. Harry rubbed his
temples wearily. It was nearly lunch time and he was feeling the
strain of building half a Quidditch team.</p><p class="calibre8">"You need to train
a Seeker," Ginny's voice came from nearby. She'd flown over to
watch the Keeper trial. Harry studied her face carefully, unsure
exactly what she meant. She smiled. "You don't want them to have
this sort of trouble next year."</p><p class="calibre8">"I hadn't
thought of that," Harry frowned.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't mean
you shouldn't play," Ginny clarified. "Just think how much
easier it would have been if any of these clods had a clue how to
Keep."</p><p class="calibre8">There was a gasp
from the crowd. Harry turned back to the hoops to see Kyle clinging
precariously to his broomstick. Ron was hovering a short way off,
muttering under his breath. It looked as if he was willing the young
Keeper hopeful to do a good enough job to get on the team. Kyle
straightened on his broomstick and nodded tersely to Lucy who was
holding the Quaffle tentatively. She hurled the Quaffle to the left
of where he was. Harry groaned inwardly; he couldn't imagine the
hefty young man able to get over and block it quickly enough.</p><p class="calibre8">Kyle surprised them
all, flying deftly across and blocking the shot solidly. He
continued, not letting a single one of Lucy's shots through and
Harry nodded to Brent and signalled to him to join Lucy. The two new
Chasers flew together tossing the Quaffle back and forth and
attempting to get a shot past the younger boy.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's mad for
him," Ginny murmured.</p><p class="calibre8">"She is?" Harry
asked. "For who?" Ginny rolled her eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's perfectly
obvious that Lucy wants to be with Brent," she insisted.</p><p class="calibre8">"If you say so,"
muttered Harry. "Hey, home come Dean didn't try out?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You're asking
me?" Ginny shrugged. "He's your roommate." Harry watched the
two Chasers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you <em class="calibre9">sure</em>?"
he asked sceptically. "She doesn't <em class="calibre9">look</em> like she likes
him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah? And how
would you know what a thirteen year old girl looks like when she
likes someone?" Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I remember,"
Harry said quietly, looking at her solemnly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh."</p><p class="calibre8">"So, do you think
Kyle will do?" Harry turned away uncomfortably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably,"
Ginny shrugged. "Do we have any other options?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You go," Harry
said suddenly, turning back to her. Ginny raised an eyebrow at him.
Harry nodded towards the action in front of the hoops. "You go and
see if you can get past him."</p><p class="calibre8">"You just want to
watch me fly," Ginny smirked before she took off, intercepting a
pass and hurling the Quaffle towards the hoops. Kyle was practically
hanging upside down but he saved the goal with outspread fingertips,
knocking the Quaffle to the side. Ron flew over to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
<em class="calibre9">brilliant</em>!" Ron called. Harry nodded absently. Ron made a
noise of disgust. "You're too busy ogling my sister aren't
you?" Harry blushed but did not deny it.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny's hair
streamed behind her and she leaned low on her broomstick as she
swooped past the hoops. Her cheeks were flushed and her body lithe
and supple as she twisted around the posts, trying to trick Kyle and
get a shot in from below. Harry felt an ache for her in his chest. He
wanted to touch her, to hold her, to memorise her. What he wouldn't
give for a few hours, uninterrupted and alone with Ginny Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"I should punch
you for that look," said Ron conversationally. Harry started
guiltily. Ron laughed. "But I want to avoid a Bat Bogey, so I
won't." Harry scowled at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You think he'll
be any good as a Keeper?" he asked Ron pointedly, changing the
subject. Ron nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's your best
hope."</p><p class="calibre8">"George clean you
up okay last week?" Harry asked, watching Ginny feint and get the
Quaffle past Kyle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," replied
Ron quietly. "I don't know what got into us."</p><p class="calibre8">"Firewhisky, by
the look of Hermione," Harry snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Was she … did
she …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Threw up twice,
once in the rose gardens and once on my shoes," said Harry
cheerfully. "Chatted up a suit of armour, felt me up and asked how
I was in bed." He fell about laughing at Ron's incredulous look.</p><p class="calibre8">"She … she
what?" he asked weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She said she was
really lucky because she was with you," Harry said soberly.
"Repeatedly."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione said
that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
nodded. "She was apparently very complimentary, but Ginny won't
tell me about what exactly because she believes it has scarred her
for life and she cannot bear to relive it." Ron went beet red.</p><p class="calibre8">"Reckon you've
picked a decent enough team," Ron said gruffly, "might be time
for lunch." Harry grinned and flew down onto the pitch and
signalled the rest of the team to join him.</p><p class="calibre8">He congratulated the
new team members and set up their first practice for the next
Thursday before heading to the changing rooms. It had been a long
morning. He stretched out on one of the benches in the locker room
and gazed idly at the practice Snitch still zooming around the room.
Harry decided to wait for Ginny to come out of the girls changing
area and started to remove his protective Quidditch gear rather
lazily.</p><p class="calibre8">He had not gotten
very far when he caught Ginny's distinctive scent. He left his
right arm guard hanging from his forearm and twisted so that he could
see her. She smiled at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Exhausted, are
we?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I need something
to sustain me," Harry pouted. "I may not be able to make it off
this bench without it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well now, I shall
have to see what I can do about that," Ginny said softly. She
walked slowly up to him and Harry just watched, waited until she was
close enough to touch and then he reached out a hand and pulled her
down to him. She giggled as she sprawled on top of him on the narrow
bench.</p><p class="calibre8">"Keen," she
noted. Harry said nothing, choosing instead to kiss her.</p><p class="calibre8">The changing rooms
were deserted. Coote and Peakes had left ages ago and the new team
members had not come back there at all, instead going back to their
dormitories to change and it was now lunch time in the castle. For
the first time in a long time Harry was alone with Ginny, and likely
would be for some time. He buried his hands in her hair and pulled
her close.</p><p class="calibre8">"Funny," Ginny
murmured as Harry ran his hands down her back and kissed his way down
her neck, "I thought we weren't going to do it here …" Harry
froze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um …"</p><p class="calibre8">"But," Ginny
looked him in the eye, "here we are … alone … all afternoon …"</p><p class="calibre8">"And you … you
…" Harry stumbled over his words and then pulled her closer and
gave in.</p><p class="calibre8">She smelled heavenly
and she felt divine. Dimly, as he kissed her, Harry felt Ginny finish
removing his remaining Quidditch protection and stroke his arms
softly. He slid his own hands up her arms and lost himself in her
touch, her kiss. Her fingers tangled in his hair and his hands
trailed down her back. He felt small hands slide under his shirt and
he stopped for a moment, sitting up and removing his shirt so that he
could feel her on his skin.</p><p class="calibre8">"You should get a
tattoo," Ginny said in his ear, her hands splayed across his chest.
"A Horntail."</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay," Harry
replied. If she wanted it he would do it, it was that simple. He
couldn't resist her, so when she pressed herself against him he
slid his own hands under her shirt, searching for the soft curves he
knew were there.</p><p class="calibre8">He no longer cared
that they were in the Quidditch changing rooms. He had wanted her all
week and now he had her and she didn't want him to let her go. It
was better than chocolate, better than Firewhisky. He idly wondered
why Ron and Hermione got drunk for her birthday when they could have
had something so much better instead. Then he shuddered at that image
and burying his hands in Ginny's hair he pulled her to him with a
growl before sinking to the ground taking her with him. He could feel
Ginny's leg hooked over his own, her hands on his chest, his
shoulders, his belt …</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!" Harry
froze. It was not a good sign that he could hear Ron; not at all. He
dropped his forehead to Ginny's shoulder, breathing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron," Ginny
said dully, not moving her head, "how lovely to see you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, well, wish
I could say the same," Ron said idly. "Reckon I've seen more of
you than I care to though." He sounded amused. Harry looked up to
see Ron leaning on the door frame; his arms crossed and a smirk on
his face.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny sighed and
pushed Harry off her before straightening her shirt and standing up.
She kissed Harry softly before throwing her brother a filthy look.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're a git,"
she said with venom. "You know that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey, don't
blame me," Ron laughed. "You were the ones going at it in a
public place." Harry sat staring at the wall. How could he look Ron
in the eye after that?</p><p class="calibre8">"We were perfectly
alone," Ginny hissed, "for the first time in <em class="calibre9">ages</em>. Well …
I guess you ruined <em class="calibre9">that</em>." Harry heard her footsteps stomp
away. He turned to see her paused at the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
later, Harry," she sighed. "I've got some work to do anyway."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Just …
tonight's mine, yeah?" she asked. "I'll see you at dinner."
She left. Harry glared at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks, mate,"
he snapped, "thanks a lot." Ron shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't know
you two were …" Ron trailed off, waving his arms hopelessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What? Didn't
know we were what?" Harry demanded snatching up his shirt and
pulling it on furiously. Ron blushed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm … that um,
far , er well that you had …"</p><p class="calibre8">"We haven't,"
Harry ground out. "We're not."</p><p class="calibre8">"Looked like it to
me," Ron smirked at him. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're supposed
to tear me limb from limb," he muttered. "I feel like you're
setting me up." Harry stowed his Quidditch gear in his locker,
straightened up the broom cupboard in the corner and picked up the
Quaffle. He turned around to find Ron sitting on the bench, watching
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not going
to do anything," Ron said. "She loves you and you love her. Only
an idiot would get in the way of that. I just didn't want to watch
it."</p><p class="calibre8">"You could have
turned around and walked away," Harry shouted.</p><p class="calibre8">"No way!" Ron
exclaimed. "And leave myself with that image in my head? Letting it
play out in there until we got to … the climax of the event?"
Harry threw the Quaffle at Ron's head.</p><p class="calibre8">"You … just …"
Harry struggled to find the words. "<em class="calibre9">You</em> should not mention
me and Ginny and climax in the same sentence, ever."</p><p class="calibre8">"Believe me, I
don't want to," Ron held up his arms in mock surrender. "It's
why I couldn't let things reach their … peak." Harry groaned
and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … thanks a
lot," Harry grumbled as he sank down onto the bench next to Ron.
"What were you doing, skulking around the changing rooms anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I was coming to
see if you wanted to go see Hagrid with Hermione and me," Ron said.
"Go have afternoon tea … like old times."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, all right,"
Harry sighed. "I think you ruined the moment well enough, I may as
well."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do me a favour,
Harry," Ron said as they let the door swing shut behind them,
"never let me see you two like that again."</p><p class="calibre8">"Traumatised are
you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"For life," Ron
shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"You should thank
your lucky stars you didn't run into Malfoy," Harry responded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Had that
pleasure, have you?" Ron smirked.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Astronomy
Tower needs a tie on the door handle," Harry grumbled as Ron burst
out laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe you should
get one for the Quidditch changing rooms."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thought had
crossed my mind," Harry grinned at Ron. "Race you to Hagrid's?"
He took off before Ron could answer.</p><p class="calibre8">"How old are you,
Potter," Ron called, "eighteen or eight?" Harry just laughed
and kept running.</p><p class="calibre8">He found Hermione
waiting outside Hagrid's hut. She was staring absently at the
pumpkin patch.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione!"
called Harry as he approached. She didn't respond. Harry slowed
down and walked up to her, he could hear Ron thumping after him and
he reached out and touched Hermione on the arm and she jumped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello, Harry,"
Hermione said vaguely. Her eyes flicked to Ron. "I think
something's up with Hagrid." Ron's brow furrowed and Harry
raised an eyebrow at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like what?" Ron
asked, leaning against one of the huge pumpkins and slapping it.
"Hallowe'en pumpkins look good this year."</p><p class="calibre8">"He won't let me
in," Hermione stared at the door of the hut, her brows drawn
together. "He's hiding something."</p><p class="calibre8">"When is he not?"
Harry asked, leaning against the same huge pumpkin as Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Little dragon or
big spider?" Ron asked contemplatively.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, he's done
that before," mused Hermione. With a start Harry realised she was
serious. "What dangerous creature <em class="calibre9">hasn't</em> he been involved
with lately?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't be daft,
Hermione," Ron said, laughing. "Maybe … he's got a lady
friend and that's why he won't let us in."</p><p class="calibre8">"Have you met
Hagrid, Ron?" Hermione asked pointedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He could still
have a woman," Ron protested. He jerked a thumb at Harry. "If
this scrawny git can get himself a bird, Hagrid can."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you just use
the term 'bird', Ron?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We-ell …"</p><p class="calibre8">"And for your
information, Ron Weasley," Hermione glared at him, "Harry happens
to be wizarding Britain's most eligible bachelor. He's hardly a
scrawny git."</p><p class="calibre8">"You fancy him
too, don't you?" Ron asked her morosely.</p><p class="calibre8">"No!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I wouldn't
blame you if you did-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Merlin's
balls!" exclaimed Harry exasperatedly. "You're a right git, you
know that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What has gotten
into you?" Hermione asked, glaring at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"He said you felt
him up," Ron hissed. Hermione raised an eyebrow at Harry who
groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are not
telling me you have been worrying about that," he said, turning to
Ron. "She was drunk!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks, Harry,
tell the world," Hermione said dryly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you said
it!" Ron protested, stabbing a finger at Harry. "You said she
asked how you were in bed!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I-I … what?"
Hermione looked horrified.</p><p class="calibre8">"Relax," Harry
held his hands up in surrender before they both lynched him. "She
wanted to know why my shirt was undone-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why was it?"
Ron interrupted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you remember
not five minutes ago?" Harry glared at him. "It was like <em class="calibre9">that</em>.
So anyway she wasn't really feeling me up, she was looking for my
tattoo, because she was drunk."</p><p class="calibre8">"You haven't got
a tattoo," Ron commented sullenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know!" Harry
exclaimed. He looked around at his best friends. Ron was staring
intently into the Forbidden Forest and Hermione was studying the
ground.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay, right …
good," Harry muttered. "Let's go see Hagrid."</p><p class="calibre8">"Wait a minute,"
Hermione spoke softly, as if it took her great effort. "In what
context would I even ask how you were … in bed?" Harry burst out
laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"You were asking
<em class="calibre9">Ginny</em>!" he snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why did you not
tell me any of this?" Hermione demanded. Harry shrugged. Ron
glowered at Harry sullenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly Ron, she
was just tipsy," Harry clapped a hand on Ron's shoulder. "You
rated higher than Krum." Ron brightened visibly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh honestly,"
Hermione grumbled, stomping to Hagrid's door. She raised a fist to
bang on it, calling out to Hagrid as she did so.</p><p class="calibre8">The effect was
instantaneous. Hagrid's big, shaggy head appeared and he was
wearing a scowl.</p><p class="calibre8">"What d'ye think
ye're doin'?" he demanded gruffly.</p><p class="calibre8">"We came to tea,"
Hermione said primly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, not today,"
Hagrid said and attempted to close the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
hiding?" Hermione demanded, casting a spell Harry had never seen
before. Hagrid was unable to close the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing,
nothing," said Hagrid. He was starting to sound desperate.
"Hermione, you've got to let me close the door!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why? What have
you got in there?" queried Ron. "Is it something that'll bite
our heads off?"</p><p class="calibre8">Hagrid turned white.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, not at all,"
he protested. "It's nuthin'. Nuthin' at all." The huge man
attempted to look casual as he leaned uneasily against the door jamb.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it can't
be worse than a baby dragon," muttered Hermione. "Hagrid, this is
<em class="calibre9">us</em>. We won't tell. You know we won't."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ye've a knack
fer getting' inter trouble, ye three," Hagrid muttered
mutinously. "I'll not be responsible, no I won't."</p><p class="calibre8">"So you do have
something in there, then?" Harry took a step towards the hut.
Hagrid jumped and gripped the door, glancing nervously back inside.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, no, nuthin in
here… Why don't you jus' run along now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid… have
you been collecting things from blokes down the pub?" asked Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't
collect anythin' wrong!" Hagrid exclaimed. Harry, Ron and
Hermione shared a look.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid, have you
got a creature in there?" Hermione asked patiently. Hagrid shook
his head hesitantly. Hermione crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow
at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's nuthin'
fer you lot ter be worryin' about," Hagrid said with an attempt
at finality. Harry attempted to peer inside. He caught a glimpse of a
rather large cage with something hairy inside it before Hagrid
stepped in front of it.</p><p class="calibre8">"I have a very bad
feeling about this," muttered Ron warily. "This sort of thing
usually ends in tears."</p><p class="calibre8">"There's nothing
regulated or illegal goin' on Ron," Hagrid insisted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good, you can let
us in then." Hermione darted under Hagrid's arm into the hut.</p><p class="calibre8">"No! Hermione!"
Hagrid shouted. Harry heard Hermione squawk before going silent and
Ron charged past both of them before Harry had even breathed. Harry
followed Ron as fast as he could and the three of them stood in
Hagrid's doorway staring at a cage in the middle of the hut.</p><p class="calibre8">"What is that
thing?" Hermione breathed.</p><p class="calibre8">"No way," Ron
muttered, staring in awe.</p><p class="calibre8">The thing inside the
cage had five fat legs and looked like a short, hairy starfish. It
had a vicious looking mouth full of sharp teeth but was only about
the size of Hagrid's palm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid," Harry
said slowly, staring at the thing inside the cage. "Where'd you
get a <em class="calibre9">Quintaped</em>?" Hermione turned to look at him in
surprise.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know what
that is?" she asked him. "How?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I can read,
Hermione. I did the essay from <em class="calibre9">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find
Them</em>, same as you," Harry said haughtily. Ron sniggered. The
Quintaped suddenly lunged forward; the bars on the crudely
constructed wooden cage rattled and threatened to give way.</p><p class="calibre8">"You 'ave to get
out of 'ere," Hagrid said desperately. "He can smell yer."</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't keep
that here!" Ron said. "You have got to get rid of it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But he's just a
baby!"</p><p class="calibre8">"How can you
possibly know?" Hermione asked, edging away from the cage.</p><p class="calibre8">"Watched him
hatch, I did," said Hagrid proudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But where did you
get a Quintaped?" asked Harry. "I mean, no one can get to them!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I didn't
know it were a Qunitaped when I bought th' egg," Hagrid said
reasonably. "But 'e said it were such a great bargain and 'e
were right too. You don't just get a Quintaped for four Galleons
and five sickles!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't just
<em class="calibre9">get</em> a Quintaped!" Ron cried as the creature made another run
at the bars of the cage. He pulled Hermione behind him and faced the
hairy beast nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't keep
it at school, Hagrid," Harry said. Hagrid looked so downcast that
Hermione seemed to take pity on him. She withdrew her wand and making
a few complicated wand movements and muttering under her breath,
transformed the rickety, wooden box into a steel cage.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Hermione," Hagrid beamed and pulled her into a hug.</p><p class="calibre8">"No problem,
Hagrid," Hermione replied when she got her breath back. "But if I
see one <em class="calibre9">hint</em> of that thing anywhere other than in this hut …
and only until he's grown. Then you have to take him back!"
Hermione shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stay fer tea,"
Hagrid said, throwing the door wide open.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm … no
thanks, I think we need to be getting back now …" said Ron,
eyeing the Quintaped warily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Suit yerself,"
Hagrid called cheerily as the three of them backed out of the door.
"We'll have tea next time. Monty'll like that!" Harry waved
at Hagrid and beat a hasty retreat with Ron and Hermione. They got to
the door of the castle before Ron spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"Monty?" he said
incredulously. "He called that monster <em class="calibre9">Monty</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Monty the
Monster," mused Hermione, pushing open the great oak doors. "It's
got a certain charm …"</p><p class="calibre8">"How does <em class="calibre9">anyone</em>
get a Quintaped?" asked Harry. "Isn't that island unplottable?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Question of the
century, isn't it?" Ron said. "But this <em class="calibre9">is</em> Hagrid."
Harry just grunted and the three of them made their way upstairs and
into the common room where a rather large shouting match was in
progress. Kyle Thorpe was in the middle of the room nose to nose with
a massive fourth year who strongly resembled Cormac McClaggen.</p><p class="calibre8">"- <em class="calibre9">she</em>
obviously gets special treatment!" the fourth year was yelling.</p><p class="calibre8">"No one got
special treatment, Brogan McClaggen," Kyle shouted back. "You
just can't save a goal to save your ruddy life!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh and you can?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Course he can! He
made Keeper, didn't he?" Dexter piped up from his perch on the
back of one of the common room chairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"I should have
made Keeper!" Brogan snarled his fists clenched. He turned on
Dexter who eyed him carefully before climbing down into the chair he
was perched on. He stepped on Hamish in the process, who punched him
in the leg.</p><p class="calibre8">"You played
rubbish and you know it!" threw in one of the spectators.</p><p class="calibre8">"I did not!"
Brogan swung around to the hapless student. "Potter is just a … a
…"</p><p class="calibre8">"A what?"
sneered Dennis Creevey.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
prejudiced!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh my, you really
are a deluded little toerag, aren't you?" Seamus interjected at
that point. He stood up and strode towards Brogan. The fact that the
fourth year was bigger than Seamus did nothing to deter the older
boy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now look here,"
Brogan protested. "You can't go calling me that! I'm going to
find a Prefect and have him do something about your uncouth
behaviour."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh look, he's a
tattle-tale too," Seamus said casually.</p><p class="calibre8">"Five points from
Gryffindor for being a tattle-tale," Neville said lazily from his
seat in front of the fireplace where he was playing Monopoly with
Dean. The common room let out a collective groan.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't do
that!" exclaimed Brogan, going red in the face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Actually," said
Neville, unwinding himself slowly and standing up, "I think you'll
find I can. You see, I, unlike you, am a Prefect."</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably in
Potter's pocket too then," muttered Brogan. "Just like that
little bint he calls his girlfriend."</p><p class="calibre8">Ron didn't even
try to hold Harry back but Neville got there before him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you
<em class="calibre9">dare</em>," Neville said in a low, ominous voice. "Never, <em class="calibre9">ever</em>
insult Ginny Weasley."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're not in
charge anymore, Longbottom," sneered Brogan. "You don't need to
defend your piece of fluff any more."</p><p class="calibre8">Brogan found his
neck pressed against the wrong end of Neville's wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"This has got
nothing to do with who's in charge," said Neville quietly. "It's
pretty much all about you being a bullying, arrogant, idiotic
imitation of a mountain troll."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not scared
of you," Brogan scoffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You should be,"
Neville snarled. "Now apologise."</p><p class="calibre8">"Weasley's not
even here," Brogan smirked.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think <em class="calibre9">Harry</em>
would like to hear it," Neville said menacingly. Harry remained
frozen, halfway across the room where he'd stopped on his way to
beat Brogan to a bloody pulp. The whole common room turned to look at
him. Neville continued. "Now Kyle is on the Quidditch team and you
are not. Are you ready to deal with that without mocking the man who
would have <em class="calibre9">died</em> to save your sorry arse, and completely
slagging off his girl?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's not got
anything to do with Quidditch," Brogan said, attempting to show a
modicum of bravado.</p><p class="calibre8">"You idiot,"
Dean called from his seat by the fire. "Harry is the youngest
Quidditch player in a century and has played more games than <em class="calibre9">anyone</em>
else in this castle!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not some
Harry Potter groupie," declared Brogan. "Just 'cause <em class="calibre9">you</em>
all think he's so great. It can't be all that hard to kill a dark
wizard."</p><p class="calibre8">"Merlin's
balls," exclaimed Seamus. "Draco Malfoy is friendlier than you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe he's a
closet Slytherin," piped up Dennis Creevey.</p><p class="calibre8">"Potter didn't
even kill the bastard properly the first time and we had to go
through it all again, years later," Brogan said, looking quite
crazed. He sneered at Harry who just stood there, his mind a total
blank.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!" yelled Ron
suddenly. "Have you completely lost your grip on reality?" He
strode towards Brogan McClaggen and grabbed his collar with one large
hand, hauling him forward and dragging his neck ruthlessly along the
end of Neville's wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Weasley are you
mad?" Brogan's brave façade was cracking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, absolutely,"
Ron snarled. "You insulted my sister and just trashed my best mate.
You bet I'm mad."</p><p class="calibre8">"So, Brogan, got
anything else to say?" Neville asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, you're
all completely bonkers!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, you
misunderstood Neville here," said Seamus, flicking his wand almost
casually. "We wondered if you had anything <em class="calibre9">meaningful</em> to
say." Brogan moved his mouth frantically but no sound came out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nice non-verbal,"
Ron complimented, still holding Brogan hostage.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
grinned Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think …"
Neville squinted dramatically at Brogan. "I think he's trying to
tell us we can't do this to him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, he might be
right …" Hermione said thoughtfully. Brogan turned to her as far
as he could in Ron's grip, gesturing frantically, gratefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"What? Hermione-"</p><p class="calibre8">"He might hurt
himself," Hermione interrupted. She flicked her wand at Brogan.
"<em class="calibre9">Petrificus Totalus</em>." Then she levitated him out of Ron's
grasp and to the portrait hole. "You'll be much safer this way
while we go and see Mr Filch. He's not had a lot of people to serve
detention lately. I'm sure he'll be very happy to see you."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry heard a
muffled thump and Hermione muttering insincere apologies as she
clambered through the portrait hole after Brogan's floating body.
Ron stared around the common room at the awed faces of the rest of
Gryffindor House.</p><p class="calibre8">"Show's over,"
he said briskly reaching out to grab Harry by the arm and propel him
to the fireplace. "Go back to your knitting." Harry sank into a
chair. He still hadn't said anything and stared into the flames.
The rest of the common room gradually returned to normal, a buzz of
conversation muffling the strains of the wireless in the corner.</p><p class="calibre8">"That kid spent
the last year in a cushy safe-house in France," Seamus said as he
threw himself on the hearth rug. Neville sat down again and picked up
the die on the Monopoly board.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hasn't got a
clue," murmured Dean.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe he's got
a point," muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, on his
<em class="calibre9">head</em>," Ron rolled his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"It isn't all
that hard to kill a dark wizard," Harry said softly. "And it is
my fault Voldemort came back and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"You are as thick
as McClaggen," said Ron, throwing a cushion in Harry's direction.</p><p class="calibre8">"But-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
about you, but last year was pretty hard to me," Ron sat up
straight and glared at him. "Most of these kids know that, he's
just one idiot."</p><p class="calibre8">"Most of these
kids weren't even here last year," Seamus said, rummaging in his
bag and pulling out a sheaf of parchment. "Everyone's lost a
family member. Too many of 'em have lost parents. There're no
kids in Slytherin who're missing parents. They know where they are
even if they happen to be in Azkaban or in the ground."</p><p class="calibre8">"Seamus!"
remonstrated Neville. Seamus ignored him and unfurled his parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a heap
of Ravenclaws who're missing a parent, mostly their dads," he
said softly, scanning the parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lots of Ministry
workers," commented Dean. "We might be able to find them if we
can figure out where all those Ministry workers went into hiding. The
Hufflepuffs ... lots of their homes got attacked. It's like he went
after groups systematically or something. This one kid told me he got
sent away to his aunt's house in the country and while he was gone
his mum and dad nearly got crushed in their home. They're okay
though. Parents turned up on the doorstep one day and they've
stayed with the aunt ever since. She was glad because her husband
never came home from work one day."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not always
missing though," Seamus said thoughtfully, tapping the parchment.
"There's a first year Ravenclaw here … his parents got a one
way ticket to St Mungo's permanent care ward after Death Eaters
turned up in the dead of night."</p><p class="calibre8">"What … where's
he living now?" Neville's knuckles were white as he gripped the
arms of the chair he was sitting in. Seamus scanned his parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Looks like his …
aunt, dad's sister," he replied. "Only magical relative he has
left."</p><p class="calibre8">The litany of death
and destruction hung over Harry like a heavy blanket. He'd been
shielded, he realised. Kingsley and Molly and Arthur must have been
shielding him from the real aftermath. Harry thought he might vomit.
He clenched his fists and stared resolutely into the flames in the
fireplace. He could almost see people in the flames screaming and
trying to claw their way out as Death Eaters burned their homes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Most of
Gryffindor went into hiding, I reckon," Dean said. "Whole
families left the country until June but some of 'em just don't
know anymore. I found three first years and one second year who ended
up in the Muggle foster system."</p><p class="calibre8">"How'd they end
up with Muggles?" asked Ron, leaning forward.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum and dad never
came home," Dean shrugged. "One of the firsties is Muggleborn.
Got her Hogwarts letter but next thing her house got blown up. She
was at a sleepover party but ended up in the Muggle system and the
Ministry must have given up looking for her."</p><p class="calibre8">"Too much red tape
for the dimwit Death Eaters, I suppose." Hermione's voice came
from behind Harry. She slid onto Ron's lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"So she missed
last year entirely," Dean continued. "McGonagall put her in first
year since she was Muggleborn and utterly overwhelmed. I don't know
exactly what happened with the others, but they were all in a safe
house together. I think they got attacked and their parents were …
killed and the Muggle authorities got there first."</p><p class="calibre8">"Flitwick went and
found them all this summer," Seamus said quietly. "They don't
even know where they are going <em class="calibre9">next</em> summer. They couldn't
tell the foster parents about magic. He and some Ministry officials
did some memory charms and removed them from the Muggle records but …
there's nowhere for them to go in the wizarding world either."</p><p class="calibre8">"So they've lost
their families and their homes?" asked Hermione softly. Dean
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's pretty
sorry state of affairs when you've got homeless kiddies and
everyone's too busy running around trying to fix everything else to
care," Dean said gruffly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do they think no
one cares?" Harry asked softly, his voice scratchy.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think mostly
they're grateful to be here, you know?" Dean said. "I don't
think they've even thought ahead to the holidays."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do they have any
wizarding orphanages or … foster things?" Ron tilted his head to
the side. "What's a foster anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's when they
place children with approved families in the event they lose their
own," Hermione said, picking at a thread on her robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"They must have a
procedure for it," Dean said. He looked at Hermione. "Don't
they?" Hermione shrugged and looked sideways at Harry briefly
before averting her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know,"
muttered Harry venomously. "And you'd think I <em class="calibre9">would</em>,
wouldn't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I think most kids
who um, need a home … erm, end up with … um, family," said
Neville hesitantly after a pause. "It's not official, it just
sort of … happens."</p><p class="calibre8">"So what …
they're just going to leave it up to some arbitrary wizard to
decide on a whim?" asked Harry bitterly. "They're not stray
kittens! You can't just shove 'em on someone's doorstep!"</p><p class="calibre8">He felt like he was
watching himself from a far-off distance. He had no idea where his
bitterness was coming from. Harry didn't hate Dumbledore for what
he'd felt forced to do and no longer blamed the old man, if he ever
had. He couldn't really remember, everything felt so confused; so
fuzzy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right, Harry?" Hermione said softly, her concerned face peering at
him. Harry nodded, trying to focus on what Seamus had been saying.</p><p class="calibre8">"- cos Everard
Fingleman reckons his old man sent him a tin with a lock of hair in,"
Seamus shook his head. "He thinks it came from Egypt, the tin had
these markings on them and his mum says they are Egyptian. I dunno
how anyone would have gotten there without using Apparition but
that's what he reckons."</p><p class="calibre8">"You can get there
on a plane," Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"So he reckons
this is a sign from his dad that he made it to Egypt then?" Dean
asked. Seamus shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"We don't have
any other clues about where to start looking," Ron said idly
tracing patterns on Hermione's thigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well we've got
to do something," Seamus said restlessly. "A couple of the
younger Ravenclaws said the goblins were threatening to take back
their homes because of non payment with their dads gone and mums
still looking after little ones at home. A couple of them have
already had to move house and there's not a lot of undamaged
wizarding real estate around at the moment. One kid reckons they'll
have to move into a Muggle squash or something." Seamus looked very
distressed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I reckon you
might mean 'flat', mate," said Dean, choking back laughter.
"It's like having a bunch of houses sort of all joined together
and … stacked up."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sounds squashed,"
Seamus argued. Dean only nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, where would
these homeless kids go then?" Ron said with a shudder. "The ones
the Muggles got hold of? First they lose their family and then,
'cause the Death Eater brigade has damaged so many wizarding
houses, they just get shut up in some Muggle squash-box with
festering parents?"</p><p class="calibre8">"A flat's not so
bad, Ron," Hermione said. She was stroking his hair affectionately,
"and it's foster parents."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well <em class="calibre9">I</em>
wouldn't like to live in some Muggle neighbourhood after all year
at school," Ron grumbled. "Especially not in some squashy, box
place."</p><p class="calibre8">"That all look the
same," Dean added. Harry could only wholeheartedly agree.</p><p class="calibre8">"I mean, I'd
rather live in a cave if it was in the wizarding world and had proper
wizarding plumbing and things," Ron argued stubbornly. "I've
seen ekeltric light switches and I wouldn't want to live in a house
with them lurking on my walls." Dean tried unsuccessfully to
smother his snort of laughter. Ron glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, Ron,"
said Neville with a resigned air, "if you have a wizarding house
just lying around empty, feel free to hand it over and the problem's
solved." Harry stared at Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I'm
rolling in houses," Ron drawled. "I got my estate out west and a
little cottage in the country and in the winter I go and spend time
in my London townhouse." Neville laughed and began packing away the
Monopoly set.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sat up
straight. <em class="calibre9">He</em> had an empty wizarding house in London. It might
be as dank as a cave now, but they'd seen what Kreacher could do
when he put his mind to it. They could fix up Number Twelve,
Grimmauld Place. It had plenty of space for several children. All he
needed to do was find someone to look after them. He had to talk to
Ginny. He didn't want to just give away his house without talking
to her, even though he knew she would agree. It just didn't feel
right to make that decision without her. He stood up suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You got an empty
house lying about, mate?" asked Dean with a grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah I do,"
Harry said hurriedly. "Hey listen, Neville, where <em class="calibre9">is</em> Ginny?"
Neville suddenly flushed a deep crimson colour.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, she was
sort of helping me and … erm …" Neville stumbled over his words
before forcing them out in a rush. "I accidentally sprayed her with
Stinksap when we moved the <em class="calibre9">Mimbulous Mimbletonia</em> and when I
tried <em class="calibre9">Scourgify</em> I kinda made it worse and turned all the
Stinksap brown." Ron chuckled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Smelt worse,
too," Dean added helpfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"She went to the
Prefect's bathroom to wash it off properly," Neville said
glowering at Dean.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," said
Harry. "Well … I'll just go wait for her then." He started
towards the entrance of the common room.</p><p class="calibre8">"No peeking!"
Ron called out after him. Harry gave him a two-fingered salute as he
clambered out of the portrait hole.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry ambled down to
the Prefect's Bathroom on the fifth floor. He contemplated ducking
into an empty classroom to avoid Peeves who was throwing water bombs
on the sixth floor, but Peeves looked up after cackling and drenching
a pair of snogging Ravenclaws and simply waved at Harry before
gliding through the ceiling. Harry shook his head and continued down
to the Prefect's Bathroom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lemon Zest,"
Harry muttered. The door remained closed. Someone must have changed
the password. He thumped on the door. "Ginny? It's me, Harry, are
you decent?" His only answer was a squelching sound and he pushed
experimentally on the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry, I had it
sealed," Ginny called out as he cautiously stuck his head in. He
looked around tentatively and slammed his eyes shut.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny Weasley was
standing on the edge of a very bubbly bath, a white towel barely
covering her and water dripping from her hair as she wrung it out.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought … I
asked … I … bugger," Harry spluttered as he turned around.
Ginny giggled. He could hear her splashing towards him, her bare feet
making little slapping sounds on the watery tiles. He drew in a
ragged breath as she stood close enough so that he could feel her
warmth.</p><p class="calibre8">In fact, it was
overall too warm in this bathroom and … very steamy. His glasses
had fogged up and he took them off, attempting to clear them. He
realised that without his glasses on he couldn't see and therefore
he wouldn't be able to see what Ginny was, or rather, wasn't
wearing. He chanced a glance at her. It was not a very sound plan.
She was so close he could see every freckle on her face and the way
the water dripped over her shoulders and rolled down into the top of
her towel. He shoved his glasses hastily back on and then groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">Sweet Merlin, she
was trying to kill him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry …"</p><p class="calibre8">Her breath on his
neck was very intoxicating and the way she pressed against him was
nothing short of amazing. She smelt heavenly and she was still a
little bit pink from her warm bath. She pressed a soft kiss to the
base of his throat and slid her arms around his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"I asked … I
thought you were decent," Harry breathed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I'm feeling
very decent," Ginny giggled. She shifted slightly and it was then
Harry realised that the only thing holding up her towel was him. He
grabbed hold of her waist to pin the towel in place but then she
reached up to kiss him and he pulled her closer.</p><p class="calibre8">It was the worst
thing in the world, it was the best thing in the world and Harry gave
in, running his hands over her, feeling her skin and letting his body
take over. He vaguely wondered what Ron would say and decided he
didn't care. Just as he got up the nerve to venture under the towel
a muffled gasp from behind got his attention. Harry whirled around
and Ginny squeaked and grabbed at the towel as it fell slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ooooh Harry,"
Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the edge of the bath, her ghostly feet
in the water. She had a sly grin on her face and was looking at him
through her eyelashes. She lowered her voice and giggled. "Are you
going do it? Here? You wouldn't be the first you know. I watched
Sirius Black and Alex Parker do it right over there. They managed to
break three of the taps." She pointed vaguely to the other side of
the huge bathtub. Harry swallowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Myrtle," was
all he said. The ghost giggled and Harry heard Ginny gathering her
clothes.</p><p class="calibre8">This was definitely
not his day.</p>
