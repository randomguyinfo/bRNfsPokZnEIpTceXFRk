			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Ceremony</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The
next morning's Daily Prophet had Harry as front page news. His
appearance at Godric's Hollow was apparently really big news and
they even put a large poster insert of him in the edition. Harry just
rolled his eyes but Charlie and George took the insert out and gave
it to Ginny as she came downstairs for breakfast. Not realising what
it was she sleepily opened it and then smiled dreamily at the moving
picture of Harry taken the previous day as he smiled and spoke to
people in the little square.</p><p class="calibre8">"Need
some spellotape, Ginny?" asked George.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
get some for you!" said Charlie rummaging in a drawer in one of the
sideboards that lined the kitchen walls.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
help you come and put it up on your bedroom wall, come on!" said
George, grabbing her arm and pulling her in the direction of the
stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"
sputtered Ginny, "Hey, hang on!" She blushed fiercely as she
pulled away from him, thrusting the poster back into his hands and
stomped over to a chair at the kitchen table, reaching for some
bacon.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
are you lot teasing her so much lately?" demanded Hermione,
emerging from the rest of the Daily Prophet. George shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
our sister, that's our job," said Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
give it here," said Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"What,
you want to put it up above <em class="calibre9">your</em>
bed, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
thickhead," Harry rolled his eyes at George. "Got a quill
Hermione?" Hermione produced one from a pocket and George fetched a
pot of ink from the same drawer as the spellotape. Moving the
breakfast dishes, Harry spread the poster out on the table and began
scribbling in the corner of it. He finished with a flourish, flapped
it a little to dry the ink and then presented it to Ginny with a kiss
on the cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
this?" asked Ginny, more than a little suspiciously. Harry
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Six
years ago Fred told me you'd be wanting my autograph. Sorry it took
so long." Ginny unfolded the sheet of newspaper and read, scrawled
in Harry's writing <em class="calibre9">'Dearest Ginny,
Remember that a piece of me is always yours. All my love, Harry
Potter xxx'</em>. Ginny smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
she whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Anytime,"
Harry said softly. The look they shared was cut short abruptly by a
head appearing in the fireplace.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
Harry," said Kingsley, "just the man I wanted to talk to."</p><p class="calibre8">"When's
the ceremony?" interrupted Harry. Kingsley seemed floored by that
question. Harry persisted.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Order of Merlin Ceremony, when is it scheduled?"</p><p class="calibre8">"In
two weeks. The twentieth," answered Kingsley.</p><p class="calibre8">"Alright,
I'll talk to reporters then," said Harry sounding so final that
Kingsley opened and closed his mouth abruptly before nodding and
pulling his head from the fireplace. Harry turned around to see the
occupants of the kitchen staring at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You
autographed your own picture?" Hermione was bemused.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
going to an Order of Merlin Ceremony, as the guest of honour?"
Ginny was dubious.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
going to talk to reporters?" George was incredulous.</p><p class="calibre8">"Willingly?" Charlie was sceptical.
Harry shrugged. He paused, looking thoughtful.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
going to need new dress robes aren't I?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
are you and what have you done with Harry Potter?" asked George.
Harry simply grinned at George.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think he grew up."</p><p class="calibre8">**********************</p><p class="calibre8">In
the end it was Mrs Weasley who went to Diagon Alley to get Harry some
new dress robes. Ron warned him they would likely match his eyes but
Harry didn't care. He spent the two weeks peacefully, at The Burrow
having long sleep ins, playing chess with Ron, degnoming the garden
or finding quiet moments alone with Ginny. Every few days he went
over to see Andromeda and Teddy. Ginny usually went with him and they
spent hours at a time taking care of the infant while Andromeda
rested. Harry noticed that Teddy seemed to prefer turquoise hair but
he would often change it to red when he saw Ginny. As he came up to
three months old Teddy began smiling more and more and recognising
both Harry and Ginny. Harry found himself looking forward to the
visits more and more as Teddy became more responsive to him.</p><p class="calibre8">After
a week or so Percy and Mr Weasley returned to work at the Ministry
and Bill and Fleur went back to work at Gringotts. Charlie, unwilling
to return to Romania just yet remained at The Burrow helping his
mother with odd jobs during the day and preventing his father from
destroying Muggle appliances in his shed at night. Hermione was
trying to locate her parents using Muggle methods in nearby Ottery St
Catchpole. The busy pursuits of most of The Burrow's occupants did
nothing to hide the fact that George spent most of his time, alone,
in his room.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
had thought George would be returning to his shop but he'd made no
mention of it. Three days before the Order of Merlin Ceremony, when
Harry and Ginny were visiting Teddy, Ron had a long talk with George
and they must have come to some sort of understanding or arrangement
because the next day George and Ron went to Diagon Alley soon after
breakfast and returned just before lunch. They were both animated and
Ron was busy drawing up some sort of plan on a large piece of
parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
that?" Harry asked, snatching a sandwich from the plate in the
middle of the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Plans
for the shop," Ron said absently. "It's mostly okay but there's
a bit of damage to the outside and a lot of the stock is wrecked. We
have to rebuild some of it and make some more stock."</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
scribbled furiously for moment before grabbing a sandwich and chewing
thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
are you going to re-open it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
aiming for August," Ron replied. "Want it open before Hogwarts
goes back."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
didn't see a lot of Ron after that. He was either repairing the
shop or helping George create the customary explosions from his
bedroom.</p><p class="calibre8">Life
neither went on nor stopped for Harry those two weeks. Despite his
foray into the public arena at Godric's Hollow he was reluctant to
go out in public again. Although he had no further panic attacks he
couldn't be sure if that was because everything was so normal and
predictable and they wouldn't have happened anyway or if he was
getting over them. He had the odd nightmare but they seemed less
intense somehow. Bill and Fleur returned to The Burrow each evening
and told stories about the rebuilding of Diagon Alley.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
saw Mr Ollivander this afternoon," Bill said one night. "He's
going to re-open his shop. Just as well, that Pothart fellow was a
terrible wandmaker."</p><p class="calibre8">"Deed
you 'ear ze bang from zat man wiz ze Pot'art wand?" Fleur shook
her head. "Eet was bigger zan ze 'ole from ze dragon." Harry,
Ron and Hermione ducked their heads while Ginny sniggered into her
mashed potatoes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
it was not the wand … but the wizard?" Percy suggested.</p><p class="calibre8">"Non,"
Fleur replied. " 'e never did zat wiz his old wand." She seemed
very serious but George and Ron were openly sniggering about the
inappropriate connotations in her speech.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
ice cream parlour has opened up again," Bill added, frowning at
Ron. "I thought it was Florean at first but it's his nephew.
Seems old Florean never came back …" The mood grew somber for a
moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"I,
ah, met his nephew," Harry said quietly clearing his throat. "That
summer before third year after I blew up my aunt and ran away."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
wish we hadn't gone to Egypt that summer," Mrs Weasley said
fretfully, heaping Harry's plate with more potatoes and piling
carrots onto Ron's. "You could have come here instead of had to
stay in that dingy pub."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
was fine," Harry said. "I had a good time that summer. Florean
used to give me free ice cream and help me with my homework."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
probably ate too much ice cream," Mrs Weasley said disapprovingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably,"
Harry shrugged and smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">The
following day Mr Weasley and Percy talked animatedly about the
changes at the Ministry but Harry felt strangely detached. It was as
if they were talking underwater in a language he didn't understand.
Harry thought he should be doing something about the Ministry but
didn't really know how and definitely felt like he didn't want
to. He spent the day before the Ministry's Ceremony down by the
pond with Ginny. They talked about the Quidditch league starting up
again, Teddy who had started smiling and the possibility of going to
Australia with Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think Mum'll like it," Ginny sighed, lying on her stomach
by the pond's edge. "I'm not exactly of age."</p><p class="calibre8">"She
might let you …" Harry trailed off, knowing it was unlikely. "I
don't want to leave you." He turned to Ginny and watched as she
lazily prodded a caterpillar with a twig.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me
either," Ginny said so softly he barely heard her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Might
not be able to go anyway," Harry said. "Hermione reckons their
Ministry is a bit particular about who they let come to the country.
Only one way to Portkey in and she can't figure out where her
parents have gone anyway; something about privacy laws or something
Muggle."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought she put in paperwork to travel?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
has," Harry shrugged. "She reckons she'll go alone if she has
to but …" Harry didn't say anything further even though the
thought of Hermione travelling alone made both Harry and Ron very
anxious.</p><p class="calibre8">The
three were still in negotiations about who would go and when. Ron was
unwilling to leave George and equally unwilling to let Hermione
travel alone. Harry was reluctant to leave Ginny but had promised
Hermione they'd go and get her parents. After all the things they
had shared together over the years and their general inseparability,
this inability to figure out the adventure was beginning to wear on
all three of them.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
should just go," Ginny said softly, her face turned up to catch the
sun's rays. "I'll be okay, and you won't be long, will you?"
Harry, who was lying next to her on his stomach reached out to stroke
her fingers.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
I'll miss you," he said quietly. "I said we could be together
now. If I go away again, we can't be together." He rolled onto
his back, screwing up his eyes against the sun, his fingers plucking
at the grass.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Harry," cried Ginny, she placed her hand over Harry's heart.
"We'd still be together, in here. When you leave, if I know
you're coming back to me we're together, even when we are apart.
We were together all last year because I knew you were coming back to
me." Harry gazed up at her as she leant over him, her hand resting
on his chest and her hair falling out of the hastily constructed
ponytail it had been put in that morning. It cureled around her face
in the humidity of the June afternoon.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
didn't feel like we were together," he whispered. "I missed you
so much."</p><p class="calibre8">"Me
too," Ginny breathed as she lowered her head and met his lips with
her own. The rest of her hair came tumbling down as Harry threaded
his hands into her hair, pulling her closer and deepening the kiss.
He ran his hands down her back and pulled her to him, her hair
falling like a curtain around their heads as they kissed. Harry could
feel little trails of heat where Ginny's hands traced the muscles
on his chest through the thin cotton of his T shirt and moved to rest
on his waist. Their legs and feet entwined and Harry rolled over,
pinning Ginny beneath him. It was a slow and sensual kiss not at all
rushed and Harry felt like it was getting hotter laying out there in
the June sunshine while Ginny's small hands slid up under his T
Shirt and ran up his spine.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!"
They hastily broke apart at the sound of Ron's voice and looked
over to see him glaring at them while George stood at his elbow and
smirked. "Can't you two keep your hands to yourselves?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
stated Ginny, "and why would we want to?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
I don't want to see it, that's why, you know that!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No
one invited you to look, Ronald!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
if you carry on in public like this I don't have much choice do I?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
so would you rather we 'carried on' in strict privacy, you know
where you can't see us, no one to stop us…" Ginny trailed off
an evil grin on her face and Harry blushed tomato red.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
– well … that's just … the thing is … oh that's
completely beside the point!" Ron, white faced and stammering
turned to George. "Tell her!" George shook his head mutely he was
clearly enjoying this little show.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
you two figure out exactly where the boundaries of our relationship
are, and in which areas we can conduct it, you let me know, okay?"
Harry snapped and strode off into the house. Ginny was screeching at
Ron but Harry didn't pay any attention to what she was saying. He
stomped up the back steps and into the house closing the door a
little more firmly behind him than was strictly necessary.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everything
all right, dear?" asked Mrs Weasley. Harry just nodded and edged
out of the kitchen silently, taking the stairs two at a time until
he reached Ron's room and flopped down on his bed.</p><p class="calibre8">He
heard Ron, Ginny and George enter the kitchen noisily a short while
later, the din carried through the house and up to the little room
under the attic. Suddenly all noise ceased and then Harry heard the
tread of one set of footsteps on the stairs. There was a knock at the
door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?"
Harry sighed, debating whether or not to let Mrs Weasley in. It
wasn't a long debate and he got up and opened the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"May
I come in dear?" she asked him and he just nodded as she took a few
steps inside before he closed the door behind her and sat heavily on
his bed. Mrs Weasley didn't beat about the bush.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
bothering you Harry?" He shrugged. Mrs Weasley continued. "Ron
doesn't mean to interfere, you know. He was upset when you and
Ginny broke up last summer."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
so was I," muttered Harry as he stared out of the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know they tease her," Mrs Weasley sighed. "But really, to them,
only you have ever been good enough for Ginny. Ron worries you'll
break up with her again. He covers it up by pretending he doesn't
want to know you two are even going out. For the other boys it's
just teasing, but Ron's scared."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know he doesn't want me to hurt Ginny," said Harry. "But why's
he so scared? It wouldn't mean anything to him in the long run
would it? Ginny and I are the ones who'd have to deal with it."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
happened when you broke up with Cho?" Mrs Weasely enquired. "What
about Ron and Lavender?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Merlin,
you heard about Lavender too?" shuddered Harry. He looked up. Mrs
Weasley didn't look at all <em class="calibre9">pleased</em>
to have heard about Lavender and Harry couldn't stop the grin
forming on his face before he frowned. "Cho and I couldn't even
look at each other after we broke up. I don't think Ron can look at
Lavender now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that's what Ron's afraid of," said Mrs Weasley. "If you and
Ginny end up so you can't even look at each other, he's worried
he'll get stuck in the middle. He's not dealing with it very
effectively of course. If he keeps going the way he is he'll
ostracise the both of you anyway. I've seen the way he looks at you
two before he remembers to be outraged. There's a look that steals
over his face at first when he sees you two whispering to each other
or when you hold her hand or she kisses your cheek. He loves watching
you two love each other." Harry started, staring at Mrs Weasley in
surprise. She leaned over and patted him on the knee.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
just scared of losing you if you break up badly. Ginny reacts because
she doesn't understand why Ron can't be happy for her and for
you. Ron wants you to love her the way she's always loved you, he's
scared of what will happen if you do though," Mrs Weasley paused
while Harry blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
too late. I already love her," whispered Harry. Mrs Weasley smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think deep down, he knows that. He's still trying to learn how to
share you with someone besides Hermione. They'll sort it out. Now
come down and have a spot of tea," she finished as she rose and
headed for the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
said Harry softly as she opened the door and Mrs Weasley turned and
smiled at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
worries dear, now come on, I made scones," she said as she hurried
back down the crooked staircase. Harry leapt off the bed and bounded
down the stairs after her.</p><p class="calibre8">As
he entered the kitchen Ron and Ginny both looked up from the cups of
tea they were stirring endlessly. George was leaning against a
sideboard munching on a scone. He looked as though he was waiting to
watch a much touted Quidditch match. Harry wordlessly took the cup of
tea Mrs Weasley thrust at him and sat down.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
mate…" began Ron before he trailed off. Ginny sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
he means to say is sorry," she said quietly. "We're both sorry,
aren't we Ron?" Perhaps she stepped on his foot or kicked him
under the table because Ron suddenly winced and nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I'm sorry I just, well…" Ron stopped and ran a hand haphazardly
through his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"
'Sokay Ron, doesn't matter," interrupted
Harry. "I shouldn't have lost my temper, sorry."</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
started Ron fiercely, "you shouldn't be apologising! I was the
one who acted like a great big ar– "</p><p class="calibre8">"Ronald!"
warned Mrs Weasley. Ginny giggled and Ron blushed. Harry found it
hard to hide a smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
I was a bit unfair, have been for the past couple of weeks. Reckon I
could be a bit more mature about things, you know? 'Sides, 'snot
like Hermione and I – er, well so anyway I'll keep my opinions,
you know, to myself or something," said Ron. His face softened and
he looked at the table. "I like that you two are together. I don't
want you to stop … you know, but, well, seems I can't help
blowing things out of proportion inside my head and imaging the
worst." Ron shrugged helplessly as a blush crept up his neck and
onto his cheeks and Ginny threw her arms around him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Ron, you're so sweet!" she sniffed. George threw down his scone
and launched himself at them wailing theatrically about sibling love
and ickle Ronnikins and how the babies were growing up right before
his very eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Geroffame!
Gerroff!" mumbled Ron from his place at the bottom of the pile of
Weasleys now on the kitchen floor. "Harry, help!" For his part
Harry just grinned until George reached out and pulled Harry off his
chair into the pile of tangled limbs on the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
and feel the love, Harry!" They were still trying to untangle
themselves when the back door creaked open. Charlie shook his head as
he stepped over them and snatched a scone off the plate in the middle
of the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
old are you lot?" he asked rhetorically as he surveyed the four of
them laughing helplessly on the floor. It seemed that was the moment
for homecomings as a few minutes later Bill and Fleur burst through
the door, Fleur giggling outrageously. Bill shook his head at the
tangled bunch on the floor and he and Fleur made for the stairs. They
seemed a little breathless and flustered when Mrs Weasley began to
ask them about their day. They were clearly trying to exit the room
with exceeding haste. Harry stifled a snort with a great deal of
difficulty as George murmured that Bill and Fleur clearly had certain
activities on their mind and their mother was definitely cooling
their ardour.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
woman gave birth to <em class="calibre9">seven</em>
children. How can she not see what they are thinking? I've <em class="calibre9">seen</em>
the way she looks at dad too," George whispered with a shudder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
are you going to rescue them then?" muttered Charlie and he stooped
down to help George up and hide the smirk now gracing his features.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
way!" exclaimed George softly. "This way is so much more fun!"
Charlie extended a hand to Ron and then Harry while George pulled
Ginny to her feet and the five of them sat down in a row at the
kitchen table watching Mrs Weasley chat aimlessly to the young
married couple as they fidgeted and tried to edge to the hallway and
the staircase beyond.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
it's time they went home," whispered Charlie. "It must be
killing them!"</p><p class="calibre8">"They
forgot the silencing charm last night," muttered George in an
undertone, "home time indeed." Harry noticed that Bill was now
glaring at his younger siblings. Mrs Weasley had succeeded in
dragging Fleur into the small scullery off the kitchen and Bill stood
with his arms crossed and a very grumpy look on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny!
Can you come in here a moment? We need to get the vegetables for
dinner started." Ginny pulled a face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
I'm a girl, yay. I get to help cook," she scowled. Harry smiled
at her sympathetically before she flounced off into the scullery.
Harry wondered briefly why Mrs Weasley was considering starting the
vegetables when he could distinctly smell a delicious stew simmering
in the cauldron on the stove. Then Bill advanced on them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
a lot!" he hissed. "I know very well that you lot knew perfectly
well what was going on there, could you not give a bloke a hand?"
Charlie tilted his head to the side, studying Bill carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nope!"
he said cheerfully. "Why should <em class="calibre9">I</em>
assist <em class="calibre9">you</em>
in obtaining that sort of goal if I myself have no opportunity for
the same?" George nodded sagely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Besides
that was punishment for your forgetfulness last night," he said.
Bill sat down heavily at the table and groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
forgot the silencing charm?" George and Charlie nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Trapped
in a room with your brothers it's the last thing you need to hear
coming from the next room, mate," Charlie informed him with a
shudder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you two hear it as well?" Bill sighed, looking at Ron and Harry who
shook their heads mutely. Harry felt his face heating up listening to
a casual conversation about intimate matters. Mrs Weasley, Fleur and
Ginny emerged from the scullery looking decidedly flushed and not
actually carrying any vegetables out of the tiny room. The back door
creaked open and Percy entered the kitchen with his father.</p><p class="calibre8">"Beel,
I zink zat per'aps we shall be going 'ome tomorrow, after ze
Ceremony, non?" said Fleur.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
well if you are going to forget silencing charms, that probably is
best," Percy said, hanging up his lightweight cloak by the kitchen
door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy!"
his mother hissed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
now, are we not all adults here? We should be able to discuss these
things in a frank and open manner," insisted Percy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny
is not yet an adult," Mrs Weasley asserted. "There is a time and
a place and, well … certain company, in which to discuss these
things!" Ginny rolled her eyes behind her mother's back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
and I wish it wasn't in mine," said Harry out the side of his
mouth to Ron. "At the Dursleys they were still telling Dudley that
babies came from the Cabbage Patch. I think they thought he still
believed them! There was never a frank and open discussion about
anything other than how much trouble I was."</p><p class="calibre8">To
Harry's relief the conversation went no further as at that moment
Hermione flew in her face flushed and eyes sparkling with excitement.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
found them!" she burst out. "I found them! I put a message in all
the papers and I found them! They're in Yackandandah!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yackkawhere?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yackandandah!
It's about twenty minutes from Wodonga, in Victoria's goldfields
but they needed dentists and my parents went there!" said Hermione
excitedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wodowhat?
They've got Galleons sitting around in the fields down there?
Haven't they ever heard of a bank?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Ron, stop being silly," said Hermione, bestowing a beatific smile
on him as she slid into a seat next to Harry at the kitchen table. It
seemed nothing could dampen her mood right now. "Yackandandah is an
Indigenous word describing the town and Wodonga is the nearest
regional centre. It's on the river that borders Victoria and New
South Wales and Wodonga means bulrushes. Goldfields are areas where
they mine for gold."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,
I have absolutely no idea what any of that means. You know that don't
you?" said Ron and Hermione nodded feverishly. "But you have been
reading books again, haven't you?" Hermione slapped him on the
arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Actually
Ronald, I've been learning all about the internet and emailing on
the computer. The librarian showed me all about it and I set up an
email and the letters just appear in there and everything but it does
research Ron! It's like having thousands of books in one computer!"
Hermione was positively glowing and no one had any idea what she was
talking about, although Harry did have a head start as he did know
what a computer was at least.</p><p class="calibre8">"Muggles,"
Mr Weasley said shaking his head as he sat down, "it's amazing
the things they come up with."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you know where they are now dear, that's wonderful," said Mrs
Weasley from the stove where she was stirring a positively massive
cauldron full of delicious smelling stew.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did you tell them to get them to respond?" asked Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
said in the personal ad that it was in relation to an inheritance
matter," Hermione blushed. "It's sort of true … some people
think children are an inheritance … of sorts … I didn't do
anything underhand or wrong and well, they won't care when they get
their memories back will they?"</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you've found them, you've submitted your paperwork and you've
figured out how to reverse the memory charm then?" enquired Bill.
Hermione shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've
found them, I've submitted paperwork but I haven't figured out
how I'll go about the reversal yet. It was next on my list."</p><p class="calibre8">"When
are you going?" asked Ron softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know. The paperwork could take another month or even two,
then I have to organise funds and book portkeys and things,"
Hermione admitted. "As soon as possible; I want to go as soon as
possible, Ron." Ron turned to Harry, his eyes pleading.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
you help me submit the paperwork, Hermione?" Harry asked slowly. "I
want mine to be ready when yours is." Harry almost felt Ron sag in
relief and Hermione's eyes shone with unshed tears as she threw her
arms around his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hang
on," said George sharply. "Why aren't <em class="calibre9">you</em>
going with her Ron?" Ron shifted uncomfortably and rubbed the back
of his neck looking at the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
it money?" demanded George. "Because if it's that I'll –"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
it's not that," interrupted Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
then why is Harry going? Why is he leaving Ginny again when
Hermione's <em class="calibre9">your</em>
bird?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
am not a bird!" huffed Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
you know what I mean, Hermione!" snapped George. "It's
affectionate and all that guff, you tell me why Harry's going and
not him?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really
George," said Ginny timidly, "it's okay. We all talked about
it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
not with me you didn't!"</p><p class="calibre8">"And
what's it got to do with you anyway?" demanded Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everything
if the reason is me!" The four of them shuffled their feet and
looked anywhere but at George. George stood up and began shouting.</p><p class="calibre8">"They,"
he indicated Harry and Ginny, "have been apart for a <em class="calibre9">year</em>
and you want him to go running off to look after the woman that <em class="calibre9">you</em>
are supposed to love, and be apart again? Why? Is it because of me?
<em class="calibre9">Is it because of me</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
told you I wouldn't leave you alone, George, and I'm not going
to. Yeah we all talked about it because we're the ones who are
going to have to live with the decision and miss each other like
crazy. We're adults, George. We can make our own decisions. We have
been all year," Ron was trying desperately to keep his voice down
and failing miserably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny
is not an adult," spat George.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do wish people would stop saying that," the girl in question
muttered. "It's only fifty two days until I am."</p><p class="calibre8">"Counting
Gin?" smirked Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
much."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't like the idea of either of you running off to Australia
dears," said Mrs Weasley. "Perhaps you could leave it to the
Ministry, I am sure they'd be able to take care of it. What sort of
things could happen to you in that place? We don't even know if
you'll be safe!" She started to tremble and Fleur took her wand
and sat her down in the nearest chair. Harry and Hermione looked
guiltily at each other. They had definitely not meant to cause all of
this.</p><p class="calibre8">George
and Ron started up their argument again, Mrs Weasley continued to
wring her hands and Harry and Hermione were at a total loss. It was
Bill who managed to restore order.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,
it strikes me that you may need a little help when you get there.
Curse breakers are very useful types of people to have around when
reversing spells, jinxes and curses … or memory charms. Fleur and I
never did get a honeymoon and Australia sounds like a delightful
place. We could spend some time there after packing you and your
parents back home," said Bill thoughtfully. "How about it Fleur?"
Harry rather though Fleur agreed given the way she flew at her
husband squealing and kissing him full on the mouth – something he
was happy to reciprocate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Still
doesn't solve the fact that Ron should be with her," insisted
George. Fleur waved her hand airily as she surfaced from the
passionate kiss she had bestowed upon her husband.</p><p class="calibre8">"Zo,
'e shall come too, non? Eef money ees not a problem as you zay, zen
'e can come too."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not leaving George," stated Ron, immovable.</p><p class="calibre8">"Zo,
breeng 'im wiz you, I do not care. We shall 'ave more zan one
room, oui mon amour?" Harry swore she began to purr at Bill. "I
am sure zat a 'oliday in zee country weel do 'im some good. Eet
weel do me some good." She was definitely purring.</p><p class="calibre8">"There,
that's settled then," said Mrs Weasley briskly. "Let's get
this table sorted for dinner."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry
should still go," Ginny said quietly. He looked at her in surprise
and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
Ron and George and Bill <em class="calibre9">and</em>
Fleur are all there, they don't need me to go too!" he exclaimed.
"I want to stay with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
like Fleur said, it would be a wonderful holiday and honestly who
most needs a holiday in this room?" Ginny was sounding fairly sure
but Harry could see her hands trembling and the unshed tears
collecting in the corners of her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
want to stay with you," repeated Harry. "If I don't need to go
away from you I'm not going to, ever again. I know I told Hermione
I'd help her bring her mum and dad home but Hermione understands."
Hermione nodded emphatically. Harry reached out to hold Ginny's
trembling hands in his. "I don't need a holiday if I'm with
you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
breeng 'er too," said Fleur, looking up from where she had been
nuzzling Bill's neck. "Zen you can have your 'oliday and Ginny
at ze same time." Ginny shook her head ruefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Now
</em>someone conveniently forgets I'm not
of age," she muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Capital
idea, splendid!" started Mr Weasley. His wife looked at him in
horror.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
cannot be serious, Arthur! Letting Ginny go halfway around the world?
I don't think so!" Mr Weasley however was not to be swayed.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
nearly of age, Molly. She'd be with Bill and George and Ron and
they would never let anything happen to her," he stood up and
looked Molly directly in the eye. "She'd be with <em class="calibre9">Harry</em>,
Molly. She couldn't <em class="calibre9">be</em>
any safer. And you'd be doing this for Harry too. He won't leave
her and you tell me he couldn't use some relaxing days in the sun?"
Mrs Weasley turned around to inspect Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
winter in Australia," said Hermione. "I'm not sure there'd be
any sun."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you are looking a bit peaky, dear," Mrs Weasley said as she eyed
Harry critically. "Maybe you should go, do you the world of good."
Harry shook his head. The matter was dropped but there was lingering
tension and Harry couldn't quite put his finger on who it was
between or what it was over, it simply swirled around the room like
mist. As they cleared the table at the end of the meal Mr Weasley
pulled Harry aside.</p><p class="calibre8">"File
your papers, file Ginny's too. Leave Molly to me," said Mr
Weasley quietly. They were all shooed to bed early by a still
unsettled Mrs Weasley who cited the next morning's ceremony as the
reason but somehow they all knew it was so she could have it out with
her husband.</p><p class="calibre8">As
they made their way up to the first landing George got out his wand
and made a production of showing Bill how to cast a silencing charm.
He had the charm cast on his own head for his troubles.</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
heard a ruckus as he made his way down the stairs early the next
morning. He'd woken up early after a fitful night, feeling a
nervousness that a long hot shower had not helped. He had given up
trying to do anything with his hair and headed downstairs despite the
fact that it was still too early for breakfast to be on. It was
shaping up to be a day too warm to be wearing stiff and formal dress
robes and he was feeling generally disgruntled. His previous
positivity towards the Order of Merlin Ceremony had been replaced by
a ball of nervous energy and a pit of anxiety in his stomach. As he
entered the kitchen he discovered Ginny at the centre of the
maelstrom of activity.</p><p class="calibre8">Why
George and Charlie decided to find her Harry Potter storybook and use
it to take the mickey out of her on this particular morning was a
complete and utter mystery. Neither saw Harry as he entered the
kitchen, too intent were they on teasing Ginny. She was jumping
frantically, trying desperately to grab the book that was being
levitated just out of her reach.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
you wait until mum and dad get in here," raged Ginny at Charlie.
"You're only doing this because I can't use magic back at you!
I am so going to get you for this!"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
my prerogative to tease you, squirt," said Charlie. "I'm trying
to get my fill in before I go back to Romania. I know it seems like
I'm picking on you a lot, but really it will all even out."
Charlie waved his wand back and forth and made the book soar through
the air, skimming Ginny's fingertips.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oooooh,
I just wish you'd go away already!" fumed Ginny. "I have had
enough of you, I can't <em class="calibre9">wait</em>
until I am of age!" Charlie laughed. Harry took out his wand, still
unseen by the other three.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Expelliarmus</em>!"
he cried and Charlie's wand flew out of his hand and Harry reached
out to catch it as it spun across the kitchen towards him. The book
fell earthward with sudden speed, landing on Charlie's head,
knocking him off balance and to the floor and Ginny ran to snatch it
up. Charlie looked up at Harry a bizarre mixture of fear and
sheepishness on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
that's why they are giving <em class="calibre9">me</em>
an Order of Merlin," quipped Harry as he helped Charlie to his
feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
always take her side," muttered George. Harry smiled and shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
got more to offer me than you lot," he said as he reached out to
stop Ginny leaving. She was trying to edge backwards to the kitchen
door her hands behind her back, shaking her head as Harry walked
towards her. George snickered. Ginny was bright red.</p><p class="calibre8">"C'mon,
lemme see it," wheedled Harry. Ginny shook her head violently.
Harry tried his best puppy dog look, the one that always worked with
Mrs Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">It
did not work with Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">Unluckily
for her Ron came barreling through the door at that moment, saw what
was behind her back and swiped it from her without her even noticing
he was there.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
ho!" he cried in triumph. "Little Gin-Gin's <em class="calibre9">book</em>!"
Ginny looked to be on the verge of tears.</p><p class="calibre8">"Give
it back to her, Ron," growled Harry, his protective instincts going
into overdrive at the sight of Ginny's distraught face. Ron handed
it back to her solemnly, muttering something under his breath that
sounded suspiciously like 'whipped'. Ginny snatched the book and
ran back up the stairs. Harry shook his head at the three Weasleys in
the kitchen before going after her.</p><p class="calibre8">He
ran into Hermione and Mr and Mrs Weasley on the stairs as he took
them three at a time. They must have seen Ginny race up just before
him because they did not stop to question him and moved aside to let
him pass. He caught sight of the bottom of her robes as she reached
the landing and disappeared into her room, the door slipping quietly
closed behind her. Racing up the last few steps he knocked softly on
her door to no avail.</p><p class="calibre8">"Please,
Ginny, let me in," he pleaded with the smooth wooden door. Percy
came past at that moment and asked Harry rather pointedly if it was
appropriate to be going into Ginny's room. Harry was unsure whether
Percy's commonsense made him drop the subject and hurry down the
stairs or if it was the look on his face and raised wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't care about the book. I won't look at it. I just want to
make sure you're okay. Please, let me in," Harry pleaded. He
leaned his forehead on the door. "Don't shut me out." Harry
could hear the faint sounds of Hermione and Mrs Weasley remonstrating
with Charlie, George and Ron downstairs. Slowly Ginny's bedroom
door creaked open, her brown eyes peering out at him like they had
that first morning he'd come to The Burrow. Her eyes were red
rimmed and Harry reached out a hand to stroke her cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
I come in?" he whispered. Ginny moved away from the door and Harry
pushed it open and slipped inside. Ginny had her back to him and
Harry closed the door quietly before putting his arms around her. As
he noticed the book tossed haphazardly on her bed she turned around
in his embrace and began quietly crying into his shirt. This was not
the Ginny he was used to. The Ginny he was used to rarely cried and
definitely didn't cry over teasing of the familial variety. He
patted her back awkwardly and had absolutely no idea what to do or
say.</p><p class="calibre8">Suddenly
Ginny pulled away and turned to fiddle with her hairbrush. Harry kept
silent, hands in his pockets as he waited for her to speak.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
should have been Fred," she suddenly whispered, staring out of the
window. "I don't care if they tease me, not really. It's a
little embarrassing…" She waved vaguely at the book on her bed
which Harry could see had a heart drawn around his name.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
be," Harry said softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
the thing that hurts the most is that it was Charlie," Ginny
admitted. "It's so stupid. Here they are threatening to expose my
silly childhood fantasies, to <em class="calibre9">you</em>
and I'm crying because it was Charlie teasing me and not Fred! I
just miss him, you know. If things were right, if it was normal it
would have been Fred and George, not Charlie and George." She
finished in a whisper, turning around as a lone tear rolled down her
cheek. Harry just held her in his arms and let her cry.</p><p class="calibre8">A
short time later they both descended the stairs, the book in hand for
Hermione who had wanted to see it. George and Charlie were sitting at
the table, subdued and Ron was trying to get Hermione to talk to him.
Harry handed Hermione the Harry Potter storybook. She squealed in
delight and immediately opened the book and buried her head in it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hang
on!" exclaimed Charlie. "It didn't look like that before!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
I fixed it," replied Harry airily. He had embellished the heart a
nine year old Ginny Weasley had drawn around his name on the cover,
adding '<em class="calibre9">HP 4 GW'</em>
inside it and giving the drawing of a very young Harry on the front a
thought bubble that said '<em class="calibre9">Ginny
Weasley is my Chosen One, I just don't know it yet'</em>.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
shook his head and Hermione, taking a look at the cover gave Harry a
long winded lecture about the care of books and how one does <em class="calibre9">not</em>
write on them, thank you very much! Harry just smiled and reached for
Ginny's hand under the table, eating one handed as he entwined his
fingers with hers.</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
felt a certain sense of trepidation as he Flooed into the Ministry
Atrium. Kingsley had reopened the Apparition points at the Ministry
so that people could attend the Ceremony but had connected The Burrow
up to the fireplaces in the Atrium. He assured Harry that it was to
offer him a measure of security because they could control that area
but Harry wondered rather privately if it was because he hadn't
actually got an Apparition licence. Everyone had seemed willing to
let him Apparate in until Hermione helpfully pointed out that he
didn't have a licence. The Burrow had been connected to the
Ministry within the hour.</p><p class="calibre8">As
he tumbled out of the fireplace Harry noticed that the dreary
darkness which had overtaken the Atrium during the past year had
lifted. It was deserted which he found unusual but certainly not
bothersome and the dark floors once again shone, the peacock blue
ceiling with its roving gilt shapes seemed to be more vibrant than
ever and the dreadful statue that had dominated the Atrium last time
he had been there was gone. In its place was a raised dais. Harry
contemplated what it might be for, trying to ignore the rotund
security wizard who was standing three feet away, staring at him. Mr
Weasley had Flooed in behind him. The rest of the family began
exiting the fireplace one by one.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
temporary, for the Ceremony today," Mr Weasley explained. They are
going to put a fountain there again, when someone gets around to
designing one." Harry nodded and, having had enough of being stared
at, strode over to the security wizard and stuck his hand out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello!
Harry Potter. Nice to meet you," he said. "And you are?" The
wizard offered a pudgy hand rather mechanically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
S-s-salisbury S-stoke," the little round man stammered. Harry shook
the man's hand with apparent enthusiasm and then lowered his voice
to a conspiratorial whisper.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't suppose you could tell me who's supposed to be meeting me
and taking me to see the Minister, could you?" Clearly it was
Salisbury's job because he abruptly came to his senses and rather
officiously nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course, of course, this way Mr Potter," and Salisbury Stoke led
Harry into a lift, the Weasleys and Hermione crowding in after him.
They soon found themselves in Kingsley's office and Mr Stoke
scurried away, looking back over his shoulder a couple of times as if
he still couldn't quite believe he had seen Harry Potter, in the
flesh. George only stopped ribbing Harry about not giving the poor
man an autograph when Harry promised to autograph George's forehead
with everlasting ink.</p><p class="calibre8">Kingsley
greeted them and began to explain the Ceremony that would take place
that morning. It was going to be short and sweet; just an hour,
broadcast on the WWN, with a press reception afterwards; the
questions had already been submitted and approved by Kingsley,
followed by lunch. Then he could simply go home.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kingsley,
you are the best Minister of Magic in the History of, well, magic,"
said Harry. "Not too long, not too fussy, brilliant!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Mr
Potter, you forget I have come to know you fairly well and pomp and
ceremony are definitely not your thing," returned Kingsley.</p><p class="calibre8">"Understatement,"
coughed Ron behind his hand. Hermione elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Say,
Kingsley, you don't think there's anyone about who can do my
Apparition test?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">It
turned out there was someone who could, and in the short time they
had before the Ceremony was to start, a rather starstruck witch
tested Harry on his Apparition and issued his licence. Then the
Weasleys returned to the Atrium while Harry went with Kingsley to
stand on the dais in the now crowded Atrium, the assembled witches
and wizards falling absolutely silent as they joined several witches
and wizards on the dais.</p><p class="calibre8">There
was a sudden cacophony of sound as the crowd in the Atrium began
cheering when they saw Harry, delaying the start of the Ceremony for
a good ten minutes. A few official looking people began to give
speeches about the new direction of the Ministry, the future and the
incomparable sacrifice that those who had lost their lives had made.
Harry watched as the sea of brightly robed witches and wizards
cheered and clapped each brief speaker but he wasn't yet eighteen
and, quite frankly, stuffy middle aged men and women delivering
speeches about an event in which they had not taken part was not only
boring for an active young mind but Harry found it just a little
hypocritical. He found his mind wandering and he began to search the
crowd for faces that he knew in order to pass the time.</p><p class="calibre8">There
was a knot of Weasleys close to the edge of the dais. Mr and Mrs
Weasley looked up at him, wearing expressions that made them look for
all the world like they were his proud parents. Harry reflected that
for all intents and purposes they were and he had never felt so
blessed to have had them in his life. Harry gave them a little wave
and Mrs Weasley beamed wider. Charlie was conjuring what looked like
a sign and trying to pin it surreptitiously to Percy's back as the
latter stood stiffly, his back ramrod straight, attention riveted on
the speakers. Harry was not surprised to see Penelope Clearwater had
joined them, her arm hooked through Percy's. Bill was standing
behind Fleur, his arms around her. Harry was not at all certain they
were listening as they seemed to be swaying slightly and wearing
dreamy expressions. Not seeing George, Ginny, Ron or Hermione he
began to search the crowd for them.</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Figg was there, still in her carpet slippers but clearly wearing her
best housecoat. Harry idly wondered where the Dursleys were right now
and decided that although he did not care he should at least find
out. Dudley had been decent enough the last time they saw each other
after all. His eyes still roving, Harry spotted Xenophilious Lovegood
in burnt orange robes waving his arms in the air in a complex pattern
that Harry was sure he once seen Luna do when waffling about
Wrackspurts. He couldn't see Luna, however. He kept looking,
spotting various members of the Order of the Phoenix and a few people
he thought worked at the Ministry. Hagrid was waving to him from the
furthest corner and Harry waved back. Auntie Muriel and her enormous
pink feathered hat were next to Neville's grandmother. Mrs
Longbottom's vulture hat looked as though it could eat Muriel's
feather concoction for dinner. Still Harry failed to find any of his
friends; Neville was nowhere near his grandmother.</p><p class="calibre8">Frowning
slightly and wondering why those who were closest to him had decided
to either not come or wander off and not pay attention Harry spotted
Andromeda with little Teddy and standing slightly behind her, Viktor
Krum. Maybe it was a good thing Ron had apparently vanished. Forcing
his attention back to the speakers, and vowing to have words with his
friends for abandoning him, Harry caught the tail end of Kingsley's
speech.</p><p class="calibre8">"
–and so it is not only one man who effected the
future we all now look forward to, welcome the members of
Dumbledore's Army without whom we would not be celebrating this
victory today!" Harry spun around to see Ron and Hermione, grinning
broadly and leading a group of young witches and wizards whom Harry
knew intimately onto the dais. His jaw fell open.</p><p class="calibre8">"Brilliant!"
he breathed at Kingsley who just smiled and handed him a medal that
Harry saw was an Order of Merlin, Second Class, with Ron's name on
it. He looked at Kingsley questioningly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Haven't
been listening, have you Potter?" muttered Kingsley out the side of
his mouth. Harry blushed. Kingsley turned to address the assembled
crowd who were cheering and clapping as the members of Dumbledore's
Army filed onto the stage. "Mr Potter will now address us before he
presents these fine young people with their medals."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
gulped. He caught Ron's eye and noticed he was trying not to laugh
at the look on Harry's face, which, if the way Harry was feeling
was anything to go by, was probably a look of sheer panic. Hermione
was trying to look encouraging and nodding at him. Behind them stood
Neville who looked pleased and proud, Luna who looked just a little
bit vague and Ginny who was smiling that same radiant smile she had
bestowed on him in the Room of Requirement as she climbed through the
portrait hole followed by Fred and George and Lee. As his eyes roamed
over the group assembled behind them he remembered that these were
the people who had first trusted him, first believed him. These were
the people who had first shown faith in him as he taught them how to
defend themselves in a room at the top of Hogwarts. His eyes came to
rest on George and Harry heard Fred in the Room of Requirement that
night, defending Dumbledore's Army to his mother and Harry knew
just what to say.</p><p class="calibre8">"There
were some people who didn't think we were serious. Some people
thought we were just a group of children, a teenager's gang,
playing about," he said to the assembled crowd who had fallen
silent when he began to speak. "But these are the bravest people I
know. They were the people who first believed in me. Without Ron and
Hermione I wouldn't even be here, they've been my best friends,
my lifeline. Without Neville and Ginny and Luna this past year we'd
never have held it together long enough to defeat Voldemort-" Harry
rolled his eyes at the audible gasp that went up.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
couldn't have done it without you. It's taken me a while to
figure this out but I don't have to do everything alone," said
Harry as he turned to address his friends. Hermione sniffed but
smiled at him as a tear rolled down her cheek. Harry turned back to
the audience. "We may have been a teenager's gang but we dared,
we dared to take on Voldemort and we won. This group of teenagers,
this gang, was the first to turn up, to dare." A cheer went up as
Harry finished and turned to hand the medal in his hand to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">Kingsley
Shacklebolt read out the names of Dumbldore's Army starting with
Ron and Hermione then reading out Neville and Luna and Ginny. Harry
handed each one of them a medal and gave them a hug. He was sure that
the kiss he gave Ginny on the cheek was noticed by at least one
person as he heard George wolf whistle as he did so. Harry realised
he didn't have to pretend anymore and before she left his embrace
he lowered his head and gave her a lingering kiss on the lips. Seamus
and Dean joined in the wolf whistling and more than one camera flash
went off but Harry didn't care. At that moment, standing with those
friends and family most dear to him he felt like the happiness had
finally come.</p><p class="calibre8">He
released Ginny, who was blushing to the roots of her hair, and as
Kingsley went alphabetically through the members of Dumbledore's
Army he handed each one a medal. He hugged Hannah Abbott, Lavender
Brown, Katie Bell and Susan Bones before shaking the hands of Terry
Boot, Cho Chang and Michael Corner. Cho looked a little disappointed
but Harry was too busy looking at Dennis's sad face as Kingsley
read out Colin's posthumous award. Harry took the medal gingerly
and looked at the name engraved on it, tracing it with his finger.</p><p class="calibre8">"Make
him proud," he whispered as he hugged Dennis, handing him Colin's
Order of Merlin and then his own. Dennis managed a watery smile as
he moved to stand with the others where Neville waited to comfort
him. Justin Finch-Fletchley, Seamus Finnigan and Anthony Goldstein
might have only got handshakes but after Angelina got a hug Lee
Jordan moved in for one as well and laughing, Harry complied. Pompous
Ernie Macmillan and the Patil twins were followed by Zacharias Smith,
Alicia Spinnet and Dean Thomas. And then only George was left and two
medals were still in the little box Kingsley held.</p><p class="calibre8">His
eyes swimming with tears Harry took them both and as Kingsley read
out Fred Weasley and then George Weasley he handed them to George who
stared at them for a long moment before Harry reached out and
embraced him. George hugged him back and as he pulled away, wiping
his cheeks he grinned at Harry and said,</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
you even think of snogging <em class="calibre9">me</em>
Potter!" The assembled group of young witches and wizards burst out
laughing as they all gathered around Harry for one enormous group hug
and it was with some difficulty that Kingsley managed to extricate
Harry in order to receive his own medal, an Order of Merlin First
Class.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you, Harry," said Kingsley, his voice low and rumbly. "We are in
your debt." Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then
your repayment is to live, to rebuild your lives and keep going,"
he said and the crowd cheered as he posed with Dumbledore's Army
for several cameras.</p><p class="calibre8">The
press conference was over quickly with straightforward questions
about what he was going to do now, if he supported the current
Minister of Magic becoming permanent and if he was going to try out
for Professional Quidditch. Lunch was a rowdy, enjoyable affair with
the Weasleys, most of the Order including Hagrid and Professor
McGonagall, and Dumbledore's Army. Before they were seated Mrs
Weasley scolded him for his extremely public display of affection but
Harry could tell she didn't really mean it. Behind her back Charlie
gave him two thumbs up and Mr Weasley winked at him making Harry
blush as heavily as Ginny had earlier.</p><p class="calibre8">No
one wanted to leave the Banquet Room that they had repaired to for
lunch after the meal itself was over. Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle
informed Harry, when he asked, that Vernon, Petunia and Dudley had
returned home after Number Four Privet Drive had been rebuilt by
magical means and were as well as could be expected. This meant that
Vernon was still ungrateful, Petunia was still thin lipped and
nervous and Dudley was asking if Harry was really all right. After
consoling an emotional Hagrid and being swept up by several Order
members for pats on the back and handshakes Harry snuck away from the
crowd and, pulling Ginny with him, found a secluded spot that was
largely obscured by a massive potted fern.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
there, Ginny," he asked as he pulled her close. "How come you
guys didn't tell me about the medals?" Ginny grinned up at him,
her red hair framed her face like fire and her eyes sparkled.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
wanted to surprise you. Kingsley asked us what we thought and we told
him you'd hate to be singled out so he spoke to Neville and Luna
and he figured you'd want the DA to be recognised," she said.
"That day you asked him about the Ceremony, the day that newspaper
article came out, he was going to tell you but you were so confident
when you spoke about it that we decided to keep it a secret and
surprise you."</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was a lovely surprise," whispered Harry and he dropped his lips to
hers, their bodies melding together seamlessly as they stood behind
the massive fern.</p><p class="calibre8">That
was where Bill found them twenty minutes later, their lips still
caressing each other's, Ginny's hands in his hair and his hands
stroking her back. A discreet cough broke them apart.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum's
looking for you two," he said, grinning. "Be glad <em class="calibre9">I</em>
found you. Dad'll have no chance of convincing her to let Ginny go
anywhere with you, much less Australia, if she ever catches a look at
that!" Blushing, Ginny and Harry straightened themselves out and
tamed their hair before stepping out from behind the fern. Privately
Harry doubted anything they had done to fix themselves up was going
to fool Mrs Weasley because Ginny's lips were still swollen and she
had a languid wanton air about her that he was sure no one could
miss. He found himself unable to keep his hands off her and they
wandered the room searching for her mother with arms around each
other, Ginny stealing glances at Harry when he periodically kissed
her cheek or hair.</p><p class="calibre8">They
found Mrs Weasley and she did look at them with eyebrows raised.
Harry looked suitably sheepish but Ginny just looked back at her
imperiously and finally Mrs Weasley smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
heading off now, your father and I," she said. "Can't keep up
with you young ones." She smiled wistfully as she watched Neville
and George, ably assisted by Lee and Dean, balancing several glasses
in a pyramid on a nearby table. Seamus was waiting with a bottle of
butterbeer to create a frothy fountain that filled all the glasses
when the pyramid was finished.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll
see you at home, then," she suddenly sniffed and launched herself
at Harry, enfolding him in a rib cracking hug. "We're so proud of
you, dear. Look after my baby." And before Harry could hug her back
she was gone, threading her way through the crowd to where Mr Weasley
was waiting at the door.</p><p class="calibre8">It
was quite some time later, after treating Ginny to his newly licensed
skill of Apparition by taking her Side-Along, that Harry and Ginny
stumbled through the back door of The Burrow with Ron and Hermione at
their heels laughing and having had just a little too much
Butterbeer.</p><p class="calibre8">They
stumbled into chaos.</p>
