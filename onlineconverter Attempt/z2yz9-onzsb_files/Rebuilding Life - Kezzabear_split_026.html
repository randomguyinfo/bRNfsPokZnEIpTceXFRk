			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">26.
Return</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The Prefect
compartment was full of squashy chintz covered chairs and ancient
wingbacks covered in velvet. Harry was lounging in an overstuffed
armchair and staring idly out the window at the passing scenery as
Hermione droned on, her wand waving wildly and her parchment rustling
constantly. He had tried staring at things inside the compartment but
he kept catching either the eye of the awed fifth year Hufflepuffs or
Ginny. The fifth years would giggle and look away quickly while Ginny
would pull a face at him. Harry found himself either turning an
embarrassing red or suppressing the urge to burst out laughing. He
dreaded looking at any of the other students.</p><p class="calibre8">He'd attempted to
look friendly and welcoming at first but his resolve crumbled as he
watched Romilda Vane boring holes in the back of Ginny's head and a
fifth year Gryffindor girl he didn't know gazing at him with
adoration. Additionally, the disgusting display by one of Slytherin's
sixth year Prefects and Draco Malfoy was enough to make his stomach
turn. And so Harry gazed out the window while Hermione delivered her
lecture on the importance they would be to the reestablishment of
learning in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre8">"Isn't that
right, Harry?" Harry jumped, startled. Hermione was looking at him
with an air of superiority as if she knew he had not been listening.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course you're
right Hermione," Harry smiled. "Isn't she Romilda? Tell the
rest of us what you liked about Hermione's little presentation."
Romilda blanched and stammered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er, well I liked
the… um, part where she said how it was like … our job to guide
all the… um, new people and sort of help them out." By the time
she finished Romilda was bright red.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, that part
was really great Hermione," added Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Granger, I know
you're eager but really, a number of us have been Prefects
already," drawled Malfoy, not bothering to sit up from the position
he was in, half sprawled in the lap of the sixth year Prefect. "I
think we know what we are doing. In fact I, as you know, have already
been <em class="calibre9">Head Boy</em> so I am sure I don't need <em class="calibre9">your</em> help
with anything."</p><p class="calibre8">There was a
momentary silence as every single pair of eyes in the carriage
flicked from Malfoy to Harry and back again. Harry leant back in his
armchair and propped his feet up on a nearby pouf.</p><p class="calibre8">"Excellent
Malfoy," he said. "You can take all the new Prefects and go and
do that patrol thing I've heard so much about. After all, they will
want the expert to show them how it's done." He stared at Malfoy,
arms crossed over his chest, while Draco opened and closed his mouth
like a fish.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll help you
Draco," simpered the girl he'd recently been draped over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fabulous," said
Harry brightly. "Off you trot then. Take Orla and Stewart here with
you." The two Ravenclaw fifth years stared at Harry in horror but
he smiled at them reassuringly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … er …"
Orla Quirke trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Draco, here, is
going to be helpful," insisted Harry. "Because being helpful is
what Hermione's been telling us, hasn't she?" The two
Ravenclaws glanced at Luna as they stood up and followed a
disgruntled Malfoy out of the compartment, the unknown Slytherin
Prefect hanging onto his arm and his every word.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't think
you were listening, Harry," Hermione hissed at Harry as the door
slid shut on them.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wasn't,"
Harry smiled back as he unfolded himself and stood up. "Ron got me
your notes so I could know what you were on about without worrying if
I fell asleep or got distracted. I've been reading them every night
for a week." Hermione looked at him, her eyes glittering
suspiciously before she suddenly launched herself at him. Harry
staggered back a step and nearly fell into his armchair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh! You <em class="calibre9">studied</em>!"
she cried. Then she burst into tears. "And Ron helped you cheat! I
miss him so much!" Harry looked helplessly over the top of her head
at Ginny and Neville as Hermione sobbed into his shoulder. Ginny was
frantically miming that he should put his arms around her and Neville
was shaking his head sorrowfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"She awfully
emotional," said Luna. "I do hope the Flurgumbles haven't
gotten to her. It would be such a shame." Harry rolled his eyes and
put his arms around Hermione, patting her on the back a little more
skilfully than he had a few months ago.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, um, here …
you can all go now and, um… just patrol the train every once in a
while," said Ginny gesturing at the rest of the Prefects still
scattered around the compartment.</p><p class="calibre8">"We got a schedule
before …" began a skinny Hufflepuff with a shock of blond hair
and piercing blue eyes whom Harry did not recognise.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah well this
year is … different," supplied Neville hastily. "Just make sure
you do a little patrol every now and then."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who is he
anyway?" whispered a small, dark-haired Slytherin as the younger
students filed out of the compartment and into the corridor. Dennis
Creevey looked sideways at the other boy.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's Neville
Longbottom," he said in a long suffering tone as if the boy should
have known. The dark little Slytherin gaped as Romilda pushed him
through the door.</p><p class="calibre8">'Really?" Harry
heard him ask excitedly as he left. "Neville <em class="calibre9">Longbottom</em>? My
mum says he's a hero, that's what she says …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hear that
Neville?" teased Ginny as she closed the door after the other
students. "You're a <em class="calibre9">hero</em>." Neville sighed as he plopped
down in a nearby armchair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well, being
a hero is not all it's cracked up to be," he complained. "Gran
and I got accosted twice in Madam Malkin's and four times in
Flourish and Blotts last week. I had to duck into Quality Quidditch
Supplies to get away from this one girl …" Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron loves it,"
he said. "He spent half an hour signing autographs in front of the
Menagerie last Thursday. George went down to yell at him because we
were swamped but it didn't dampen Ron's enthusiasm. I think he's
the only one who likes it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well Ronald
always has been a little different," said Luna serenely as she
turned the page of her Quibbler. Hermione sniffed and straightened
up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry, Harry,"
she mumbled, awkwardly straightening his robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry
about it Hermione," Harry insisted. Hermione sat heavily in his
chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just so …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Wrong,"
supplied Ginny as she waved her wand furiously at a nearby wing-back
with a threadbare red velvet cover. The chair shuddered a little and
then stayed still. Ginny stabbed her wand viciously and flicked it
several times before the chair finally stretched itself out and
turned into a couch. She sank into it, kicking her shoes off as she
propped them on the opposite arm rest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, wrong …"
echoed Hermione absently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wrong?"
parroted Harry, staring at Ginny's legs as she flexed her toes and
her robes slid aside.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes Harry,"
smirked Ginny, shifting slightly so that her skirt rode a little
higher. "Wrong because Ron's missing; the five of us are here …
without Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, that's
wrong," muttered Harry. He took the two steps to Ginny's couch
and lifted her legs up so he could sit under them. Neither Ginny nor
Harry minded that her skirt rode up a few more inches as he caressed
her calves.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, show a little
bit of interest," muttered Hermione. Harry looked up at her in
surprise but she was smiling at them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry," Harry
apologised sheepishly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry,
it'll be first Hogsmeade weekend before we know it," said Ginny,
trailing a hand across Harry's neck. His skin tingled where she
touched it. "We can all go together and meet up with Ron. Well,
unless you guys have plans?" She turned to Neville and Luna.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I haven't
got any plans," said Luna making a flourish in her magazine with a
large purple quill. "Have you got a new girlfriend Neville?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, n-no,"
Neville stammered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh good," said
Luna as she turned a page and suddenly stabbed the quill aggressively
into the page. "Then you can be my boyfriend without fear of
reprisal." Neville raised his eyebrows and looked desperately at
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"B-boyfriend?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, we should
give it a try," Luna continued, pulling the quill out of the
magazine and turning it upside down. "I suggest we make people
aware of our new relationship at the feast tonight."</p><p class="calibre8">"Um …" Neville
was clearly speechless and he looked desperately at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, if you're
not going to just <em class="calibre9">ask</em> Hannah out, Neville," said Ginny as
she stared at the ceiling, "then you may as well give it a whirl
with Luna."</p><p class="calibre8">"But I can't ask
Hannah out, she hasn't come back to Hogwarts," Neville said a
trifle morosely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, what is she
doing then?" asked Hermione as she straightened her parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's got some
sort of traineeship or something at The Leaky Cauldron," answered
Neville. "She said she wants to be like a hostess or something. I
don't know what she meant. She's learning how to run the pub."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, she'll be
great at that," said Luna suddenly. "I expect you'll marry her
one day."</p><p class="calibre8">"Didn't you just
ask Neville out?" asked Hermione sharply. "Why would you say he's
going to marry Hannah?" Luna lowered the Quibbler and stared at
Hermione, her eyes looking more protuberant than ever.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everybody needs
practice Hermione," she said. "I am quite willing to be Neville's
practice. After all didn't you practice with Viktor Krum and Ronald
practiced with Lavender Brown and Harry practiced with Cho. And Ginny
has had a lot of practice-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks Luna,"
interrupted Neville hastily as he glanced at Hermione and Ginny who
had turned pink and were both glaring at Luna.</p><p class="calibre8">"Besides," added
Luna, going back to her magazine, "going out with me solves many
problems. If you are going out with me it will be easier to turn down
all the other girls who throw themselves at you." Neville just
stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why would he want
to do that?" asked Harry incredulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because I heard
Romilda Vane telling Lucy Watford and Chelsea Stone that she was
going after him this year and nothing was going to stand in her way,"
answered Luna serenely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna?" said
Neville suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes Neville?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Will you go out
with me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course,"
answered Luna, laying her quill in the Quibbler like a bookmark. She
stood up and grabbed Neville's hand, pulling him to the door.
"Let's go and find the trolley, I feel like a Pumpkin Pasty and I
can check if there are Pluffwogs in the Liquorice Wands."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry stared after
them in wonder and Ginny giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"That is going to
be interesting," she said and Harry could only agree.</p><p class="calibre8">The rest of the trip
was uneventful except for the time Dennis Creevey came stumbling into
the Prefects compartment mumbling about his eyesight. It took some
effort but Hermione managed to discover the source of his distress.
Dennis had inadvertently opened the loo at the end of the carriage
while doing a patrol.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought it was
a cloakroom!" he wailed. "B-but Neville and L-Luna! They … with
the … horrible …"</p><p class="calibre8">Dennis had been the
first to learn of Neville and Luna's new status. He was entirely
unwilling to explain exactly what it was that had him covering his
eyes and stammering incoherently. Harry could only make an educated
guess. Given his recent thoughts about dragging Ginny into a small
confined and <em class="calibre9">private</em> space, it wasn't difficult to imagine
at all.</p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't easy
for Harry to keep a straight face when Neville and Luna came back
into the compartment. Ginny grinned at him and Hermione was clearly
trying not to laugh as she straightened the already tidy papers on
her lap. Luna sat down and opened her Quibbler before addressing
Neville who was standing in the doorway with a dazed expression on
his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think you
should ask Hermione to clean that lipstick off your uniform Neville,"
Luna said idly, turning the page of her magazine. "She's got
excellent skills in cleaning charms and Professor McGonagall will
probably pick up on it otherwise."</p><p class="calibre8">It was a full five
minutes before Hermione was sober enough to perform the requisite
charm.</p><p class="calibre8">*****************</p><p class="calibre8">Darkness fell over
them like a blanket when they arrived at Hogsmeade Station and
students were spilling onto the platform, chattering excitedly. Harry
peered cautiously out of his compartment. When he'd attempted to
buy some Chocolate Frogs from the trolley at about four o'clock
he'd been accosted by four incredibly silly girls. He later
insisted to Ginny that they had tried to touch him inappropriately.
Ginny had only grinned and subtly reached out and pinched his bum.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Harry," said
Hermione as she pushed him into the corridor. "Get a move on. You
just need to act normally."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah, and what
is normal?" muttered Harry as he tried to flatten his hair and make
his way to the end of the carriage to step down onto the platform. He
hesitated before opening the door, peering out of the window to see
Hagrid standing on the end of the platform, calling <em class="calibre9">'Firs'
years over here!'</em> as if nothing had changed. Harry felt so
different. How could things be going on as normal and yet be so
different? Surely things had changed. Was he the only one who didn't
notice how different the air felt? Harry could sense a mixture of
fear and anticipation coupled with the kind of excitement that
signalled the start of a school year.</p><p class="calibre8">The distant chatter
of students speculating about the feast and the booming of Hagrid's
voice blended with the water lapping softly at the edge of the lake.
Harry could hear the creaking of the Thestral-drawn carriages and
soft snuffling sounds as the animals waited patiently. These sounds
were both familiar and foreign. Harry felt apprehensive yet at the
same time he felt at peace; as if he was drifting unanchored on a
calm sea. Ginny grabbed his hand and he turned to smile at her. Her
presence was his anchor; it was all he needed. Unable to stop
himself, he leaned down and kissed her softly, as if drawing the
strength he'd need from her, before pushing open the carriage door
and stepping down onto the platform.</p><p class="calibre8">The air was brisk
and a gust of wind lifted the hem of Harry's robes as he glanced at
the group of students with Hagrid. A handful of them were bigger than
the rest and he spotted Gerald among this group, looking
long-suffering as Gilbert danced around him, proclaiming his
excitement. Hagrid caught sight of Harry and raised an arm in
greeting. Harry waved back as several of the smaller students turned
around to see who Hagrid was acknowledging. Several jaws dropped in
unison and Harry stifled a groan.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right?"
called Hagrid.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right!"
Harry called back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of to the
carriages with yer then!" called Hagrid over the wind, which seemed
to be picking up. He turned to the students in front of him. "Don'
want ter be late! All right First' Years over here. If you've not
been to 'Ogwarts before, this way!"</p><p class="calibre8">"How are we going
to get to school if we don't go in the carriages?" Harry heard
Gilbert say.</p><p class="calibre8">"I do believe he
wants us to get into those boats," Gerald replied, eying the edge
of the lake suspiciously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cool," breathed
Gilbert.</p><p class="calibre8">"I do not wish to
travel in a boat," sniffed Gerald. "With this weather, it could
be a disaster." Hagrid suddenly looked worried.</p><p class="calibre8">"But yer hafta go
in the boats," he said. "It's how yer get inter 'Ogwarts."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry!"
said Dean materialising from behind Harry and striding towards the
starting students. "No one's drowned in years!" He clapped the
younger boy on the back so hard that Gerald stumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I nearly
drowned," piped up Dennis Creevey from a few metres away. "But
Hagrid pulled me right out! You'll be fine!"</p><p class="calibre8">"He, on the other
hand might not be," muttered Seamus from behind Harry. Seamus spoke
so quietly Harry could barely hear him. Harry looked at Dennis. He
seemed all right, but when you looked closer you could see that his
shoulders were hunched up around his ears and his face looked tense
and drawn. Harry turned away and started towards the carriages before
stopping abruptly. He could hear the new students behind him laughing
and splashing as they clambered into the boats but the large number
of students in front of him were standing almost silently, still on
the platform.</p><p class="calibre8">"Some Slytherin
fool started blathering about Thestrals and now no one will leave the
platform," said Seamus, by way of explanation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna and Neville
convinced a few to go but most people are a bit …" added Dean as
he wandered back towards Harry. "What is with those two anyway? Why
are they holding hands?"</p><p class="calibre8">"They're going
out," whispered Ginny. Dean pulled a face.</p><p class="calibre8">"She dumped me to
go out with him?" Dean asked incredulously. "At least you dumped
me for Harry Potter." Seamus snickered and Hermione snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"She also went out
with three Hufflepuffs and a Ravenclaw and tried to seduce Oliver
Wood,' said Ginny mischievously, "if that makes you feel any
better?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not really,"
grumbled Dean.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's go and
get these people into the carriages," said Harry, desperate to
change the subject.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," said
Seamus, "we figured if anyone can, you can."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's eyes
roamed over the students in front of him. He recognised some of them,
some were familiar in a way he couldn't place and a few were
strangers. Many of them looked worried, some looked scared.</p><p class="calibre8">"We have to get
them into the carriages," whispered Hermione desperately as she
surveyed the students in front of them. "We're in charge.
Professor McGonagall expects us to organise the students so they
arrive in a timely manner for the Feast." Harry saw no feasible way
of doing this and just looked at Hermione helplessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on Harry,"
said Dean. "You say 'jump' and they'll say 'how high?'
Just cast a <em class="calibre9">Sonorous</em> and order everyone to get in."</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't just
order someone to face their fears, Dean," Harry replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't wanna
see a Thestral," said Dennis suddenly, sounding terribly small.
"It'll make it real."</p><p class="calibre8">"You have to <em class="calibre9">help</em>
them face their fears," said Hermione. Harry looked at her and
smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, you do,"
he said. "Come on Dennis, you can ride with us." He slung his arm
around the boy's shoulders and began walking forwards.</p><p class="calibre8">"B-b-but the
Thestrals," stammered Dennis pitifully. "They're horrible and
grotesque and what if – what if they e-eat me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"They're bad
luck," said a small boy nearby. "I don't want no bad luck. I
don't wanna die!"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's seeing a
Grim you idiot," said the boy next to him, rolling his eyes.
"You're not gunna <em class="calibre9">die</em> from seeing a Thestral."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry's seen
'em loads of times and he's fine!" said Seamus in an attempt to
be helpful.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure, Seamus,"
muttered Harry. "That'll reassure them."</p><p class="calibre8">"They are not bad
luck," said Hermione authoritatively. "And they won't eat you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"They <em class="calibre9">are</em>
classified as dangerous, however," said a prim looking girl folding
her arms across her chest. She was unfortunate enough to look a
little like Umbridge and the expression on her face did nothing to
ease the resemblance.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only if you annoy
them," retorted Seamus. "Are you planning on getting into a
carriage or annoying them?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
doing here anyway?" asked the girl as she eyed Seamus suspiciously.
"You were here last year. I saw you, creating havoc in the
corridors. You were a seventh year." Seamus pulled himself up to
his full height so that he could look down on her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah I was here
last year and I was creating havoc and you'd better thank your
lucky stars that I was," he said, puffing out his chest
importantly. The girl shook her head and turned away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh so in, mate,"
murmured Dean appreciatively.</p><p class="calibre8">"So in for what?"
Harry asked, turning to Dean, leaving the student-herding to
Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Didn't you see
her?" asked Seamus incredulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"See her what?"
asked Harry. "Look down her nose at you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, Harry, Harry,
Harry… you have a lot to learn," said Dean, slapping him on the
back. "Oi! You lot get a move on! We don't want to stand on this
platform all night!" He waved his other hand at the students in
front of them and began moving them forward like a herd of sheep.</p><p class="calibre8">"She noticed me,"
said Seamus, "creating havoc. She so wants me."</p><p class="calibre8">"If you say so,"
said Harry, shrugging as he moved forward with Dennis still under the
shelter of one arm and Ginny clinging to his other hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"You wait and
see!" called Seamus after him. "She'll be going out with me by
the end of the month!"</p><p class="calibre8">The moving tide of
students seemed to stop and Harry had to battle through them to get
to the carriages. Hermione was standing in front of a group of awed
third years, trying to convince them to get in a carriage. One boy
was shaking his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I liked them
better horseless," he protested. "How do we know they aren't
going to bite us? What if we annoy them and we don't know we
annoyed them?"</p><p class="calibre8">"They look gross,"
said a brown-haired girl in disgust.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not going
anywhere near that thing!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't see
anything," protested one boy, several feet away from Harry. "Why
can't I see them? I wanna see them!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No you don't,"
muttered Dennis, shivering.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, where were
you last year?" Hermione asked the boy, clearly losing patience
with the students.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Roderick here
wasn't at school last year," volunteered a short, plump girl
Harry thought he recognised as a Ravenclaw.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't reckon
you had to be at school last year to be able to see 'em,"
muttered Kevin Whitby, the Hufflepuff fifth year Prefect. "Taylor
Banks wasn't here and he's cowering over in that corner."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sighed
heavily; that the war had touched almost every child on the platform,
some as young as twelve years old, depressed him. The cacophony of
voices rose around him as more students left the platform and caught
sight of the creatures for the first time. More than one girl
screamed and there were several expressions of loathing or disgust.
He slowly moved forward, Dennis slipped out of his grasp and Ginny
let go of his hand, probably to comfort Dennis, he didn't know, he
was intent on the Thestral harnessed to the second carriage.</p><p class="calibre8">The animal was
looking at him, its white eyes glowing in the dark so brightly Harry
felt like it was communicating with him. The Thestral ducked its head
slightly as Harry approached and he realised it was the one he'd
ridden to London, which seemed like a lifetime ago. He reached out to
stroke the animal on its nose and it raised its head and snuffled
softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Better be careful
you don't get bitten, Potter!" called a voice full of disdain
from the front carriage. Malfoy, the sixth year Prefect and several
Slytherins were seated in the carriage.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not the one
who taunted a Hippogriff, Malfoy," Harry retorted. "I actually
listened in Care of Magical Creatures." The Thestral stretched its
neck out and butted Harry gently on the cheek as if to prove his
point. Harry turned questioningly to the Thestral, unaware that his
actions and the Thestral's response had caused the students to fall
silent.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well you
always did have a lot of sheer, dumb luck, didn't you Potter?"
Malfoy sneered before pulling his head back into the carriage. Harry
watched as the first carriage took off and the Thestral he was
standing with nudged his hand. Harry turned to it.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're ready to
go, aren't you?" he asked. The Thestral shook its head as if in
agreement. "Okay, let's go." Harry opened the door to the
carriage and motioned to Hermione and Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes, come with
us," came Luna's voice from inside. Dennis, who was clinging to
the end of Ginny's sleeve and walking as far away from the Thestral
as he could manage, blanched.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're not
going to snog again are they?" he whispered desperately and Harry
tried in vain to stop the laughter. Pushing Dennis up the carriage
steps he turned to watch the student body cautiously approach the
carriages and climb in. A few of the girls squawked when the animals
turned to look at them and he heard a few sighs of disgust, and saw a
few shudders, but the students soon organised themselves into he
carriages. Harry ducked back into his own carriage and squeezed in
between Hermione and Ginny, stifling a grin at the look of disgust on
Dennis's face as Luna swung her legs into Neville's lap, and they
headed off along the lane to Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre8">The carriage Malfoy
had been riding in was standing outside the entrance to the castle
when Harry's carriage pulled up. The Slytherins who had been inside
it were nowhere to be seen. Slowly the six of them climbed out of the
carriage and stood in front of the great oak doors. Harry, having
helped Ginny down, kept a hold of her hand and he felt her hand
gripping his tightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cor the old girl
cleaned up all right," said Seamus cheerfully from behind Harry.
"Never thought I'd see the castle looking this good again. Made a
right mess of it last time we were here-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Seamus!" hissed
Hermione. Harry turned to look at him and noticed students
disembarking from the carriages, but unlike past years no one was
streaming up the steps and inside. There was no cheerful noise, just
a quiet murmuring and a few people looking sideways at him as if they
were waiting for him to do something. Harry cleared his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, the first
years'll be arriving soon, we'd better go inside," he said
loudly and motioned to Hermione with his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, right, yes of
course," added Hermione in a loud voice that sounded just a little
bit fake. "Come on then. Let's go." She grabbed Seamus by the
elbow and tugged at Dennis's arm and she and Harry started up the
steps. It was as if Harry putting his foot on that first step into
Hogwarts broke some sort of spell. Students began clambering up the
steps, chattering madly. Harry pushed the great oak doors open and
stepped into the Entrance Hall. As the students spilled through the
great oak doors things began to seem more like students at the start
of a new school year and less like a procession of mourners entering
a mausoleum.</p><p class="calibre8">As he walked through
the Entrance Hall Harry could hear excited girls comparing their new
robes, nonchalant boys comparing their new haircuts and a few people
who had misplaced their pets. He had chosen to let Liberty fly to
Hogwarts, not wanting to carry her in a cage on the train. She had
grown a bit more in the last few months, looking more and more like
Hedwig. Sometimes Harry felt sad as he watched her fly in circles
above The Burrow. She looked so much like Hedwig and she showed the
exact same disdain for Pig's antics that Hedwig had. A few times he
caught himself calling her Hedwig. But she wasn't Hedwig, she
didn't respond to Harry and his moods the way Hedwig had, she was a
more excitable bird and despite looking almost exactly like Hedwig
had, she definitely wasn't the same. Harry was getting used to her
but he just couldn't face it if she'd been mistaken for Hedwig by
well meaning students. He felt terrible every time he did it himself
and a sense of guilt and loss settled in the pit of his stomach like
a stone. Harry was grateful to Hagrid for bringing him Liberty and he
was fond of the bird but he was finding it hard to bond with her
because she simply couldn't replace Hedwig. He now understood why
the Weasleys kept Errol.</p><p class="calibre8">Crookshanks and Dora
had been collected by Hagrid the day before so that Hermione could
concentrate on her Head Girl duties without worrying about her cat.
Ron had said she was daft if she thought Crookshanks was going to
stop her from doing her duties and a full scale row had ensued. Harry
had excused himself and gone out to help Ginny secure Dora for
transport. He'd actually grown quite attached to the little Creeler
and found he was looking forward to seeing her tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre8">An awed silence fell
as the doors to the Great Hall swung open. Malfoy was standing just
outside them and he gazed lazily at the crowd of students.</p><p class="calibre8">"Get a move on
then," he called out. "I'd like to eat before midnight."</p><p class="calibre8">"After Harry,"
said Dennis Creevey suddenly sounding a lot stronger than he had all
day. "He should go first, it's only right." Malfoy scowled.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just a
room," he said disdainfully. "Why should Potter go first?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's not just
a room, you tosser!" called Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, how lovely, a
word from the peanut gallery," said Malfoy in faux pleasure. "Come
Astoria my dear, let us go and get a seat."</p><p class="calibre8">"Astoria?" Harry
heard Ginny smirk. "What sort of name is Astoria?"</p><p class="calibre8">Although Malfoy and
the girl called Astoria had stepped into the Great Hall, Harry could
see that none of the other students had moved. A couple of teachers
were conversing in low tones at the Head Table. Harry thought it was
Professor Vector and Professor Sinistra but he wasn't sure, their
bent heads obscured by enormous brimmed hats. Professor Trelwaney,
unmistakable in her trailing shawls and large eyeglasses, was sitting
watching her plate closely and Professor Sprout, in her patched hat,
was quietly gazing out over the Hall and beaming at the students in
the doorway. Harry couldn't see Professor McGongall, which
surprised him, but he had little time to think on it as Hermione
began whispering and poking him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop that," he
snapped at her, rubbing his side where she'd poked him a little
overzealously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on Harry,"
she hissed back. "If you go in, they'll all go in."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked at the
inviting Hall, its ceiling twinkling with numberless stars, the
floating candles casting a warm glow and the tables laid out to greet
them. It was just how it had always looked and Harry felt a warm
feeling spread outward from the centre of his chest until his fingers
and toes tingled. He glanced around at the students milling about in
the Entrance Hall and then stepped towards the doors.</p><p class="calibre8">Although he had been
in the Great Hall since that final confrontation with Voldemort, it
had been a broken and dusty place. Now the fireplaces crackled with
inviting fires, new beams sat in the corners, holding up lamps on
glittering new chains. The four House tables shone once more. Harry
looked around in awe, slowly walking into the Great Hall, the rest of
the students following him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look," said
Ginny softly, her hand gripping his own. Harry looked to where she
was pointing with her other hand. There, near the door to the Trophy
Room sat Dumbledore's chair. A gleaming new plaque shone above it.
The other students were sitting at their House tables, the chatter
once again rising in volume, but Harry walked slowly up to the chair,
reaching out to touch the plaque and read what was inscribed there.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">This
chair remains a monument to the bravery and sacrifice of those
headmasters who gave their lives in the service and defence of this
school during the Second War.</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Albus
Dumbledore and Severus Snape</em></p><p class="calibre8">"I couldn't bear
to sit in it," said a soft voice at Harry's shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a
wonderful monument, Professor," said Harry, turning to face
McGonagall. "I'm sure you'll follow in their footsteps
brilliantly."</p><p class="calibre8">"Only for this
year, Mr Potter," she answered. "I'm getting on Harry. The
school needs someone younger, new blood." She looked suddenly old
as she turned away.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry lingered over
the chair for only a moment longer before turning towards the
Gryffindor table. As he passed the Slytherin table he heard Malfoy
talking to Astoria who was rapidly being established as his new
girlfriend. Harry wondered idly what Pansy Parkinson thought about
that but was jolted from his thoughts by Malfoy's sardonic
comments.</p><p class="calibre8">"It still might be
a good year. You can't assume that old McGonagall is going to play
favourites. Although I suppose it's a good bet," he drawled. It
was as if he knew Harry was approaching. His next comment was
designed to goad. "Saint Potter's the Golden Boy, so he's bound
to get favoured. Already has if you ask me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Malfoy, just let
it go," said Harry quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, the
reverence you're shown is a bit much to stomach is all," said
Malfoy idly. Harry leaned over so that his face was dangerously close
to Malfoy's and spoke quietly but forcefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe you had it
good here last year," he said. "But most of these kids were
fighting for their lives. This place is the scene of a battle. A
bloody, fierce battle and probably more than half these students were
here for that.</p><p class="calibre8">"They saw people
<em class="calibre9">die</em> here, Malfoy. They saw the grounds of their school
drenched in blood and draped with bodies. They lost friends, they
lost family and <em class="calibre9">you</em> will not belittle and mock the struggles
and losses we have all experienced."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't assume
last year was a picnic for me," said Malfoy darkly. "You weren't
even here. What would you know? You were in hiding like a coward."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you
<em class="calibre9">dare</em>," hissed Ginny suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Or what
Weaselette?" Malfoy asked, sniggering. "What's a little girl
like you going to do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't want
to find out Malfoy," Ginny said dangerously. Harry put a
restraining hand on her arm but she shook it off. "I can do things
to you that would make you cry like a baby. You can thank your little
Death Eater friends for my new skills in that area."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I am so
scared," Malfoy said coolly, mockingly. "Why so protective of
Potter anyway? Protecting your way out of that hovel you call a
house-" He was cut off by Harry's wand resting against his
throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you ever
talk to her like that," said Harry through gritted teeth. "And
don't you try and tell any of us that what we went through last
year wasn't as bad what you did. <em class="calibre9">Don't</em> insult their memory
like that."</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Mr Potter!</em>"
Harry turned to see Professor McGonagall looking thunderous.</p><p class="calibre8">"Uh oh, now you're
in for it," muttered Malfoy gleefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Am I to
understand it that you are engaging in fighting in my school?" the
Professor asked. "In the Great Hall no less, before we even begin!"
The noise level in the Great Hall dropped as students tried to listen
into the altercation. Harry could see Hermione frowning at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just …
well …"</p><p class="calibre8">"See to it that
you cease to engage in fighting in this school, Mr Potter,"
McGonagall interrupted briskly. "Any further incidents will be met
with a detention. I am sure you are aware exactly what sort of
example we expect from the Head Boy; and from our Prefects Mr
Malfoy." She fixed them both with an icy glare before stalking to
the Head table in a swish of tartan.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" scolded
Hermione as Harry when he got to the Gryffindor table. "I can't
believe you got into trouble the minute you got here!" Harry just
looked at her and shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"He started it,"
he said. It was his only defence and Hermione rolled her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
she said that to you," said Seamus, shaking his head as they sat
down at the Gryffindor table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, she is the
Headmistress," said Harry reasonably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I think
it's a bit rich," said Dean. "They can't go changing the
rules on you like that. I bet no one gave you a detention last time
you had a fight in the Great Hall."</p><p class="calibre8">They were still
laughing riotously when Professor Flitwick entered the room carrying
a stool and a battered floppy hat.</p><p class="calibre8">Most of the starting
students walked into the Great Hall slowly, clearly awed by the vista
in front of them. Harry saw the three boys he had met in Weasley's
Wizard Wheezes. Othello was striding solemnly along the aisle between
the tables. Hamish was ambling along beside him, his hands in his
pockets looking curiously at his surroundings. Dexter was trotting
along behind them, his hands clutching a fat toad and his shorter
legs struggling to keep up with his friends. His roaming eye caught
Harry's and he smiled widely. Harry smiled back and then noticed
Gilbert, still galloping in excitement around his older brother who
was staring disdainfully at the tattered Hat that sat on the stool
and towered over Professor Flitwick.</p><p class="calibre8">Gilbert was
chattering excitedly and Harry wondered how long the older brother
would be able to tolerate the younger boy. At that moment Gilbert
noticed Harry and waved at him enthusiastically. Harry returned the
greeting and settled back to study the Head Table as he waited for
the Sorting to begin. Hagrid had come in before the first years and
was sitting next to a short, wiry little man with thinning grey hair.
He had a bulbous red nose and beady little eyes. His floppy hat fell
incongruously over his left ear. The other teachers were familiar,
except for a plump motherly looking witch in sparkling blue robes and
a thin man with striking blue eyes and a ridiculous brown fuzzy hat
that Harry eventually realised was actually a cat when it suddenly
uncurled, stretched and leapt lightly onto the floor. Harry craned
his neck to see where it had gone and finally located it curled up on
the man's right foot. He nudged Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who do you
suppose that is?" he asked her.</p><p class="calibre8">"New teacher,"
Hermione whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know that,"
Harry answered, rolling his eyes. "What's his name?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
Harry, now shush," she hissed back. Harry fell silent in quiet
contemplation of these new teachers. The short, wiry man with the
bulbous nose was acting terribly nervous and when Harry caught his
eye the man dropped his serviette and ducked under the table. Harry
moved his contemplation to the motherly woman who was sitting next to
Professor Trelawney and patting her on the hand gently. She seemed
inoffensive enough but simply wasn't giving off enough clues for
Harry to think anything more of her.</p><p class="calibre8">The thin man with
the cat hat most intrigued Harry however. His blue eyes sparkled as
he surveyed the students and he seemed at ease, even happy to be
there, something Harry rarely recalled seeing in his teachers.
Slughorn was sitting on the end of the table wearing an impossibly
vibrant purple waistcoat under garish green robes that glittered with
silver embroidery.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who cares who
they are," said Ginny petulantly. "I hope this Sorting doesn't
take too long, I'm starving." Harry and Hermione exchanged an
amused glance with Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Although I

was tall, the end of it trailing on the floor. Harry felt a soft warm
hand slide onto his knee and he turned to look at Ginny. She was
staring at the Hat, her face pale. She looked apprehensive and just a
little unsure.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right?" he
asked her, sliding an am around her shoulders. She nodded jerkily and
did not resist as he drew her closer, and heedless of the crowd
around them, pressed a kiss to the top of her head. Ginny's hand
tightened on his leg and Harry rubbed her arm slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was on fire,"
was all she whispered, closing her eyes. Harry didn't know what to
say so he wrapped his other arm around her and rubbed her back.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay now,"
he said to her. "That's all over." He watched the first student
sit under the Hat and in his mind's eye he saw the flaming Hat on
Neville's head. Harry shook the image from his head and turned back
to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm all right,"
she said suddenly, pulling away from Harry and sitting up, pretending
she hadn't been unnerved by the sight of the singing Hat.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had not seen
the first few Sortings, intent as he had been on Ginny. He looked up
and saw a small red-headed girl hurrying to the Hufflepuff table and
noticed there were no new additions to the Gryffindor table. Gerald
Chumley was now making his way up to the Hat, still eyeing it
disdainfully. He put the Hat on his head tentatively and sat there
for some time, it looked like he was arguing with it. Eventually
Gerald tore the Hat off his head and dumped it forcefully on the
stool before stomping towards the Gryffindor table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gryffindor,"
the Hat squawked belatedly. Gerald sat heavily at the Gryffindor
table and barely nodded at Hermione as she greeted him, eyeing the
Ravenclaw table longingly. Dennis Creevey was looking at the younger
boy askance and many of the Ravenclaws seemed relieved. The tense
silence that blanketed the rest of the hall was broken by Gilbert. He
clattered noisily up the steps before Professor Flitwick even called
his name and picked up the Hat carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry about him,"
he said cheerfully to the Hat as he straightened out the tip and
dusted it off a little. "He's a bit of a git and thinks he's
right brainy. I 'spect he wanted Ravenclaw, didn't he? I can't
wait to see where you think I should go!" The Great Hall broke out
in titters and giggles as Gilbert placed the Hat delicately on his
own head. It was only seconds later that the rip in the brim of the
hat opened and shouted 'GRYFFINDOR!'</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's
obvious that one's got guts," said Seamus as Gilbert, a wide
smile on his face galloped towards the Gryffindor table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Welcome to
Gryffindor, Gilbert," smiled Hermione, not put off by his older
brother's earlier snub.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're the Head
Girl, aren't you?" Gilbert said breathlessly. Hermione nodded. "I
know. I could see the badge on your robes. I'm very observant like
that." The boy subsided for a moment and his brother scowled at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you think
of Hogwarts so far?" Ginny asked him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's
<em class="calibre9">brilliant</em>," said Gilbert excitedly. "Did you see that big
guy who took us on the boats? He's like a <em class="calibre9">giant</em>! I bet he's
the biggest man in the whole world!" Hermione stifled her laughter
by turning it into a cough and Harry grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, that's
Hagrid," said Ginny. "He's the Care of Magical Creatures
teacher, look." She pointed at the head table where the teachers
were watching intently as Doris Mumford and Boris Newman were sorted
into Hufflepuff. Seamus snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Doris and Boris,
Hufflepuff has scored this year!" he chuckled as the rather pudgy
boy squeezed into a seat at his new House table. The number of first
years left was dwindling and only a handful of the older starting
students remained when Gilbert began talking again.</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope there will
be more in Gryffindor," he said. "I wouldn't like to write home
and tell Mum that I don't think I'll have any friends in my
year." The boy frowned slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"That is if you
write to Mother at all," said Gerald pompously. "I daresay you'll
get so caught up in the … <em class="calibre9">excitement</em> of everything that
you'll forget and it will be up to me to remind you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not going
to forget," Gilbert said petulantly. "You're the one who gets
caught up in all your reading, and your studying. I'll probably
have to remind you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, just see
that you write to her," Gerald said stiffly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I will if you
will," retorted Gilbert.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll both
write to her," interjected Harry. "Every week." Gerald merely
looked down his nose at Harry but Gilbert turned to him excitedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're the Head
Boy," he said. Gilbert jerked a thumb at Hermione. "Your badge
matches hers. I didn't know you were the Head Boy when we met you
at the train station." He seemed about to say something else but
wasn't given the chance because the Gryffindor table erupted in
cheers as another first year was sorted into the House.</p><p class="calibre8">Othello made his way
towards the Gryffindor table smiling brightly and was immediately
pounced on by Gilbert. The two of them began an animated conversation
that had Gerald scowling heavily. When Hamish was sorted into
Gryffindor moments later he and Othello high-fived each other
enthusiastically and the three boys sat watching and waiting. Harry
knew they were waiting for Dexter. The small boy stood nervously,
clutching his toad until Professor Flitwick called out '<em class="calibre9">Marjorie
Smith</em>,' when the toad suddenly leapt out of Dexter's hands
and hopped over to Marjorie, a tall, thin girl with long blonde hair
and rosy pink cheeks. Marjorie screeched, Dexter dived for the toad
and Othello and Hamish both leapt from their seats.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told you buying
a toad was a bad idea!" Hamish bellowed. Othello reached the still
screeching Marjorie and dived beneath the hem of her robes,
undoubtedly in search of Dexter's toad but Marjorie obviously
didn't see it that way and began beating him on the back while
still dancing about.</p><p class="calibre8">"CATCH THAT FROG!"
she screeched over and over again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bartholomew!"
cried Dexter plaintively, looking about in vain for the toad.</p><p class="calibre8">"I keep telling
you," called Hamish excitedly, "call him Bart!" Othello,
defending himself from the blows Marjorie was raining on him, pulled
away from the girl, his hands raised over his head.</p><p class="calibre8">The motherly new
teacher and Professor Sinistra hurriedly got up from their chairs and
hurried towards the first years, most of whom were now in various
states of distress with one small girl crying piteously into a tiny
white handkerchief. Hermione, galvanised into action as the sight of
the crying child, grabbed Harry by the arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on," she
said urgently, "we need to help!" Harry had no idea what exactly
she wanted him to do but obediently got up, prepared to throw himself
into the chaos. Dexter was still wailing plaintively for his pet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi! Neville, find
that toad!" shouted Harry over the din. Neville leapt up and
scanned the floor before heading to the Ravenclaw table where several
girls were standing on one of the benches.</p><p class="calibre8">Othello, obviously
unaware or uncaring of his earlier faux pas had dived towards
Marjorie again and she recommenced her screeching, adding to the
caterwauling. Hermione had reached the small girl crying into her
handkerchief and the two teachers had settled down a few of the other
students, one of whom, however, was trying to climb on the Sorting
Hat stool wailing about mice. Professor Flitwick was struggling under
the Hat which had been knocked onto his head and Harry could hear the
diminutive Professor squeaking that he had already been sorted and
that the 'blasted Hat' should know that. Harry reached out and
pulled Othello upright by the back of his robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right
Marjorie, that's enough," he said. "Othello is not trying to
look up your robes. Othello, mate, don't go looking under girl's
robes even if it is to find a toad. You and Hamish go and sit down,
next to Gilbert." The two boys did as they were bid, both looking
slightly dishevelled and sheepish.</p><p class="calibre8">"Get off the
stool," Harry motioned to the girl who was still perched on the
edge of it and strode over to pull the Hat off Flitwick's head
while the Professor struggled with his scroll of parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"The rest of you
just calm down," Harry commanded. "You're not going to die at
the hands of Dexter's toad." The first years looked at him with a
mixture of awe and amazement and the crying and screeching slowly
subsided.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've got the
toad!" called Neville. He was emerging from under the Hufflepuff
table, the fat toad clasped in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dexter," Harry
said patiently. "Get a carry basket for Bartholomew, okay?"
Dexter nodded solemnly as Neville reached him and handed back his
toad.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think we're
ready to continue with this Sorting, Professor," said Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, this is the
biggest farce I have even been witness to," said Gerald loudly. "It
looks like these teachers have no control whatsoever. <em class="calibre9">Students</em>
shouldn't be telling us what to do."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's enough,
Gerald," said Harry. "I know you don't want to be here, but
just make the effort, okay?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't tell
me what to do!" retorted the boy, his voice rising to a shout. "Who
died and made you the boss anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">A deathly silence
fell over the Great Hall. Harry scratched the back of his neck
uncomfortably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi, do you know
who this is mate?" Seamus asked. He looked ready to get up and deck
Gerald.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's the Head
Boy," said Gerald scathingly. "I thought that was well
established."</p><p class="calibre8">"The Head Boy is
supposed to help the teachers, Gerald," Harry hastily interrupted,
sensing Seamus was about to really erupt. Harry turned to Seamus and
shook his head slightly and Seamus subsided. Professor Flitwick
cleared his throat and squeaked Marjorie's name again. This time
the girl made it to the Sorting Hat without incident and the Hat
bellowed 'GRYFFINDOR!' almost immediately.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" gasped
Othello loudly. "She's never brave!" Marjorie halted on her way
to the Gryffindor table before continuing and sitting at the very
end, turning away haughtily from the scowling boys.</p><p class="calibre8">The Sorting
continued with another four girls into Gryffindor and two Slytherin
boys, then Dexter was the only one left. He scampered up to the
stool, Bartholomew clutched in one hand and cramming the Hat on his
head with the other. The Hat fell right over the boy's eyes and he
looked extremely comical sitting on the edge of the stool, his legs
dangling, his face almost entirely hidden. Bartholomew the toad let
out a loud croak as the Hat deliberated over Dexter. His friends
looked tense as they watched anxiously, the Hat taking it's time.</p><p class="calibre8">"GRYFFINDOR!"
the Hat shouted eventually and Harry saw Othello and Hamish slump in
relief. Dexter hopped off the stool triumphantly and pulled the Hat
off his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes!" he cried
and practically ran over to the Gryffindor table, Bartholomew
swinging precariously from one hand. The four first year boys
high-fived and back slapped each other heartily as Professor
McGonagall arose and tapped her goblet to gain everyone's
attention. Dexter was still hopping about next to Harry who reached
over and pushed him into a seat.</p><p class="calibre8">"To those of you,
for whom this is your first night with us, welcome," Professor
McGonagall said. "To the rest, welcome back." She was looking
right at Harry and Hermione when she said this, her eyes sparkling
suspiciously and Harry blinked to prevent his own tears from falling.
The tables suddenly blossomed with food and the first years gasped in
amazement. Gerald Chumley looked entirely unsettled.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is so cool,"
breathed Gilbert reaching for a drumstick and some mashed potatoes at
the same time. He stopped dead when a ghostly, silvery heard shot up
through his plate and he dropped the drumstick with a squawk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good evening!"
boomed Sir Nicholas. "And welcome to Gryffindor!"</p><p class="calibre8">"W-who are you?"
stammered Gilbert.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you know
anything?" Marjorie Smith asked with a superior look. "That's
Sir Nicholas, the Gryffindor House Ghost."</p><p class="calibre8">"Nearly Headless
Nick?" asked Dexter, his mouth falling open. He turned triumphantly
to Hamish and Othello. "I told you he was real!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Cool," breathed
Gilbert, watching Sir Nicholas avidly. "This place is so cool."
Gerald sniffed and turned to his mashed potatoes.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry could only
agree with Gilbert. Hogwarts was cool and he was glad he'd come. He
piled his plate high and began eating; listening with half an ear to
Seamus' far-fetched stories of his summer in Ireland with his Great
Uncle Patrick. Harry let the hum of the Great Hall wash over him as
he ate. The familiar sights and sounds soothed his soul and he felt
at ease despite the fact that the Ghosts kept startling Gerald and
making two of the new first year girls scream.</p><p class="calibre8">"Peeves!"
shouted Harry eventually after the fifth time the poltergeist had
swooped past the Gryffindor table and pelted the students with bread
rolls. "Stop it!" Peeves turned around, a bread roll held aloft
over Neville's head. He stared at Harry for a moment before
saluting and, lowering the bread roll, soared up and through the wall
at the end of the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">The main course
vanished from the tables and delicious looking cakes, tarts and
jellies took the place of the roast meats, vegetables and gravies.
Harry reached for a piece of treacle tart, laughing with Seamus over
a particularly amusing story involving Great Aunt Erin, a clothes peg
and a pat of butter.</p><p class="calibre8">"I mean I never
liked visiting them as a kid," said Seamus wiping away tears of
laughter. "But everything is just … better now and things are
sort of funnier." He sobered and he looked up at Harry solemnly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's like a
huge Patronus," said Dean. "It's like a huge Patronus has just
wiped away all the darkness that was hanging over everything."
Harry didn't know what to say and he just took a bite of treacle
tart, swallowing reflexively. He knew they were talking about the end
of the war and that they were trying to say it was because of him but
he didn't know how to acknowledge it or talk about it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not all of it,"
said Ginny quietly. Harry turned to look at her questioningly but she
put her head down and began playing with the chocolate cake on her
plate. Seamus and Dean went on to rib Neville about Luna but Harry's
mind whirled, his thoughts on Ginny. She did not seem all right but
it would have to wait because the Welcoming Feast in the Great Hall
on the first night of school definitely wasn't the place to find
out what was bothering her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna's
definitely good fun," Dean was saying when he pulled his mind back
to the conversation going on around him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you need to
have a bit more care than just thinking she's <em class="calibre9">fun</em>,"
snapped Hermione irritably. "Girls aren't playthings!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No one said that,
Hermione," said Seamus, narrowing his eyes. "And it'd be a
pretty poor boyfriend who thought his girlfriend<em class="calibre9"> wasn't</em>
fun!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe there are
other qualities in a girl," argued Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron thinks you're
fun," interrupted Neville. Hermione stared at him for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" she
asked stupidly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron does think
you are fun," insisted Neville. "He also knows you are smart and
kind. He's not playing with you and if he was here he'd tell us
all to shut our immature mouths."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh …" was all
Hermione said. They were silent for a while, the pudding diminishing
rapidly from the platters in front of them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna will still
be fun though," Dean said eventually and he, Seamus, Neville and
Hermione all burst out laughing. Harry smiled absently his thoughts
still on Ginny who had cut the cake into little pieces and spread
them around the plate but had not eaten any of it.</p><p class="calibre8">The chatter in the
Great Hall was rising again when Professor McGonagall stood to
address the assembled students.</p><p class="calibre8">"Before we head to
bed there are a few very important matters to address," Professor
McGonagall began. "Any students, and I do mean <em class="calibre9">any</em> students
going into the Forbidden Forest will find themselves in serious
trouble. You will <em class="calibre9">all</em> stay out of the Forbidden Forest." She
fixed a frosty look on Harry as she said this and he slouched down in
his seat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you capable
of that, Harry?" whispered Seamus with a laugh. Harry glared at him
and Seamus subsided with a smirk still gracing his features.</p><p class="calibre8">"Quidditch will be
resuming this year," said Professor McGonagall. Perhaps she would
have continued if the students had not erupted in deafening cheers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only the best
game ever!" shouted Hamish excitedly. Marjorie Smith was looking
down her nose at them, she sniffed and turned away. The excited
cheering gradually subsided, Professor McGonagall smiling patiently
the entire time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you," she
said eventually when the Hall was quiet enough to continue. "If you
are interested in trying out for Quidditch, please give your name to
your Head of House. The team captains will advise of try-outs in due
course."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who is our Head
of House?" asked Dean, looking at Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
McGonagall?" said Hermione. She sounded like she was guessing.
Harry tuned out the continuing speculation over the Gryffindor Head
of House and turned to Ginny who had not even smiled at the mention
of Quidditch. She looked extremely pale and very unsettled.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right?" he
whispered, squeezing her hand. Ginny plastered a fake smile on her
face and nodded vigorously. Harry wasn't fooled. He pulled her hand
into his own and stroked the back of it with a thumb. Ginny seemed to
sag a little against him but said nothing. Harry forced his attention
back to Professor McGonagall.</p><p class="calibre8">"- Mr Filch, our
esteemed caretaker wishes me to remind you all that performing magic
in the corridors is forbidden," she was saying. "A list of banned
products is on the wall outside his office-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I bet they all
say Weasley!" yelled a voice from the Ravenclaw table and the Great
Hall erupted in giggles except for the small sob that escaped the
girl at Harry's side. As Harry turned to her Ginny suddenly leapt
up and began running.</p><p class="calibre8">She ran the length
of the Great Hall, pushed the doors open and dashed out into the
Entrance Hall before Harry had roused himself and gotten out of his
seat. Silence blanketed the Hall as Harry tore after her. As he
reached the doors he heard Professor McGonagall say something about
new teachers but he paid no attention, instead listening intently for
a clue about where Ginny had gone. The Entrance Hall was deserted. He
was about to head up to Gryffindor Tower when Neville and Luna
appeared by his side.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think
she's up there this time?" Luna asked, her usual dreamy voice
replaced by a sharp tone Harry had never heard her use before.</p><p class="calibre8">"Doubt it,"
answered Neville. "Harry's here now. Kitchens I reckon."</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" asked
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I found Ginny in
your bed a couple times last year," answered Neville. "If it had
been a bad day, she used to sneak in some time in the night and sleep
in your bed." Harry said nothing, he hadn't noticed her dot being
in his bed, although he conceded that he hadn't often looked for
her name after she'd seemed tucked safely in bed for the night.</p><p class="calibre8">"So why the
kitchens?" he asked Neville as the three of them turned in that
direction. He felt helpless and angry with himself that he didn't
know why Ginny had fled or where she had gone.</p><p class="calibre8">"She never said,"
replied Neville, "but I'm pretty sure Dobby used to feed her
chocolate cake when she was feeling particularly low. She disappeared
a couple of times when things got too much and we always found her in
your bed or the kitchens."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't know,"
said Harry helplessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's okay,
Harry," said Luna. "You couldn't know, you weren't here."</p><p class="calibre8">But Ginny was not in
the kitchens. Luna headed back to her Common Room after a rather
sickening display of saying goodnight to Neville and the two of them
headed back to Gryffindor Tower. Neither Harry nor Neville knew the
password and it took a heated argument with The Fat Lady to get
through the portrait hole.</p><p class="calibre8">Students milled
around the Common Room and the WWN was playing quietly from a set in
the corner. The fire crackled merrily and the familiar armchairs and
couches seemed warm and inviting. Ginny was not sitting in any of
them however. Hermione came down the dormitory stairs after having
shown the new girls their dormitories. She shook her head when Harry
asked if she had seen Ginny there. There was no sign of Ginny in
Gryffindor Tower beyond the trunk waiting for her at the end of her
bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Room of
Requirement?" asked Neville softly. Without another word Harry and
Hermione left the Common Room. The walk to the tapestry of Barnabas
the Barmy was tense and silent until Hermione spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why do you think
she left like that?" she asked. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know,"
he said. "She was jittery for a while before that, too. She
wouldn't tell me what was wrong."</p><p class="calibre8">"I expect
something triggered her," Hermione shrugged as they reached the
tapestry. "You weren't here; you couldn't recognise it – Oh!"
She broke off, staring at the scorched tapestry and the blackened
wall opposite it. Harry pushed down his annoyance at being told again
that he hadn't been here.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think it
still works?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only one way to
find out," Hermione began pacing in front of the tapestry as she
spoke. The wall did not respond. It just sat there, blackened and
silent. Harry tried, pacing three times while asking for the place
where Ginny was.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course if
Ginny's not there, asking for her won't work of course," mused
Hermione. She began pacing again. "I need a room to study, I need a
room to study, I need a room to study." The wall remained, stoic
and impossibly unmoving.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's
broken," said Harry. "Well at least she's not in there if it
doesn't work. How am I supposed to find her? Why would she run off
like that?" He knew he sounded desperate and his voice was rising
to a whine but he couldn't help it. He was consumed with worry and
an underlying anger that he didn't know Ginny well enough to know
where she was. A repeating mantra was lurking in the background; he'd
not been there last year so he wouldn't know.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Hermione
returned slowly to Gryffindor Tower. They were almost at the portrait
of The Fat Lady when Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry's arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"How is it that we
are so stupid?" she hissed and began to run. "Come on!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" yelped
Harry as she dragged him along.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Marauder's
Map!" Hermione said breathlessly. "Why haven't we been looking
at the map? Where is it?" Harry gave himself a mental slap on the
forehead. He'd even thought about the map earlier but it had not
occurred to him to use it.</p><p class="calibre8">"In my trunk,"
he said as they both ran full tilt towards the Portrait. "Okay, let
us in." He snapped at The Fat Lady. The lady in question looked him
up and down and then turned her nose up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You were
incredibly rude to me before," she said haughtily. "And you still
don't know the password. I do not think I shall let you in at all."
Harry gritted his teeth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry about
that," he said. "Dreadfully sorry; now, could we get in please?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry Potter,"
added Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">What</em>?"
Harry asked peevishly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, that's the
password," Hermione looked at him apologetically. Harry rolled his
eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said The
Fat Lady. "You can go in dear, but <em class="calibre9">he</em> can't until he
apologises for his outrageous display earlier."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry Potter,"
Harry ground out between clenched teeth. "And I'm not
apologising. If the password is Harry Potter and I'm bloody <em class="calibre9">Harry
Potter</em> why should I have to say it?" The Fat Lady clearly
didn't think much of his apology and began screeching at him about
not respecting her person and other things about honour and chivalry
that he didn't really understand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just let me in!"
Harry shouted just as the portrait hole swung open. He scrambled
through into a deathly silence.</p><p class="calibre8">"What was that all
about?" asked Neville from the middle of the room, where he was
staring at the portrait hole. The rest of the students seemed to be
sitting as still and as quiet as Harry had ever seen them.</p><p class="calibre8">"She wouldn't
let me in and we had a bit of an argument about my … behaviour
before," said Harry grumpily. He started towards the boys'
dormitory before he stopped and looked around at his housemates.
"What's wrong with this lot?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We heard shouting
from the other side of the portrait hole," said Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"It scared
people," added Dennis Creevey.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not the first
time someone's had an argument with her," said Harry his brows
knitted together.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes well, we've
kind of gotten used to shouting meaning there was a Death Eater on
the other side trying to get in," answered Romilda Vane quietly.
Harry gazed around at the pale faces watching him. A few first years
including Gilbert and Dexter sat near the fire. They looked less
scared and merely mildly curious as if they did not really understand
what they were supposed to be scared about. Gerald sat in a corner,
scowling at the room in general.</p><p class="calibre8">"She used to go
and get Sir Cadogan," Seamus started. "He helped her keep the
Carrows out but she nearly got hexed once and McGonagall had to
repair her portrait at least six times when they slashed it in
frustration. We were trapped in the Common Room for three hours the
last time."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh …" was all
Harry said. Underneath his calm exterior his frustration and anger
were growing. He turned to go up to go and get the map. Harry didn't
realise how tightly his nerves were strung until Jimmy Peakes spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay you
weren't here, you didn't know."</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop saying
that!" Harry exploded, turning rapidly on the stairs. "Everybody
stop saying that! I know I wasn't here, okay! I wasn't here; I
don't know the half of it. I get it! Just stop saying it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry …"
Neville's voice trailed off into the silence</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?" Harry
heard Gilbert squeak as he turned to go up the stairs. "<em class="calibre9">Harry
Potter</em>?" Harry thought Othello may have answered him but he
wasn't sure and he didn't much care. He stomped up to his dorm
room each thud of his feet on the steps satisfyingly loud in the
echoing stairwell. He was just opening his trunk when a frantic
tapping on the window drew his attention. Liberty was perched outside
his dormitory window, a scrap of parchment attached to her leg.</p><p class="calibre8">She looked like
Hedwig, perched out there on the other side of the window. Harry felt
a momentary pang of loss as he opened the window and Liberty hopped
inside.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey girl, is that
a letter for me?" Liberty had not brought Harry a letter before but
she seemed to sense the importance of the job as she puffed up her
feathers importantly. Harry reached out and retrieved the letter.
Liberty pecked his hand affectionately before flying out the still
open window. Harry unfurled the loosely scrolled letter and
recognised Hagrid's untidy scrawl.</p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Harry, I found
Ginny'</em> was all it said. Harry snatched his invisibility cloak
and the map from his trunk and without stopping to put the cloak on
and with the parchment still clutched in his hand, Harry tore down
the stairs and through the common room.</p><p class="calibre8">He heard Hermione
and Neville call after him and vaguely registered Gerald say
something triumphantly about Harry Potter not being six feet tall but
ignored them all as he scrambled through the portrait hole. He pelted
down corridors and staircases, anxious to get down to Hagrid, hoping
with everything he had that Ginny was still safe with Hagrid by the
time he got there.</p>
