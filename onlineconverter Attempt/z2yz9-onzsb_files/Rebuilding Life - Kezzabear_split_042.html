			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
42. All I Want For Christmas Is You</strong></p><p class="calibre8">"George?" Ron
called as he and Harry staggered into the tiny church in Ottery St
Catchpole with a flower arrangement bigger than them.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think that goes
… maybe up the front?" George shrugged and Ron and Harry
staggered up to the altar, dropping the flower arrangement on top of
it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why are we doing
this in a church anyway?" Charlie asked plaintively as he struggled
to reattach an enormous bow to one of the pews</p><p class="calibre8">"Angie's family
wanted it in a church and … well they're a bit … she wanted to
keep them happy anyway," George said. "We couldn't find one
but Perce told us the church here was still booked for today so …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I really do wish
Penelope had been more prompt with things but, in hindsight it was a
fortuitous oversight," Percy said as he hurried up the aisle with a
gigantic candlestick. "Now, where are the seating plans?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The what?"
George asked blankly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seating plans,"
Percy said patiently, "so that we can seat everybody."</p><p class="calibre8">"Doesn't matter
where people sit," George said, wandering up to the altar at the
front of the church and idly fiddling with the gigantic flower
arrangement. He stared unseeing at the flowers a faint frown on his
face.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's getting
married in an hour and a half," said Ron. "It'd be good if he
had a smile on his face."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not that
he's not happy," Charlie added as he leaned against a pew. "He
is … it's just …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Is he still hung
over?" asked Percy briskly. He was ticking things off on his piece
of parchment and his face was a tightly controlled mask, devoid of
emotion.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said Ron.
"I'm the only one who's hung over since you greedy gits left me
only half a dose."</p><p class="calibre8">"S'what you get
for getting out of bed last," Charlie grinned at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up," Ron
muttered. He winced as a shrill voice pierced the air.</p><p class="calibre8">"What iare/i
you boys doing?" Molly called as she bustled into the chapel. "I
sent you down here to make sure the decorations were in place! What
are you playing at, standing around doing nothing? You should be
getting dressed! We don't have a lot of time!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Charlie, you need
a haircut!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on, we've
got time. I can do it now. I can't believe we didn't do this
yesterday!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum, I don't
need a haircut," Charlie protested. Molly huffed exasperatedly and
strode over to Bill. She flicked her wand at the flower arrangement
setting it on a plinth to the left hand side.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now, why didn't
we think of levitating it?" Ron sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you still
wearing that earring? I thought I told you to take it out?" Molly
said to Bill, hands on her hips.</p><p class="calibre8">"I always wear
it," Bill grumbled mutinously.</p><p class="calibre8">"George, dear,"
Molly said, ignoring Bill's response entirely. "Your father
brought your robes; they're in that little dressing room the vicar
showed us to last week. You really should go and get changed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum," George
complained, "it's ages until the wedding if I get dressed now
I'll just get dirty or something."</p><p class="calibre8">"Nonsense,"
Molly said briskly. "You aren't two years old any more. Off you
go!" She turned George around and prodded him towards the aisle.
Molly followed closely behind, beaming at Percy. He was the only one
of them already dressed for the wedding and she stopped to brush
invisible lint from his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everything's in
place, mother," Percy said. "Do try not to worry."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're such a
good boy," Molly murmured patting him on the arm, "and holding up
so beautifully." Percy looked pained and began scribbling furiously
on his parchment. Molly, oblivious to his discomfort turned to Harry
and eyed his hair for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"No … it doesn't
ever lie flat," Harry said. Molly smiled and shook her head
ruefully before turning to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" Ron
asked belligerently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing dear,"
Molly said patiently. "It's just you look a bit peaky. I wondered
if you wanted me to fetch some more potion for you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum, you're the
best," Ron breathed. Molly smiled and patted him on the cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now, off you go,"
Molly said as she motioned to George, fluttering her hands in the
direction of the vestibule where the little dressing room was
located. "Bill, you go with him."</p><p class="calibre8">"He doesn't need
a minder, Mum," Bill protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just …"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's all right,
Mum," George said gently, kissing her cheek. "I'm okay. Stop
worrying about me." They watched as George went to get dressed, the
door to the dressing room clicked shut behind him and Molly sagged,
looking worn and tired.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why does he think
I can stop worrying?" she asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"He'll be fine,"
Bill said putting his arm around her shoulder. "I think … I think
we just have to get used to the fact that … he's never going to
be the same but he will be all right. He's got Angie now and …
they need each other."</p><p class="calibre8">"Such a lovely
girl," Molly muttered, brushing a tear from her own cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"She is," Bill
said, "and she'll look after him, they'll look after each
other."</p><p class="calibre8">"He is happy,
isn't he?" Molly almost pleaded with her oldest son.</p><p class="calibre8">"He is," Bill
nodded. "They both are, well … as much as they can be."</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been so
worried about him," Molly confessed. "He was very excited when he
told us about the baby-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Were you?"
Charlie asked with a smirk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course!"
Molly replied indignantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
he got up the guts to tell her after the conversation we had about …
propriety," Harry muttered to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Was this before
or after you and Ginny …" Ron trailed off and grimaced. Harry
stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you two
muttering about?" Charlie asked quietly as Bill reassured their
mother.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry's sex
life," Ron whispered. Charlie eyed Harry intently and Harry felt
the heat creep up his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up," he
hissed at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are so lucky
this is a church and we can't beat you up," Charlie said with a
smirk. Harry tried to ignore their sniggering, crossing his arms over
his chest and glaring.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's just so …
he's very up and down," Molly sighed. "Just when I think he's
moving on something makes him so angry-"</p><p class="calibre8">At that moment the
conversation was cut off by a slamming door and raised voices from
the vestibule.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just say it,
Dad!" George shouted. "Say his NAME!"</p><p class="calibre8">"George …"
Arthur's voice was quiet, pleading.</p><p class="calibre8">"SAY IT!"</p><p class="calibre8">"There's no need
to upset yourself," Arthur said, but he got no further as George
came striding into the chapel; he was half dressed in a pair of smart
looking trousers, his feet and chest bare.</p><p class="calibre8">"ONE OF YOU, SAY
HIS NAME!" He was shaking, his fists clenched and his face red with
anger.</p><p class="calibre8">"George …"
Charlie said helplessly. Arthur stood behind him looking troubled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I want … I just
want …" George's fury was fading fast and he slumped a little,
looking at Charlie with pleading, tearful eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can tell us,"
Ron said gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not
mental," George said, turning to Ron, talking only to him. "I
know he's gone and … he can't be here …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ron
said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I want him here,"
George whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know."</p><p class="calibre8">"No one ever talks
about him!" George said suddenly. "No one says his name! How can
Fred be here, be a part of it, if everyone's ignoring he ever
existed?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No one's
ignoring Fred," Ron said. "We just … we don't know what to
say."</p><p class="calibre8">"He should
ibe/i here," George said angrily. "He's
supposed to ibe/i here. He's supposed to rib me
about getting a ball and chain and he's supposed to fill our
suitcases with Filibuster's or sew my underwear shut or slip Canary
Creams into the wedding cake."</p><p class="calibre8">"No one is
regretting missing all that more than Fred," Ron said, a grin
twitching at the corners of his lips. "And when you curse us for
doing it he'll be sitting up there complaining we stole his
thunder."</p><p class="calibre8">"You haven't,"
George was fighting his own grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't know
that," Ron said with a smug smile. George looked at him for a long
moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"And he's
supposed to … he's supposed to be my best man."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know he was,"
Ron said, the grin fading. He paused for a moment. "We would …
any of us would …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I – I just …
I can't," George said. He was pleading with them to understand.
Ron opened his mouth to say something but was cut off by Ginny
stomping into the church, shaking the snow out of her perfectly
coiffed hair and scowling viciously.</p><p class="calibre8">She was the
loveliest creature Harry had ever seen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Unbelievable,"
she said. "I cannot believe I have to put up with iher/i!
Of all the … George! Aren't you dressed yet? Honestly, we can't
trust you to – is that a itattoo/i?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Uncanny,"
George said shaking his head. "It's like a little mini-Mum."
Ginny stalked over to George, peering at his left shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," she said
softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a
Hippogriff," he said. "His name's Gred." As he turned, Harry
saw the tattoo of a grey Hippogriff flying in circles on George's
left shoulder blade.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's … he's
very cool," Ginny said, smiling, her eyes glistened a little with
unshed tears.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what has got
you all in a twist, little Ginnikins?" George asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I just …"
Ginny trailed off as she looked around the room and caught sight of
Bill. "Nothing, it doesn't matter." She smiled brightly but
Harry wasn't fooled and neither was George.</p><p class="calibre8">"What did she do
now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't even
know who I'm talking about!" Ginny retorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can guess,"
George argued. "Mum's in here, so it's not her and Hermione's
gone to help the Muggles over at Angie's. There are no other women
except Fleur because Charlie here obviously has more of a thing for
dragons-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!" Charlie
said. "I'll have you know that Sylvana is perfectly human!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh really?"
George leered at his older brother. "Sylvana hey? First we've
heard of her!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What has Fleur
done now?" Bill interrupted with a heavy sigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've got a
houseguest," Ginny turned to him, accusing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I know, she
arrived today," Bill said, puzzled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only you're
staying with us tonight so she's iour/i
houseguest," Ginny glared at her older brother.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Which means
she'll have to stay in imy/i room!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oooh, a kink in
your plans, Harry?" Charlie asked with a smirk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut iup/i!"
Harry hissed. Everyone turned to look at him and Ginny raised an
eyebrow before shaking her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fleur wanted to
help her family out," Bill said. "Mum said it's all right if
she stays and George said it's okay if she comes to the wedding-"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's a
nightmare!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really, Ginny,"
Bill said, "she's a perfectly lovely kid. Fleur got to know her
older sister, Pearl, when she was here for the Tournament and she
just wanted to help them out. She hasn't got anywhere to go for
Christmas and with their parents … gone and Pearl in Asia with her
new husband-"</p><p class="calibre8">"You mean I have
to put up with her all Christmas?" Ginny screeched.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think you're
overreacting," Bill said. "Audrey is a perfectly lovely girl."
Harry couldn't help it, he sniggered. Ginny turned on him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, you can
laugh," she said, scowling. Harry attempted to school his features
into a look of proper concern but he was aware that he was smirking.
Ginny huffed at him and turned away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's Audrey?"
Charlie asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only the most
talkative witch on earth," Ginny said. "She will chew my ear off
about anything. Seamus she won't speak to, but me … ugh, she
wants to be my friend and she thinks talking to me about the proper
way to shine my shoes will accomplish that!"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's very
important to shine your shoes in the correct manner," Percy said
absently, marking something on his parchment. "It's always
important to apply the polish in a circular motion and buff them when
you've finished. It gives a better finish. I say George, did you
shine your shoes?" Ginny just looked at Percy and shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"She already wants
to sit with me during the wedding," Ginny whined. "She thinks we
are going to be the best of friends! This is going to be unbearable.
I'm not going back there, I'm staying here. If I have to listen
to one more conversation about hair curling charms I will curl
something – and it won't be her hair!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, if you're
going to stay," George said, reaching into his pocket, "make
yourself useful." He tossed her a small red box. Ginny snatched it
out of the air.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's this?"
she asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"The rings,"
George replied as he turned and went back to the dressing room.
"Don't lose 'em. That Audrey can't sit next to you if you're
standing up the front." He shut the door behind him and Ginny
stared at the box in her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"What …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I think he just
asked you to be his best man," Ron said, amused.</p><p class="calibre8">"But I'm a
girl!"</p><p class="calibre8">"So Harry tells
us," Ron replied with a grin. Ginny blushed spectacularly and
glared at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't tell
them anything," Harry growled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, all right
then," Molly said briskly. "Percy, you stay here and wait for the
guests. Ginny … oh I suppose you had better stay with George and
Arthur. The rest of you, back home this minute and get dressed."
Percy bent industriously over his parchment and then eyed one of the
flower arrangements, shaking his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"There is much to
do," he murmured and hurried to the arrangement purposefully.
Arthur followed Molly to the door of the church, whispering quietly
to her. Ginny hovered uncertainly outside the door of the dressing
room and Harry lingered for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"George is
completely mental," Ginny muttered. "What can he possibly be
thinking? I can't be a best iman/i!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … be a
best woman then," Harry replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"I suppose …"
Ginny said doubtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just … let me
talk to him for a moment?" Harry bent to press a chaste kiss to her
lips. Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry pulled from
her grasp and knocked on the dressing room door. There was no answer.
Harry pushed the door open. George was sitting on a chair, his head
bowed and a pair of socks dangling from his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can I … can I
come in?" Harry asked tentatively. George sniffed. Harry, taking
that as a yes, shut the door behind him with a soft click.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
he's not here," George said suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Those we love
never really leave us," Harry said softly. George jerked his head
up.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The people we
love are a part of us, they never really leave us," Harry said
softly. "Fred is … he's right here." Harry tapped his chest,
over his heart. "You can't blame other people for not remembering
Fred … you have to let iyourself/i feel."</p><p class="calibre8">"I iam/i
feeling!" George cried. "I'm feeling nervous and anxious and
like I bollixed things up and like I'm not good enough for Angie
and … and like … and like …" George trailed off, his fist
clenched, the socks dangling limply from each one.</p><p class="calibre8">"But you're not
feeling Fred," Harry said simply. "You're trying to make the
rest of us do that for you. He's here, he's a part of every one
of us but we can't make you feel him. You have to do that."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't,"
George ground out. "He'd be … I made such a mess of things.
iI'm/i a mess! And … she was his girl."
George's voice faded to a whisper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop feeling
guilty," Harry said. "If Fred had a problem with what was going
on, don't you think he'd have found a way to hex you by now? Besides,
I've seen you together. You're ihappy/i when
you're with her."</p><p class="calibre8">"She helps me
forget … and remember …" George said. Harry waited. "She
helps me forget I'm alone and she … she gets it, you know. We cry
sometimes – when we remember. She misses him too and then I hold
her and kiss her and we tell stories and then … we forget … we
forget that it's painful."</p><p class="calibre8">"Then look after
her," Harry said shrugging. "She probably doesn't want to see
you crying at your wedding, you know?" George snorted before he
sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's here,"
Harry said softly, "trust me."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," George
sighed, "but … I couldn't have anyone replace him. Not even
Lee. It would just … am I mad to ask Ginny to stand up with me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe," Harry
replied, "but iyou/i can get away with it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Think she'll do
it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's waiting
outside," Harry said. "I'll send her in."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks, Harry,"
George whispered. Harry nodded and slipped quietly out of the
dressing room. He saw Ginny standing in the vestibule, gazing up at a
stained glass window, the light reflecting in a multicoloured rainbow
off her hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"You look
beautiful," Harry said softly. Ginny spun around, smiling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
nodded. He slipped his arms around her waist and pulled her close.
"George … needs you. I have to go but I'll see you later."
His heart beat erratically in his chest as Ginny's hands rested on
his shoulders lightly. He bent his head to kiss her softly and she
wound her hands into his hair and pulled him close, nudging his mouth
open and curling her tongue around his. Harry's hands roamed up
Ginny's back and tangled in her hair and he felt like he was
floating.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi! Potter!"
Ron called from the steps of the church. "Do that later!" Harry
crashed back to earth scowling at Ron who just grinned. Harry rolled
his eyes as Ginny giggled. He pulled away from her reluctantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
later," Harry said, squeezing her hand one last time and he stepped
out into the blustery weather. Ron, Bill and Charlie were waiting on
the steps for him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Must you kiss her
all the time?" Ron asked, shaking his head. Shoulders hunched
against the cold, Harry just grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are so lucky
it's too cold to beat you up," Charlie said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen, forget
about all that," Ron said urgently. "We have to do something."</p><p class="calibre8">"Can we talk about
it somewhere warm?" complained Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, you can go
somewhere warm," Ron said. "You and Bill go and get Angelina's
luggage and charm them shut or something, I don't know, be
creative. Me and Harry'll go to the shop and grab some Canary
Creams and a few other necessary items."</p><p class="calibre8">"We're pranking
him?" Bill asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"We have to,"
Ron said, "or Fred will never forgive us!" Bill grinned and
Charlie shook his head in resignation.</p><p class="calibre8">"C'mon,
Charlie," Bill said. "I can't wait to get back the little
blighter for the singing confetti!" Charlie raised his eyebrow at
that but said nothing and the two of them Disapparated on the spot.</p><p class="calibre8">*************</p><p class="calibre8">At half past three,
when Harry, Ron and Hermione arrived for the wedding they found Ginny
and George talking to some of the guests in the church. Harry watched
as Ginny smiled at some people who could only be Angelina's family.
She held George's hand in her own and it was obvious to anyone who
knew them both that she was his lifeline at that moment. Ginny's
laughter rang through the church and George smiled at her but it
didn't reach his eyes. Ginny kept greeting the guests, laughing and
joking with them. George followed her almost silently.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's more like
Fred than any of us," said Bill from behind them. "I hope he's
all right …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I am sure 'ee
weel be fine," Fleur said softly. Harry turned around to see Audrey
beaming at him. He smiled weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good afternoon,
Harry," Audrey said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm, hi," Harry
answered and was prevented from further speech by Audrey suddenly
running at conversation like a freight train.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just
wonderful!" she gushed. "I never thought in a million
iyears/i that I'd be spending Christmas with you
all. And this is so fabulous, a wedding! They are such wonderful,
romantic events! I hope I'm dressed all right. I do so like to look
my best. You're looking very handsome, I must say and … who is
your friend? This must be one of Ginny's big brothers. I've heard
so much about you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm, um …
Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, wonderful!"
Audrey stepped towards Ron and extended a perfectly manicured hand.
Ron shook it perfunctorily.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've seen me
before … at Hogwarts," said Ron, raising his eyebrow at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably with
me," Hermione interrupted, laying a possessive hand on Ron's arm.
Audrey eyed Hermione for a moment before she turned to look at the
church.</p><p class="calibre8">"Such lovely
flowers," she said. "Whoever chose them must have simply
exquisite taste."</p><p class="calibre8">"That would be
me," Percy said. He seemed to have come out of nowhere, which was
entirely possible, his efficient clipboard held in front of him like
a shield.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well they are
just delightful," Audrey said, offering Percy her hand. "I'm
Audrey, very pleased to meet you." Percy eyed her hand for a moment
before obviously deciding it would be the height of impropriety to
refuse the handshake and he brought his hand out from behind his
clipboard to grasp her hand in his.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy," he
said, swallowing hard and Harry noticed his handshake lingered a
little longer than was strictly necessary.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know Ginny from
school," Audrey said brightly, unaware of the flush creeping up
Percy's neck. "I think my sister knows you … from a study
group. Oh, I know! You were Head Boy in second year!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah … yes … I
was, er, Head Boy in Ginny's second year," Percy said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's
lovely to see you again, just lovely," Audrey said. Her gaze
lingered at the front of the church where George and Ginny were
standing, talking to the little wizard officiator. "I must confess,
I don't really know anyone and I was going to sit with Ginny, but
it seems … well, is she standing up with George? That's rather …
unconventional."</p><p class="calibre8">"So is George,"
said Percy wryly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, he and Fred
were rather hard to miss," Audrey said, not noticing the shadow
that crossed Percy's face and the way Ron shifted uneasily. "You
didn't have to be a Gryffindor to notice those two."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, so you're
not a Gryffindor then?" Percy asked, seizing on the topic that had
nothing to do with Fred.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no, I'm a
Ravenclaw," Audrey said, smiling. "I say, I think they are ready
to start, shouldn't we go and sit down?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, yes, right,
sorry," Percy moved his clipboard a little higher as Audrey tilted
her head slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you sitting
with anyone Percy?" she asked. Percy shook his head wordlessly.
"Oh, wonderful! You can sit with me!"</p><p class="calibre8">Ron and Harry
watched with amusement as Audrey plucked the clipboard from Percy's
grasp and set it carefully on the back pew before she slipped an arm
through his. Percy, his face a brilliant red, showed Audrey to a seat
before slipping into the pew beside her.</p><p class="calibre8">"She has set her
sights on him," Bill murmured as he and Fleur made their way to the
front.</p><p class="calibre8">"He seems all
right with it," Ron muttered as they followed.</p><p class="calibre8">Sliding into the
pews, Harry looked up at George and Ginny. Ginny was talking
animatedly to her brother and he was smiling slightly. Ginny reached
up and smoothed his hair before she straightened the collar of his
wedding robes. Predominantly yellow in colour, they made Harry think
of Luna although the shimmering fabric and fine embroidery on them
indicated they were probably African made.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny turned and
gave Harry a wink. He smiled up at her. She looked just as beautiful
as she had at Bill and Fleur's wedding. The thick cloak and boots
she had been encased in when she arrived at the church were gone. She
wore a dark green dress that floated around her legs and her hair was
piled on top of her head, exposing her slim neck. Harry leaned
forward, his chin on his hand as he watched her. She and George had
their heads bent together in a conspiratorial manner. She laughed and
Harry felt his heart jump in his chest at the sound of it.</p><p class="calibre8">Organ music began to
swell somewhere from above them and Harry followed the rest of the
assembled guests as they turned to watch Molly and Arthur as they
walked down the aisle together. Molly was already clutching her white
lacy handkerchief and sniffling, but her eyes shone with pride as
well as tears and she hugged George before she sat down. Everybody
stood up as the music changed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Last chance,"
Ginny said audibly, "ball and chain or bust." She sounded
uncannily like Fred and Ron snorted inelegantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny!" Molly
hissed as nervous laughter broke out.</p><p class="calibre8">George's face
broke out into a wide grin, the first real smile anyone had seen on
his face all day.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's do it,"
he said and then all eyes, including his, were on Angelina as she
walked up the aisle with her parents.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">The occupants of the
Burrow lazed around listlessly. Bill and Fleur were snogging in a
corner of the living room, Ron and Hermione were bickering quietly in
front of the fire and Molly and Arthur swayed slowly in a revolving
circle in the middle of the room while Celestina Warbeck warbled from
the wireless. Several empty eggnog cups were scattered across the
room and a half eaten plate of mince pies sat haphazardly amongst the
yellow feathers on the coffee table. Charlie was idly munching on one
of them as he gazed at Harry and Ginny huddled together in one of the
big squashy arm chairs.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry rubbed Ginny's
feet absently, the heels she had been wearing all day in a heap on
the floor. Ron grumbled something to Hermione and swiftly kissed her
to silence her tirade about his ability to cram three mince pies in
his mouth at once.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm a growing
boy," Ron mumbled as he pulled Hermione closer, "and … Mum made
them. I've just come back from being chained up in a tomb; you'd
think I'd get a little more sympathy …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, you poor
baby," Hermione crooned.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's more
like it," Ron said, a self-satisfied smirk on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's late and I
should get going home to my parents," Hermione said, sighing
heavily. "I promised them I'd be there Christmas morning."</p><p class="calibre8">"You will be here
later, won't you dear?" Molly asked, her eyes closed and a dreamy
smile on her face.</p><p class="calibre8">"I already
promised Gilbert I'd see him at Sirius House," Hermione nodded,
"so I'll see you just after breakfast."</p><p class="calibre8">"It was a lovely
wedding, wasn't it?" Molly asked suddenly. "You did so well,
Ginny dear."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not bad for
someone who had no warning," Ginny said. "I'm glad I don't
have to be anyone's best man ever again."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who says?" Ron
said. "Maybe you can be mine. That was a corker of a speech!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No way," Ginny
said, shaking her head emphatically. "That's Harry's job …
unless Hermione wants him for a bridesmaid."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!" Harry's
voice joined both Ron and Hermione's in protest and Ginny just
giggled madly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can you just
imagine Auntie Muriel's face?" said Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"Speaking of
decrepit relatives," Ron said, ignoring his mother's disapproving
frown, "I didn't think Angelina's great uncle was ever going to
leave!"</p><p class="calibre8">"He was having too
much fun chasing that mistletoe," Bill said, his arms still firmly
around Fleur's waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"I still can't
believe he asked for a Canary Cream," Charlie chuckled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wish that piece
of the cake hadn't gone to Angelina's father," Molly sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"He was a good
sport about it," Ron protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"If you call
hexing George being a good sport!" Bill retorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was just a
little hex …" Charlie said.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was actually
kinda funny," Ron said, "giving him two left feet and casting
iTarantallegra/i." Charlie snorted and Ginny
sniggered.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what did you
do to their suitcases anyway?" Ginny asked Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh … just a few
little tricks I discovered-"</p><p class="calibre8">There was a loud
crack and suddenly a very iblue/i George, sporting
purple hair and smoking eyebrows was standing, shirtless in the
middle of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oops … I didn't
mean to do anything to your eyebrows," Bill said, trying to keep a
straight face.</p><p class="calibre8">"So it was you,"
George said, hands on his hips.</p><p class="calibre8">"Guilty," Bill
said with a grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"The singing,
edible underwear?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Charlie."</p><p class="calibre8">"The love potion
laced chocolate cauldrons?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry."</p><p class="calibre8">"The flashing,
neon newlyweds sign?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't tell me
the belching toiletries were Percy's idea?" George raised an
eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, dear,"
replied Molly. "That was me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum!" Bill
exclaimed. George stared at her and Charlie laughed out loud. Molly
shrugged and winked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you sure
you're all right, George?" Arthur asked. George nodded wordlessly
before he threw himself at Bill and hugged him. Fleur got caught up
in it and ineffectually patted at George's still smoking eyebrows.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just wanted to
say thanks," George said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No problem,"
Bill said, ruffling the purple hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"All of you,"
George said turning around. "I – I couldn't have made it
through the day without you and … and I'm sorry I said you were
ignoring Fred. I know it's … it's not easy but … thanks."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, Georgie,"
Molly said, engulfing him in a hug. He hugged her back and then he
gave them all a crooked little grin and a wink.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd better get
back to my wife," he said, his chest puffed out a little with pride
at the words. "I think she was planning to open the champagne and …
well …." George Disapparated with a loud crack, leaving behind a
small plume of smoke from his eyebrows.</p><p class="calibre8">"I do not zink he
is expecting what Percy did to zee champagne …" Fleur said idly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy?" Bill
raised his eyebrows at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I saw 'eem
doing something to ze champagne we gave zem to take," Fleur
explained.</p><p class="calibre8">"Doing something?"
Ron seemed to be exploring the words as if the notion was foreign,
which it probably was if it involved Percy playing a prank.</p><p class="calibre8">"I said to 'eem,
what have you done?" Fleur giggled. "But I do not know what 'ee
has done. 'Ee would not tell me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Where is Percy
anyway?" Charlie asked, summoning another mince pie lazily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Haven't seen
him in some time," Arthur answered.</p><p class="calibre8">"He finally left
me alone once I gave that speech," Ginny sighed. "Audrey stopped
pestering me about three hours ago. Maybe they are off somewhere
plotting to drive me mad?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe they are
off somewhere …" Charlie said, a slow grin stealing across his
features. He got to his feet and padded to the kitchen door
stealthily. He listened at the door for a moment. "I can't hear
anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't even
know if they are in there," Ron scoffed. Charlie pushed the door
open and poked his head around.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," he said.
"They're in there." He beckoned Ron to the door. Grumbling, Ron
lumbered to his feet and pushed the door open to peer into the
kitchen. The expression on his face when he turned around was
priceless.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're …
he's … she's ikissing/i him!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" asked
Bill. Ron nodded. Ginny leapt to her feet suddenly, pulling Harry
with her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't believe
this," she said. "Let me see." Bill followed them and they both
peered into the kitchen. Harry was unable to see past them but he
didn't even try. The look on Ginny's face afterwards was
thunderous.</p><p class="calibre8">"It actually looks
like he's kissing her," Bill said dispassionately. They pulled
their heads back and let the door swing shut silently.</p><p class="calibre8">"That little …"
Ginny floundered for words. "She … why … that's just …
she's …"</p><p class="calibre8">"A scarlet woman?"
Ron grinned at her and Ginny scowled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Going to make my
life a misery," she grumbled. "I'm going to bed." She stomped
over to collect her shoes and began muttering. "Can't believe she
has to stay in imy/i room tonight, better not follow
me … I'll hex anyone who comes in there …" Ginny kissed Harry
on the cheek perfunctorily and stomped up the stairs muttering the
whole time. Her family watched her, bemused.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hear that,
Potter?" Charlie said. "She'll hex ianyone/i
who goes in there …" Harry rolled his eyes while Ron sniggered.</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">When Harry awoke on
Christmas morning it was not, as he expected, to the soft kisses of a
certain red-head. Instead he was subjected to the excited bouncing of
a much larger, louder one. Harry pulled his pillow over his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"C'mon Harry!"
said Ron excitedly. "Get up, it's Christmas and there's
presents!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Go'way,"
Harry mumbled from under his pillow. He'd slept in George's old
room, no – he'd slept in his own room – and had been having a
rather lovely dream without the background of snoring that usually
accompanied his dreams when he slept in the same room as Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are such a
lazybones," Ron muttered, pulling Harry's bedclothes off and
snatching his pillow. Harry rolled over and moaned, squinting up at
Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"How early is it
anyway?" Harry snapped, grabbing at the bedclothes now tangled
around his legs.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's only a few
minutes before six," Ron said, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
"C'mon. If we don't hurry there won't be time for breakfast
before we go to see the kids."</p><p class="calibre8">"Fine," Harry
grumbled and gave up trying to pull the blankets back up to his neck,
letting his head fall back on the mattress with a thud. He jumped as
something soft and crinkly landed on his chest with a soft thump.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hurry up, put it
on, let's go!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry raised his
head to look at the lumpy package on his chest. He felt a smile tug
at his mouth when he realised it was his Weasley jumper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Breakfast," Ron
whined from the doorway. Harry laughed and scrambled off the bed,
tearing open the parcel and pulling out a soft, green jumper that he
pulled over his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"How do I look?"
Harry asked, throwing his arms wide and smirking.</p><p class="calibre8">"You look stupid,"
Ron said flatly. "It doesn't match your pyjamas and your hair's
a mess."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why don't you
go down and I'll meet you there," Harry said, laughing. "Let me
get properly dressed, yeah?" Ron grumbled but retreated. Harry
heard him stomping down the stairs as he pulled the jumper off and
began searching for shirt and a pair of trousers. He had managed to
get as far as his shirt and trousers and was pulling his jumper back
on when he heard a soft voice from the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, still
wrapping my present I see?" Ginny said. Harry smiled as she came
inside.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was just about
to put myself under the tree."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no, you
don't," Ginny said. "That's one present I need to open …
elsewhere. You should put it on my pillow." She smirked.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think I can
manage that …" Harry bent his head to kiss her and she slid her
arms around his neck. "Happy Christmas," he breathed against her
lips as he pulled her close. She tasted of mint and smelled like
flowers and Harry was dimly aware of a groan as he wound his fingers
into her hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum's holding
breakfast, waiting for you!" Ron's grumpy voice broke through. "I
thought you were coming down, not snogging up here. It's probably a
good thing I came up when I did. Who knows what else you might get up
to-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron," Ginny
said warningly, giving her brother a cold look. Ron glared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah … erm
Merry Christmas," said Harry into the frosty silence. "Breakfast
…" Ron just grunted and turned to head down the stairs. Harry
turned to Ginny who was scowling at Ron's retreating back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Git," she
muttered decisively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, Ginny, did I
miss something?" Harry asked slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's been in my
ear about … never mind," Ginny said with a sigh. She plastered a
smile on her face and tugged on Harry's hand. "Let's go down
for breakfast. Mum said we can open our presents before we go to
Sirius House."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry followed Ginny
downstairs, frowning at the back of her head. Audrey was sitting at
one end of the table, dressed impeccably in a blinding white cardigan
with her hands folded neatly in her lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"Merry Christmas
dears," Molly sang as she levitated a plate of bacon towards the
table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Merry Christmas,
Mum," Harry said softly. Molly beamed at him, ignoring the silent
war Ron and Ginny were waging with frosty glares and icy looks.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did you
sleep, Audrey, dear?" Molly asked, loading her plate with bacon and
toast.</p><p class="calibre8">"Very well thank
you, Mrs Weasley," Audrey replied, looking askance at the mountain
of food on her plate. Harry reached over and scooped half of the food
onto a plate and set it firmly in front of Ginny who had begun a
harshly whispered conversation with Ron filled with hissing and
finger pointing. Audrey shot Harry a grateful look as and shifted
uncomfortably as Ron grunted audibly and muttered something about
improper public displays.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh that's
rich," Ginny hissed suddenly. "You-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't bring up
Lavender," Ron whispered harshly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I don't
need to," Ginny retorted with no small degree of triumph. "You
just did it ifor/i me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Toast, Gin?"
Harry asked pointedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You never call me
Gin," said Ginny, raising an eyebrow at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, he probably
didn't have time to get the rest of the word out with you raving
on," Ron muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">'"I wasn't
raving," Ginny snapped. "You were the one who was complaining
about Harry and me-"</p><p class="calibre8">"When?" Ron
demanded.</p><p class="calibre8">"All the time!"
Ginny shouted. "You sent me a iHowler/i and I ended
up in idetention/i!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Detention?" Ron
asked quietly. "You are having a go at me because you got detention
when iyour/i little stunt got me kidnapped?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, don't be
melodramatic," Ginny said. "It's not like you aren't fine
now."</p><p class="calibre8">"I could have
died!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ronald!" Molly
gasped.</p><p class="calibre8">"I could have!"
Ron insisted. "Anyway, it's her fault for messing with Harry's
head!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No one messed
with my head," Harry said quietly. Ginny ignored Harry as she
glared at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"What would you
know about it anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not an
idiot," Ron growled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Never said you
were," Ginny said. "But the only ihead/i you've
messed with is probably your own." Ginny folded her arms smugly
across her chest and sat back in her chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," Molly
said warningly as the tips of Ron's ears went red.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't mess
with people's heads, because I don't seduce them and then abandon
them at the first hint of gossip!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Good for you,
Ronnikins!" George called cheerfully as he sauntered into the
kitchen from the living room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where did you
come from?" Ron grumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you see,
Ron, when a man and a woman love each other-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I did not abandon
anyone!" Ginny said hotly, ignoring George and the hand Harry
placed on her arm. "It's none of your business what goes on
between me and Harry! You should keep your nose out of it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's right,"
George said, slipping into the chair next to Audrey and snatching a
rasher of bacon from Ron's plate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,
George," said Ginny smugly.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's really
Bill's job," George said as he stole the toast from Ginny's
plate. "Your job is to stick up for Harry, here. It's in the sub
clauses of the Weasley Brotherly Affection Act. Bill's the oldest
so he gets to interrogate all of Ginny's suitors. Your deal is to
ensure Harry is armed with any and all information required for
successful engagement with Weasley females including but not limited
to how to avoid Mum's wrath, successful pilfering of fresh scones
and hiding when there's work to be done. You should leave noses in
Ginny's business to Bill. He is the only one who can come out of it
without her breaking it."</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
doing here?" Ginny asked George pointedly, now scowling at both of
her brothers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Breakfast,"
George said simply. "Christmas morning breakfast."</p><p class="calibre8">"Angelina wanted
to spend the first day of her honeymoon having breakfast with her
in-laws at the crack of dawn?" Ron asked sceptically. George
shrugged and picked up Harry's fork and speared a mouthful of
scrambled eggs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry,"
George said to Audrey, who was looking at him with trepidation.
"You're not family, your breakfast is safe."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks, George,
taking my food makes me feel right at home," Harry said dryly.
George's face fell.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't –
I'm sorry … I just-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Do I need to send
you a Howler as well?" Ron scowled at George. "Taking a man's
breakfast, as if he didn't already do enough for you …"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you,
anyway?" Ginny asked Ron grumpily. "Harry Potter's personal
defender and knight in shining armour?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone's gotta
look after him," Ron mumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm, Ron, I think
you missed the part where I can take care of myself," Harry said,
rather annoyed. He glared at Ron as he gulped at his pumpkin juice.</p><p class="calibre8">"No offence mate,
but you get into an awful lot of trouble-"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sprayed the
juice across the table, making Audrey jump as a large splotch of
juice landed on her arm. She frowned at Harry, scrubbing
ineffectively at her sleeve with a serviette.</p><p class="calibre8">"I have not been
in any trouble all year!" Harry cried plaintively.</p><p class="calibre8">"How many times
have you been in the hospital wing then?" Molly asked tartly. Harry
sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"But none of that
was my fault," he whined. Molly sniffed and handed George a plate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," Ron
said quietly. "It's just … I … Harry's been my best mate
for nearly eight years and …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not going
to hurt him, Ron," Ginny said. The kitchen had grown quiet and
Harry shifted uncomfortably. "You don't have to watch his back
any more."</p><p class="calibre8">"Isn't it cute,
Harry," George said with a smirk, "they're fighting over you."
Harry eyed George stonily but it seemed nothing could dampen George's
good mood and he hummed merrily as he poured himself a drink,
oblivious to the tension lingering over the table.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry opened his
mouth to say something, although he didn't know what, but at that
moment Arthur walked in with Angelina.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look what I found
under the Christmas tree," Arthur said brightly, pulling out a
chair for her. "I got me a new daughter for Christmas!" Arthur
dropped a kiss to the top of her head as he patted her on the
shoulder before he moved to Ginny, doing the same. Angelina smiled
shyly and Ginny grinned at her.</p><p class="calibre8">The rest of the
kitchen was soon filled as Bill and Fleur came down stairs followed
closely by Charlie. Percy arrived at the Burrow a few minutes later
and Harry watched with amusement as George and Ron subtly shifted
seats so that he had to sit next to Audrey. The girl beamed at Percy
who shuffled his feet nervously for a moment before he leaned down
and pressed a swift kiss to her cheek. Percy sat amidst a cacophony
of catcalls and whistles but he smiled sheepishly as his ears turned
pink.</p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't long
before the last plate was cleared and Ron was shifting in his seat
restlessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why do we have to
have them all under the tree this year?" he complained. "What's
wrong with opening them first thing? Isn't everyone ready yet?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I told you, young
man," Molly said, "it's because we have to wait for people to
arrive and this is the way we do it now."</p><p class="calibre8">"We only had to
wait for Percy," Ron grumbled. Catching his mother's eye, he
didn't say anything else.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I believe
we have something waiting for us under the tree and someiones/i
waiting for us in London," Arthur said briskly. "Switch on the
wireless, my dear, let's have some music with our presents!"</p><p class="calibre8">Celestina Warbeck
wafted from the wireless in the corner as the Weasleys settled down
in the living room to pass out the presents under the tree. Harry sat
placidly watching as a sea of brightly wrapped packages sailed around
him and Ron tore into the paper, scattering it across the room
haphazardly. Words of gratitude rang out and Fleur squealed excitedly
over something pink and fluffy. A heavy package wrapped in red paper
covered in fluttering golden Snitches whacked Harry in the chest and
landed with a thump in his lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi! Wake up,
Potter!" Ron called cheerily, a bright orange scarf trailing from
one hand and a package of Bertie Botts in the other. "Can't sit
there all day!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry grinned at Ron
and tore open the paper on the gift. He smiled as he revealed a solid
wooden frame that held both the Muggle Polaroid and the wizarding
photograph of his parents' engagement. Harry searched the room for
Ginny who was standing in front of Angelina. As if she could feel his
eyes on her, Ginny turned suddenly in his direction and raised and
eyebrow. Harry smiled and mouthed 'Thank you'.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny's eyes shone
and she blushed slightly before shrugging one shoulder casually.
Harry looked back down at the carefully crafted frame and knew she'd
made it herself. The carved, wooden ivy wound itself around the edge
drunkenly and the tiny broomsticks that crossed in the middle were
slightly crooked. He traced the carvings with a fingertip and watched
as his father slid an arm around his mother's waist in the
wizarding photo with his grandparents in it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
grandparents," Arthur said softly, "and your mum and dad."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's their
engagement photographs." Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"A Muggle one,"
Arthur noted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think they must
have been at my grandparents' for Christmas," Harry said, eying
the sparkling jewel on his mother's finger. "I mean my other
grandparents, the Muggle ones."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, yes that
would explain the non-moving picture," Arthur nodded gravely.</p><p class="calibre8">"My cousin found
that one at Godric's Hollow," Harry said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I heard Dedalus
agreed to take your aunt and cousin there," Arthur replied,
watching Harry trace the carvings on the edge of the frame.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny found this
one in our vault," Harry said, indicating the moving wizarding
photograph.</p><p class="calibre8">"They must have
left the Muggle things in the house," Arthur mused, staring into
the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"They …?"
Harry gazed at Arthur, confused, not understanding what the other man
meant.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Ministry,"
Arthur said absently. "The Minister then was … Molly, was Walpole
the Minister in eighty-one?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, no it was
Marchant, wasn't it?" Molly said, frowning, a new silver hat
perched jauntily on her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not eighteen
eighty-one," Arthur said, waving a hand dismissively,
"inineteen/i eighty-one."</p><p class="calibre8">"Watford," Molly
said decisively, "definitely Watford."</p><p class="calibre8">"I could have
sworn it was Walpole," Arthur mused.</p><p class="calibre8">"But what did he
ido/i?" Harry asked, leaning forward, feeling a bit
desperate to steer the conversation back to the subject of the house
at Godric's Hollow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well …"
Arthur scratched the back of his neck, suddenly looking very
uncertain. "After … afterwards they sent someone to … clean up
and pack away the, ah … things in the house."</p><p class="calibre8">"My parents'
things?" Harry asked. Molly nodded. Harry fell silent, thinking.
They must have put everything into the vault and it had been there
ever since.</p><p class="calibre8">"There was a
terrible scandal after Sirius was caught," Arthur continued
quietly. "Dumbledore made it very public that you were safe in an
undisclosed location but there was quite a carry-on about people
being able to go to the house so the Ministry put up wards and
cleaned it out before it could be looted."</p><p class="calibre8">"But the Muggle
photos were still there," Ginny interrupted. The living room had
fallen silent and Harry knew all eyes were on him and he gazed
unseeing at the edge of the frame in his hands. "Dudley found them
at … the house."</p><p class="calibre8">"I expect they
weren't important enough," Molly said gently. "They would have
only moved the wizard things."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't know
any of it still existed," Harry said quietly. "Not the house or
the photos – any of it." He suddenly felt confined. He didn't
know if he wanted to scream or cry or laugh with relief but he knew
he didn't want to do it in front of everyone. Holding onto the last
shred of his composure, Harry scrambled to his feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't mean-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's fine,
Ginny," Harry said quickly, cutting her off. "I'm just – I
need to … I'll see you all at Sirius House." Harry backed out
of the living room hurriedly, still clutching the frame. He was aware
that the Weasleys were staring at him and Ginny looked horrified, but
he needed to get out.</p><p class="calibre8">As he stumbled
through the kitchen he began to regret his hasty departure and he
sank into one of the chairs at the table, Ginny's gift landed with
a thunk on the table as he put his head into his hands. It was an odd
time to have a reaction to … things, Harry thought dimly as he
heard the kitchen door creak open.</p><p class="calibre8">"You all right,
mate?" Ron asked softly. Harry looked up. Ron was shuffling his
feet near the door, looking uncertain.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just … I
don't know," Harry answered. "It's bloody Christmas and I'm
behaving like … like – Ginny must think I'm a complete arse."
Harry sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think you just
took us all by surprise," Ron said. "You don't normally have a
reaction to … well … that …"</p><p class="calibre8">"You just haven't
seen it," Harry said quietly, staring out of the window. Ron moved
across the kitchen quietly and sat down next to Harry. Maybe Ron and
Ginny had come to a sort of truce because it surprised Harry that it
had been Ron that came after him and not Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"I saw it all –
that night," Harry said, taking a deep breath. "He showed me
everything, in my head. There was a pram, my pram … never really
thought about it before. They must have gone out together and chosen
it, before I was born. I think it just hit me, you know. They had
ithings/i and I never really knew what sort of
things, what they liked and their favourite colours; that sort of
stuff."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum's favourite
colour is blue," Ron said absently. "I guess I sort of take that
for granted."</p><p class="calibre8">"You should be
able to," Harry said heavily, pushing back his chair. "I need …
I'm just going for a walk. I'll come back in a better mood, I
promise." Harry turned, reaching for the back door knob. He felt a
hand on his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"We don't care
what your mood is," Ron said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Harry
smiled at Ron sadly. "But …"</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll meet you
at Sirius House," Ron said, releasing Harry's arm. There was
understanding in his eyes, understanding Harry didn't think Ginny
would even have had.</p><p class="calibre8">"I won't be
long," Harry replied, slipping out the door. Once outside Harry
began to wonder where he thought he was going and he started running,
his feet sliding through the slushy track that led down to the gate.
Suddenly he found himself Apparating, not even thinking about it.</p><p class="calibre8">For one wild moment
Harry spun, disoriented on the spot, shivering, wishing he'd
thought to bring his cloak, the snow flurries around him whirled and
fluttered as he stood, staring at the dilapidated sign in front of
the place in Godric's Hollow where his parents had been murdered.
Harry put a hand out, touching the sign, revealing the graffiti on it
and he noticed there was a new layer of brightly coloured writing.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt the band
constricting his heart loosen as he read and warmth flooded through
him. He looked up at the house and his mind's eye banished the run
down, dilapidated appearance, bathing the little cottage in spring
sunshine and he knew they'd been happy. It was something he didn't
have evidence for he just knew. Harry smiled slightly and released
the sign before turning to walk back along the street and to the tiny
town square. He hunched his shoulders around his ears and cast a
warming charm that made the cold bearable.</p><p class="calibre8">The early morning
light was dim and Harry could barely make out the large obelisk that
hid the statue commemorating his first defeat of Voldemort. He didn't
linger there but carried on, his feet taking him to the graveyard
where he wandered slowly towards the place where his parents lay,
surrounded by their dearest friends. Snow capped the tops of the
headstones and Harry paused, wishing he'd brought flowers. Now that
he was here, he didn't know why he'd come, he stared at the
memorial headstone for Sirius and sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy Christmas,"
he said softly. "I've been thinking … well not that long
really, I sort of came here by accident." Harry grimaced and began
pacing. "I must have meant to, I just didn't know I meant to. Now
I'm babbling, the five of you must think I'm a complete idiot. I
promise Teddy'll learn not to babble." Harry stared at Tonks's
name, thinking of his godson. Teddy was crawling all over the place
now and pulling up onto chairs and other furniture, trying to stand.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's doing
really good," Harry said, feeling the need to say something that
wouldn't sound utterly stupid. "Well, I mean … he's doing
really well. Got teeth, likes to bite, can't do anything about that
though, sorry Remus." Harry grinned, remembering the last time
Teddy had latched onto his finger and nearly drawn blood. "Fine set
of choppers … he's a fine kid, really and … I'm lucky to have
him in my life, I reckon, like Ginny ... she's the best. We … I'm
going to marry her one day. I think she already knows that. She's
brilliant and beautiful and sexy." Harry turned to his parents'
headstones. He sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wish you could
meet her," he said softly. "I wish she could meet you. She might
not want to any more, though. She gave me a brilliant Christmas
present; made it herself and everything. And I ended up flipping out
and leaving when it made me think of … you. She probably thinks I'm
a complete idiot."</p><p class="calibre8">"No she doesn't,"
Ginny's soft voice broke into his thoughts and Harry swung around
to see her standing in the snow, wearing the emerald green cloak he'd
put under the Christmas tree for her. His own cloak filled her arms
and she held it out to him mutely. Harry put it on and just stared at
her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said eventually. "I just – I felt sort of … it was …"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a lovely
cloak," Ginny blurted, "really warm and I love the colour." She
blushed spectacularly and swore under her breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum, Dad – this
is Ginny." Harry felt a slow smile spread over his face and Ginny
giggled. Harry reached for her hand and tugged her close, sliding his
arms around her waist and resting his forehead against hers. Ginny
reached up to press a kiss to his lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"Done being
maudlin?" she asked him lightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
breathed. "I'm sorry, I don't know what happened; I just felt
so …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Emotional?"
Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"I guess," Harry
sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happens to the
best of us," Ginny quipped.</p><p class="calibre8">"How'd you know
I was here?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron … he …"
Ginny bit her bottom lip. "He knew. I think he knows you best."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not a
competition," Harry said softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know!" Ginny
cried twisting out of his grip. She took a deep breath and ran a hand
through her hair, knocking the hood of her cloak askew. "We had ...
words this morning – before you got up."</p><p class="calibre8">"What about?"
Harry prompted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought he was
jealous because we've slept together," Ginny said bluntly. "But
he was worried because you haven't talked to him about it and he's
worked himself up into all sorts of bother over it. He doesn't know
how you feel and he's worried I might hurt you and he feels like …
like he can't protect you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't talk to
your brother about that!" Harry gaped at her. "He'd kill me if
I tried!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I don't
think he wants idetails/i," Ginny said dryly. Harry
didn't say anything. Ginny sighed. "The children will be
wondering where we are."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
said softly. He gazed at Ginny. "He's my best mate."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ginny
said softly, reaching up to brush the hair away from his face. "He
took your presents to Sirius House for you." Harry smiled as he
pulled her close and kissed her before Apparating them both to the
steps at Grimmauld Place.</p>
