			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Where
Clouds are Far Behind Me</strong></p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
she's so adorable! I always thought you'd get a cat! Just look at
those sweet eyes." Harry had never before heard Hermione sound so
incredibly soppy. He made a face at Ron over the girls' heads as
they pored over the photo of Dora while waiting for Bill, Fleur and
George to join them as they got ready to leave the next morning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum's
going to go nuts when you bring that thing home," warned Ron
ominously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum
will know before we get home. Kingsley has to sign the paperwork, so
we sent it to Percy," explained Ginny loftily. "So she has plenty
of time to get used to it."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can't go around bringing home strays all the time!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Aw
go on little brother, mum loves strays," said Bill's voice as he
sauntered up behind them with Fleur. "She let Percy keep his stupid
rat."</p><p class="calibre8">"More's
the pity," muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dora
is <em class="calibre9">not</em> a
stray, Ronald!" said Ginny glaring at him. "Anyway, you and the
twins brought home a whole new <em class="calibre9">person</em>!
She let you keep <em class="calibre9">him</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!
I am not a stray!" Harry's protest went unheeded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
please, tell me you wouldn't have picked him up at the train
station yourself, given half the chance?" said Ron, rolling his
eyes dramatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
am right here!" said Harry forcefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Besides,
we brought home a useful one," said Ron facetiously and he leaned
over and ruffled Harry's hair. "Our stray degomes the garden and
saves the world. What is yours going to do? Dig up the herb garden I
expect!" Harry growled at Ron as he tried to flatten his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
at least she's not an over excitable fluff ball like Pig!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
is a bit over excitable Ginny," started Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's
side are you on?" she turned on him unexpectedly. Harry made a show
of leaning over to kiss her and nuzzle her neck to prove just exactly
who's side he was on.</p><p class="calibre8">"Exactly
what are you planning on bringing home, Ginny?" intercepted Bill.
Ginny handed him the photograph.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
bought Dora yesterday."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
look at 'er adorable eyes!" squealed Fleur.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
just a dog," said Bill with amusement.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
zis ees an adorable babee!" insisted Fleur.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now
bringing home <em class="calibre9">that</em>
would give mum kittens!" said Ron, pointing a finger at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ha!
I think she'd get over it pretty quick if I did bring home a baby,
thanks to your excellent judgment in strays," said Ginny, grinning.
Ron looked at her in horror; Harry just shook his head resignedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you really buy her a dog, Harry?" asked Bill as he handed Ginny
back her photograph. Harry looked at Bill curiously and shook his
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
<em class="calibre9">Ginny</em>
bought a dog," he paused, "Creeler actually. Hey, Ginny, do you
think we could teach her to round up the garden gnomes?" Ginny
considered that for a moment before declaring that she was going to
try that very thing as soon as they got home. Bill looked at Harry
shrewdly but Harry didn't notice, concerned more at that moment
with George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where
is George?" Harry asked, twisting to look up the stairs. "He <em class="calibre9">is</em>
coming right? He didn't find some girl last night that he prefers
over us?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know how any girl could prefer anyone over you," said a low
voice from the corner. It was soft and husky and, quite frankly,
scary. Harry started and spun around. Ashley's brunette friend was
standing about three feet away, a predatory gleam in her eye. She
stepped forward and if you had asked Harry at that moment he would
have told you he was being hunted like prey. The brunette was at
least a head taller than him and she was wearing heels. Harry felt
miniscule at that moment and began looking wildly around for escape.
Evil wand-bearing wizards he could deal with. But this â€“ this was
something else!</p><p class="calibre8">As
the girl advanced on him Harry realised that Hermione, Ron and Ginny
had all abandoned him. The three of them were huddled together,
leaning on each other for support as they laughed at the horror
struck look on his face. Harry scowled at them; they were going to
pay for that.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
absolutely positive that the newspapers simply haven't got a clue
this time," said the brunette with the husky voice, unfurling a
paper and dangling it in front of Harry. If she thought that this
would have the same effect as dangling a carrot before a rabbit she
was sorely mistaken, Harry merely took another step backwards, and
slightly to the side, as he tried to put himself in range of Ron so
he could cuff him over the head. It was Bill who came to his rescue.
Smoothly inserting himself between Harry and the witch he smiled his
most charming smile at her. Swiftly plucking the newspaper from her
grasp he offered her his other hand to shake.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill
Weasley, pleasure to meet you," he said smoothly, "and you are?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Jessica,"
said the girl, "pleased to meet you." In Harry's opinion she
did not sound pleased at all. With Bill's interference Harry
managed to sidle away and place himself behind the three people he
now referred to as traitors. Hermione leaned over and snagged the
newspaper from Bill as he waved it behind his back at them. While
Hermione straightened the paper out and began scanning the front page
Bill took Jessica by the arm and led her over to the brasserie where
they had eaten breakfast two mornings ago. He deftly deposited her in
there, extolling the virtues of the scrambled eggs and handing her
over to the care of the waiter in the doorway. Bill came back, a
glaring Jessica staring holes through the back of his head as she was
ruthlessly led away by the waiter. Harry sighed with relief.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
Bill," he said gratefully before turning to the traitors. "Gee,
could you lot be any more helpful?" Ginny was still doubled over
with laughter and Hermione was engrossed in the paper so it was only
Ron who shrugged, smirking at him. Harry reached out and punched Ron
on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
goodness," squeaked Hermione suddenly. Harry didn't really want
to know but a strange force compelled him to look. Harry and Ginny
had seen a few suspicious looking characters the previous day, people
who were being trailed by Quick Quotes Quills weren't exactly
inconspicuous, but none had tried to interfere in their day. Harry
wondered what story anyone could possibly make out of him and Ginny
wandering around Origin Alley all day.</p><p class="calibre8">Apparently
if they got in touch with Rita Skeeter and then took a picture of him
and Ginny clinched together in the middle of Origin Alley, they could
make up all sorts of things.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
that's what you two like to get up to, I'm glad I wasn't around
yesterday," muttered Ron. Harry slugged him in the shoulder again.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is outrageous!" said Hermione. "Who writes this sort of
claptrap?" Harry skimmed the article written under the full colour
picture of himself and Ginny kissing in the middle of Origin Alley
the day before.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">MISS GRANGER HEARTBROKEN! HARRY POTTER TAKES
ADVANTAGE OF BENEFACTOR'S DAUGHTER?</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">If
our sources are to be believed, and they are, the floozy in the above
picture is none other than a Miss Weasley, youngest child and only
daughter of the family who took Mr Potter in when he found himself
homeless following the war in Britain which he singlehandedly put a
stop to mere months ago. It is possible that this young woman has
been offered to Mr Potter as a reward of sorts. However, according to
our sources in Britain (because we have been quite unable to actually
capture her face), Weasley is considered to be quite good looking and
Mr Potter would not be the first war hero to enjoy the spoils of war.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">There
is debate in British wizarding circles about whether Weasley has been
offered to Mr Potter by her destitute parents, who surely stand to
make good money with a suitable match, or if she has simply been
seduced by the heroic visage of wizarding Britain's most eligible
bachelor and endeavoured to trap him. It has been acknowledged that
Harry Potter could have any witch of his choosing and there are those
who do not believe that he would choose Weasley willingly. </em></p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">I'm
telling you she [Weasely] is an expert at Love Potions," says
Weasely's Hogwarts classmate Miss Romilda Vane. "Her best friend
is Hermione Granger, the brightest witch at school. She could have
taught her easily enough." Has Miss Granger lost her true love by
her own hand? Has Mr Potter been bewitched? However if she is as good
looking as they say perhaps Mr Potter simply prefers her to the
rather plain Miss Granger. One wonders what sparks might fly when
Miss Granger learns of her friend's betrayal, if indeed it is a
betrayal on her part.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Perhaps the betrayal is Mr Potter's. If Harry
Potter could have any woman he chooses, could he in fact be taking
advantage of his status to bed whoever takes his fancy? Another
possibility is that Mr Potter simply feels a debt to the Weasely
family. Our source spoke to Mr Potter's classmate Mr Neville
Longbottom.</em></p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Well,
Ginny [Weasley] did have a crush on Harry," he says. "They're
like his family, the Weasleys, they look after him. He'd do
anything for them." Have her parents successfully negotiated a
desirable match for their daughter or is our young hero simply doing
his foster family a service and giving their daughter what she has
sought all these years in repayment for their kindness?</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Only
time will tell but for now the question remains, has Harry Potter
abandoned his child and its mother in favour of a clearly
unsustainable relationship based on lies and love potions?</em></p><p class="calibre8">"This
is just â€¦ Harry! You have <em class="calibre9">got</em>
to do something about this!" said Hermione forcefully as she waved
the paper in his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
exactly do you propose I do, Hermione?" said Harry exasperatedly.
"The only successful interaction I ever had with the press was
arranged by <em class="calibre9">you</em>,
so why don't you do something!" Harry and Hermione began to
bicker, loudly, collecting their fair share of stares as people moved
through the foyer of the hotel. Neither heard Ginny mutter that she
was going to fetch George, nor did they notice when she moved softly
up the stairs. Harry began to tune out as Hermione got into her
stride. She began pacing and waving her arms about, stopping
intermittently to waggle a finger in his face. Running out of steam,
Harry tried desperately to keep a straight face as Hermione began to
list the creative ways in which she would make Romilda Vane sorry
she'd ever learned to talk. As Hermione began to wind down he
forced himself to stop looking at Ron, who was pulling faces at him
behind Hermione's back, and pay attention to her.</p><p class="calibre8">"-
you have got to deal with it, Harry!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
Hermione."</p><p class="calibre8">"This
can't go on."</p><p class="calibre8">"No
Hermione."</p><p class="calibre8">"The
record really needs to be set straight!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
Hermione."</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
what are you going to do about it?" Hermione turned on him
suddenly, forcefully. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know," he confessed. "Can you think of something? Please?
I'll be your best friend?" He gave her his best puppy dog look
and she laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
already your best friend," she said with a smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
it!" exclaimed Ron suddenly. Hermione whirled to look at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh!"
she exclaimed. She began nodding. "It might just work, yes. It's
perfect!" Ron was smiling and nodding along with her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
see, it's obvious."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
yes, it just might work! You're brilliant Ron!" said Hermione,
beaming at both him and Harry. Ron looked smug but Harry just looked
at them in utter confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
er, you both think it's a great idea then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course Harry!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Bound
to work!"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
positively scary that you two can do that," Harry said, shaking his
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
don't you think it's a brilliant plan, Harry?" persisted
Hermione. Harry had absolutely no idea, because unlike them, he had
no idea what the plan was. He just nodded. If there were any people
in the world he could trust they were Ron and Hermione. If they had a
plan he'd go along with it. He contemplated that it was somewhat a
turn of events; they often went along with what he said. It was sort
of comforting to go along with someone else's idea for a change. He
smiled and turned to Ginny. She wasn't there.</p><p class="calibre8">Scanning
the foyer in confusion he was unable to locate her and his heart
sank. Was she upset that he'd turned to Ron and Hermione? Was she
embarrassed about the article, or angry perhaps? Well, he reasoned
with himself, she <em class="calibre9">had </em>been
laughing at his predicament with the predatory Jessica, so maybe it
served her right. He dismissed that idea as soon as it came. She
definitely didn't deserve any of this. Harry had gotten relatively
used to the press by now and Hermione seemed to take it in her
stride. Ron was lucky enough to rarely be mentioned but Ginny had
never before been the subject of such speculation, rumour and
innuendo. Harry sighed heavily, running his hand through his hair,
unable to locate her. Bill and Fleur were reading the article and
Fleur was tutting in one of the best imitations of her mother in law
that Harry had ever seen.</p><p class="calibre8">"'Oo
do zey zink zey are, zees reporters?" she questioned the air
angrily. "Zey cannot call 'er a floozy! Zis ees not right!
'Arry!" Harry jumped. Fleur was glaring at him menacingly and
waved the paper in his face much like Hermione had done.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
weel fix zis!" she snarled at him. Harry just looked at her in
alarm. Bill put a calming hand on her arm and spoke softly in her ear
and her face softened. Suddenly she threw herself at him. "Oh of
course eet ees not your fault!" Harry's head was fairly spinning
now and his anxiety over Ginny was increasing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
Ginny?" he asked. Hermione looked up from the Galleon in her hand
and Ron shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't keep track of her, Harry, that's your job," he said.
Harry just glowered at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
talk about her like that," he growled. "She's not a <em class="calibre9">pet</em>
or something to be tracked and catalogued!" Ron backed up several
steps, raising his hands in surrender. Harry realised he had his wand
in his hand and had begun to raise it. He dropped his hand and
sighed. Surrendering to his frustration he kicked a nearby rubbish
bin.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
okay mate?" asked Ron softly. Harry put his wand away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
sorry Ron," he said softly. "It's not fair. That article is
terrible and Ginny doesn't deserve this. It's says simply awful
things about her and all of you. And what was Neville thinking?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't expect he was quoted accurately Harry," said Hermione as
she briskly tapped her DA Galleon and pocketed it. "Now Neville and
Luna should get that message soon enough. I do hope Dennis has his on
him. Dean will be easy enough for Luna to contact if he hasn't got
his on him, do you suppose Neville will be able to track down Seamus
easily enough?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you on about Hermione?" asked Harry exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He'll
tell Parvati anyway, won't he?" interrupted Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
and hopefully they can get it issued today," added Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell
me what on earth is going on!" roared Harry. Ron looked at him in
alarm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Calm
down Harry, it's the plan!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
if I knew what the plan <em class="calibre9">was</em>
maybe I would be calm!" cried Harry in sheer frustration. "You
two are talking in secret lovers' code and Ginny has vanished! You
expect me to keep<em class="calibre9"> calm</em>?"
Hermione blushed violently and the tips of Ron's ears went red.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
just used the DA Galleon to contact Luna and Neville," explained
Hermione as the blush began to fade. "Luna is going to publish an
article about you and your friends. An accurate one, illustrated with
photos that Colin has taken. They will talk to your friends and
present an accurate picture of things."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
and mum and dad," added Ron. "If they've caught even a whiff of
this, they'll be furious." Harry let out a deep breath that he
didn't realise he'd been holding.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
he said softly. Hermione smiled at him and Ron slugged him on the
shoulder. Harry feigned grievous injury, staggering slightly and
grinning. He sobered suddenly. "Where did Ginny go?" He was
answered by a groan from behind. George was holding one hand to his
head, shuffling across the foyer. Ginny was trailing him, dragging
his bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't wait until I am of age," she huffed as she threw the bag at
George's feet. "Next time you get roaring drunk and have a
hangover you can carry, or levitate, since <em class="calibre9">you</em>
are of age, your own blasted bag!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,
stop shouting," whined George. "You promised you'd stop doing
that." Ginny crossed her arms and glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Serves
you right!" she growled. George raised an eyebrow and looked from
Bill to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
up her nose?" George asked them and Ginny shrieked wordlessly at
him, a sound that pierced Harry's skull even though he wasn't
hungover. No wonder George began whimpering.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,
call her off," he said, most unwisely, and he found himself on the
wrong end of a bat bogey hex.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
treat me like an object or a â€“a pet!" she spat, advancing on him.
Bill swiftly put himself between Ginny and George and demanded that
she remove the hex on George. Unwilling, or perhaps unable to defy
Bill, Ginny complied.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know you're angry Gin, I am too, but turning on George is not the
answer," said Bill softly. "Please, put your wand away." Ginny
stood rigid, her wand still dangling at her side, eyes hard and
glittering.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,"
murmured Harry. Whatever else he had been going to say to her didn't
matter. She turned to him then, the rigid stance gone, the fury
dissipating. Harry reached out and pulled her to him and she resisted
him for only a split second before allowing Harry to enfold her in
his arms. She sighed heavily and Harry kissed the top of her head
tenderly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry, George," she said. George glowered at her but nodded his
head briefly and then winced at the movement.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
were you doing last night?" questioned Bill peering at George,
inspecting the dark circles under his bloodshot eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Drinking
with Jonathon," muttered George. Bill shook his head resignedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
make a habit of it, hey?" he said softly, putting a hand on
George's shoulder. His younger brother looked up at him
tremulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
only makes the pain go away for a while," he said quietly. "It's
just as bad in the morning."</p><p class="calibre8">"Only
now you have a hangover to boot," grinned Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Piss
off," said George listlessly. At that moment Jonathon came bounding
exuberantly through the front door of the hotel.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
morning everybody!" George winced dramatically and Jonathon laughed
before thrusting a small bottle at him. "Drink up Georgie boy!
You'll feel good enough to hit the frog and toad after a shot of
that!" George eyed him warily before drinking the contents of the
bottle.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
hope that's not a reference some new sort of cuisine you intend to
introduce me to." George grimaced at the after taste of the potion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah
mate, rhyming slang â€“ frog and toad â€“ road. I'm coming with
youse!" said Jonathon cheerily. "On the Roobus, Bert was getting
up me last night."</p><p class="calibre8">"Bert?"
squinted George, looking marginally better and now only holding his
head with one hand. "I don't remember Bert?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think you were too plastered mate," said Jonathon cheerfully. "Had
a few sheilas interested in you but." George looked at him
blearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
did?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yep!"
said Jonathon, clearly far too cheerily for George's hangover.
"Bert brought some very nice looking sheilas along and they were
<em class="calibre9">very</em>
interested in you mate!" George looked at him askance.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
â€“ um â€¦ where â€“ oh bollocks!" said George. Ron stifled a
snigger and Hermione looked at him disapprovingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
worry, nothing too drastic," laughed Jonathon. "I packed you off
back here before you got in more than a good pash with Amy. Lovely
girl, that â€¦" He trailed off clearly lost in a very nice memory
involving the lovely Amy.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
seem to remember you were wrapped around a girl actually," said
George looking thoughtfully at him. "It's a pretty vague memory
though. I wish I could remember more about what I got up to."
Jonathon looked strained.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
that weren't nothing, she's not, well, she don't think of me
like that," he said a little wistfully. "Both had a few too many
pots and got a bit carried away. I remember enough that you didn't
embarrass yourself mate, don't worry."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
I'm not worried," said George cheekily, his hangover clearly
gone. "It's just a travesty I can't remember what was clearly
such a lovely snog. So why are you coming along today?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Apparently
I don't spend enough time with Bert and Ernie, my bestest friends
in the whole wide world," here Jonathon began waving his arms
erratically as if emphasising the entire world, "and if I don't
spend some <em class="calibre9">quality time</em>
with Bert today I'm getting my backside booted from here to Sunday.
Accordin' to Bert hanging out with Ernie just ain't the same, so
I'm on the Roobus today. Probably need my help with the whole chess
club anyway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Be
a great way to see the country though. Ernie says youse're the last
booking so you'll have to tag along while he does everyone else.
It'll be grouse but! Say, have you lot seen the <em class="calibre9">Oracle</em>
today? Should be shot, them journos I reckon. Anyone who's seen
youse two together would be mad to believe a word of it." He nodded
at Ginny who was still wrapped firmly in Harry's arms. Truthfully
Harry was afraid to let her go because he was drawing a lot of
comfort from simply holding her. He smiled at Jonathon and pulled her
subtly closer, running one hand down her back to rest lightly on one
hip and perhaps she sensed his feelings because she looked up at him
and reached up a hand to stroke his cheek gently, mouthing 'I love
you' at him. Unable to resist her, Harry leaned down and kissed her
softly before pulling back a little.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now
that picture would tell the real story," said Ron softly. Harry
ignored him, lost as he was in the depths of Ginny's eyes. It was
like he could speak to her this way, it made the touch of her hand on
his cheek more real and the rest of the world fade away. In her eyes
he could see how much she loved him, how much she had always loved
him and he could see, on the edges, the anger and embarrassment the
article had caused her. He wanted desperately to take away that pain
and wondered if he willed it long enough or loved her hard enough if
that would do it.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
love you," he whispered to Ginny just before a glaring flash went
off. Startled, they both turned to see Hermione looking at them
apologetically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,"
she murmured, "but that's the perfect picture and they do say a
picture is worth a thousand words." Harry smiled at Hermione before
looking back down at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"They've
got a plan," he said. "I'm sorry that was printed that about
you. I wish I knew how to make it go away, but Hermione's contacted
Luna. They've got some crazy plan involving her and Neville and
Dean." Harry shrugged while Ginny looked sceptically at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
you trust these two?" she asked. Harry nodded while Ginny eyed Ron
who was absently scratching his head while Hermione lectured him
about correctly packing her camera back in the case.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
trust these two with my life, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"Her,
I get, it's the fact that you trust him that makes me question your
sanity." Harry laughed, watching Ginny's eyes sparkle with
mischief, the pain in them nearly gone. Harry made it his mission to
eliminate all traces by the end of the day.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on! Bert and Ernie'll be here any minute and I do NOT need to be on
Bert's bad side right now thanks very much," said Jonathon
impatiently. The rest grabbed their bags and followed him out onto
the footpath.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
we have to summon it?' asked Harry curiously as Jonathon just stood
there.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah,
Roobus turns up on timetable if you booked it," he said. "Might
get summoned a few times today I suppose. Most people know to book it
if you want it to arrive within coo-ee of the time of the time you
need it." Sure enough, within moments an enormous electric blue bus
arrived with a BANG and jerked to a stop in front of them. A slight
girl with dark hair and piercing blue eyes leapt down from the back
end of the bus that Harry now saw looked almost identical to the
Knight Bus, apart from its colour. The girl raced up to Jonathon and
threw her arms around his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought you were joshing about being here today!" she shrieked in
his ear. "You're coming?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I am," said Jonathon hugging her back. "Did'ya honestly think I
was pullin' ya leg? Stone the flamin' crows you're a daft one,
Bert!" At that moment the front door to the bus blew open and a
dark curly head poked out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
molestin' him <em class="calibre9">Alberta</em>,"
said the young man with the badge that proclaimed him as Ernie. "It's
not like you haven't seen him in yonks! You went 'round last
night!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me that!" hissed Bert. "You know I hate that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
an' I know how you think any minute away from Johno is torture,"
muttered Ernie, not loud enough for Jonathon, helping Bill and George
load luggage, to hear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call him Johno," sighed Bert. "You know he hates it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mebee
if you would just take him to bed you'd loosen him up some aye?"
said Ernie with a grin showing a set of even, white teeth. Bert
blushed heavily and shoved Ernie back into the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut
up!" said Bert, clambering up after him. "He doesn't even know
I'm alive. Would he have gone out with the incredible face sucking
Amy if he knew?" Harry raised an eyebrow at Ginny and she stifled a
giggle as they followed Bert's beckoning hand onto the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mebee
you shoulda thought about that afore you went and tried to make him
jealous with Griffin," said Ernie settling into the driver's
seat, which was a deck chair, "pompous ass."</p><p class="calibre8">"Remind
you of anyone?" Ginny muttered. Harry completely lost it then and
Ron had to shove him unceremoniously up the steps of the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
so funny?" he asked plaintively as Harry collapsed in a laughing
heap in the aisle. "Move over Harry, I want to get a seat!" The
inside of the Roobus was furnished with an assortment of deck chairs,
squashy arm chairs and recliners, a circular staircase stood in one
back corner. There was a muted murmur of voices coming from the
floors above them but the ground floor was empty of passengers.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
eventually pushed Harry's head down and stepped over him, claiming
a recliner in the middle of the bus. George, Bill and Jonathon
clambered into the bus through the back and flopped into deck chairs
near the back. Hermione and Fleur went to find seats while Ginny
fixed up their fare with Bert after liberating Harry's pocket of
his money bag. Returning to Harry she hauled him upright now that he
had almost ceased his laughter and pushed him into a recliner a few
seats away from Ron. Harry watched Hermione settle herself in Ron's
lap and sobered as he saw Ron smile up at her and reach out to smooth
her hair, whispering something that made Hermione smile back. She
tucked an arm around him and snuggled her head under his chin. Ron
put a hand on her thigh and began stroking it softly while he kissed
the back of her neck. Harry didn't realise it but he was wearing
the same expression that people often saw on Ron when he watched
Harry with his sister.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you thinking?" asked Ginny softly from the chair beside him.
Harry turned to Ginny and snaked out a hand to pull her onto his lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wondering
if Hermione knows how much Ron loves her," said Harry quietly,
unable to resist burying his face in Ginny's hair and running a
hand down the length of her thigh. Ginny turned to look at them.
Hermione had turned her face up to Ron who was holding the back of
her head with one hand and was peppering her face with little kisses
while his other hand ran up her leg, over her hip and up under her
jumper.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think she has a pretty good idea," answered Ginny as Ron stopped
teasing Hermione and covered her mouth with his. Hermione's eyes
fluttered shut and her hand reached up to rest on Ron's chest as
the two kissed, heedless of the audience around them. Harry smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">***************************</p><p class="calibre8">The
Roobus sped across the continent stopping abruptly to let off members
of the chess club and picking up an assortment of witches and wizards
who seemed to know Bert and Ernie quite well. A number were obviously
familiar with Jonathon also. They headed north, picking up the
Flidge maintenance wizard at Wollemi, who complained that he'd only
just finished cleaning the Flidges after Saturday's game and he'd
have to go back on Wednesday to make sure they were all open and
working for the Friday night Thunderer â€“ Nargun game, which the
Narguns were, for the first time ever, tipped to win. Harry wondered
aloud why he wasn't Flidging home and Bert chuckled loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't
handle Flidging," she said, "makes him terribly sick!"</p><p class="calibre8">The
first of the chess club players was dropped off at a poky little town
in the middle of nowhere and Jonathon pointed out some of the local
landmarks in the distance before the Roobus suddenly shot off again.
They got a glimpse of the beach at Tweed Heads where a rather gloomy
looking wizard carrying an enormous chess set disembarked and
scurried off into the sand dunes. At Toowoomba, in Queensland, they
picked up a rather shifty looking wizard who Ernie loudly warned not
to cause any trouble or he'd throw him off in the middle of
nowhere.</p><p class="calibre8">"Quite
capable of doing that too," muttered Jonathon as the shifty wizard
skulked up the stairs at the rear. "There's miles and miles of
desert out there you'd not see anyone for days if Ernie took a mind
to it."</p><p class="calibre8">An
assortment of scantily clad witches got on and off the bus in
Rockhampton and Townsville before they left two elderly members of
the chess club at a street in a small town that looked to be
surrounded by sugar cane and banana plantations. As they headed west
Jonathon made Ernie stop the bus so they could look at the
rainforests and Hermione took their picture in front of a stunning
waterfall. By the time they arrived in Darwin and offloaded several
passengers it was time for morning tea. Harry got off the bus with
the rest to stretch his legs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Here,
I thought it was bloody winter mate!" exclaimed Ron as they stepped
into what might reasonably be considered sweltering heat. Jonathon
laughed as Ron stripped off his jumper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Youse're
in Darwin mate. They don't know the meaning of the word cold!"
Harry idly thought that the Postmistress had not been joking about
the different climates in Australia. Jonathon continued, "Now,
Melbourne, they know the meaning of the word cold. Hey Ern! Are we
going to Melbourne today?" Ernie looked thoughtful for a moment
before he nodded. Jonathon looked satisfied.</p><p class="calibre8">"There,
that'll learn youse what cold is," he said smugly. Ron shook his
head at Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mate,
you're talking to people who went to school in a drafty castle in
Scotland," he said. "You have no idea what cold is."</p><p class="calibre8">"'Ogwarts
ees 'orrible and cold," shuddered Fleur. "But zees 'umidity,
eet is not much better. My 'air, eet weel go leemp." She flounced
back into the bus and Ginny pulled a face behind her retreating back.
They spent a few moments sunning themselves before Ernie herded them
back onto the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">They
had just dropped Mrs Somersby and six large cats off in the Bungle
Bungles in the far north when a loud and wailing klaxon sounded
throughout the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
the bloody hell was that?" demanded Ron when it stopped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Summoning
alarm," said Ernie shortly and he began winding a handle just above
his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hold
on!" bellowed Bert as the bus suddenly lurched magnificently,
shuddered and came to a stop with a huge bang in front of a old
building in what was clearly a sea port. Harry was flung out of his
chair and hit the side of the bus with a thud and as soon as the bus
stopped quivering Ginny and Hermione has rushed to his aid.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,
are you okay?" asked Hermione anxiously as Harry lay still, a pain
thumping in his head. Harry opened his eyes, squinting in the bright
light and groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you all right mate?" said Bert frantically as she leaned over
Harry. "Old Mr Walpole â€¦ always summoning the bus in an
emergency. One of these days it will be an emergency I suppose. Can
you move?" Harry experimented and found, to his own surprise, that
he could actually sit upright. Ginny was looking at him, worry etched
on her features and he smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
okay," he said, "takes more than a bus ride to do me in." He
grinned at her but to his consternation Ginny burst into tears. With
a speed he did not know he had, he had her in his arms and was
whispering softly in her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,
it's all right, we're all okay. I just lost my grip." Ginny
sniffed loudly and with great effort pulled herself together. She
didn't say anything but curled herself into his lap. Harry shared a
puzzled look with Ron before gingerly getting to his feet and sitting
back in his chair. Ginny curled up in his lap once more. Once Bert
and Ernie had established that Harry was fine and apologised
profusely for the mishap the Roobus was on its way again. Mr
Walpole's 'emergency' had seen them fly across the country to
Fremantle and now they were on their way to Adelaide before they went
Outback. Harry idly listened to Jonathon tell Bill about Adelaide as
they travelled across a vast expanse of desert.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pretty
little place really, not much life in it but," Jonathon mused.
"They got heaps of wineries down there. Coupla good beaches, little
bit of shopping but, yeah, bit quiet. I'm a city boy meself and
South Australia's not much but Adelaide and a heap of desert."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
used to the desert," said Bill a trifle wistfully. "I used to
work in Eygpt."</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
a few chess clubbers who live in the desert," Bert said idly.
"We'll drop 'em off after lunch in Adelaide and youse can 'ave
a squizz at the sandy stuff."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
take too long about it," Ernie grumbled. "Mr Walpole has already
put us behind schedule." Bert pulled a face at the back of Ernie's
head and Jonathon chuckled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
shifted his attention to Ginny then. She was still curled up in his
lap, her hands grasping his shirt and her head tucked under his chin.
Harry wondered if she was asleep, she had been so still and quiet.
Harry met Ron's eyes over the top of Ginny's head. Ron was
looking sadly at his sister and offered Harry a weak smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny?"
Harry whispered. The only answer he got was her right hand tightening
imperceptibly around the chunk of his shirt that she was holding as
her body began to tremble slightly. Harry began to softly stroke her
hair and then down her back before running his hand along her arms.
Something had spooked her and Harry would give anything to know what
it was.</p><p class="calibre8">As
he stroked her tenderly he felt Ginny relax and he twisted his head
to try and see her face. Her eyes were closed and there were slight
frown lines on her forehead. Raising a hand gently Harry smoothed
them away and pulled her face up to press a kiss to her forehead. He
felt her shiver as he trailed a hand down the side of her face and
neck and prayed that it was a shiver of delight and not one of dread.
He was rewarded when Ginny opened her eyes and smiled at him. He
wanted to question her but he saw some of the pain still in her eyes
and, wanting more than anything for it to go away, he kissed her,
softly at first and then with growing urgency despite the presence of
her brothers.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
released her hold on his shirt and wound her fingers up into his hair
while Harry cradled her head in one hand and ran the other along her
thigh and over her hip. He wanted to pour all his feelings into that
kiss so that she knew how much he cared for her and loved her and so
that the pain on the edges of her eyes would go away. Ginny responded
enthusiastically to his kiss. Opening her mouth to him she pressed
him back into the chair and kissed him until his head was spinning
and he was dizzy from lack of oxygen. When she pulled away Ginny laid
her head next to his on the back of the chair and Harry looked into
her eyes, breathing heavily and willing her to know how much he loved
her. As he watched he thought he could see the dark spots that were
her pain fade until almost none was left and he smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
Ginny," Harry breathed. "Are you okay now?" Ginny nodded
without offering further explanation and they sat in silence until
the bus came to a shuddering halt in a wide tree lined street.</p><p class="calibre8">It
was certainly not warm in Adelaide, a fact which had Ron complaining
loudly as he pulled his jumper back over his head. They had come to a
stop in the heart of South Australia's capital, but true to form,
the Muggles bustling about did not notice the massive electric blue
bus sitting outside their train station. The trees were overpowered
by the multi-storied buildings behind them and their bare branches
left the street looking rather bleak, the grey of the buildings
blending with the colour of the skies above them. There was a food
van parked in front of them and Harry could hear the distant rattle
of trains as they pulled out of the station behind it. The remaining
passengers on the bus clattered down the staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
Ern, you ever gonna pick a different lunch spot?" grumbled a
hunchbacked old wizard in purple robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah,
I'm not," said Ernie.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
nothing wrong with a good pie floater now and again. Go find a
sandwich shop if you're not happy, you lazy bugger," interjected
Bert. The old wizard kept grumbling as he exited the bus. Harry
followed him off the bus, Ginny clinging tightly to his hand. He
squeezed her hand reassuringly and asked if she was okay. Ginny
nodded firmly but Harry could not shake the feeling that she had been
unreasonably upset when he had hit the side of the bus but he could
not quite place his finger on why. He felt like he should know but
the reason was elusive. He shrugged mentally, it's not like he was
hurt, the bump had been minor and if they kept dwelling on it they'd
not have any fun. He smiled at Ginny warmly and they trailed Ron to
the food van.</p><p class="calibre8">The
food van in front of them turned out to be a pie cart. It looked
closed so Harry was unsure how they were supposed to get lunch there.
One of the witches from the Roobus had seated herself on the footpath
and opened her packed sandwich but the other occupants were clustered
around the van. Ernie reached out and tapped on the shutter and it
suddenly rose up with a loud clatter. A young, spotty wizard peered
out at them.</p><p class="calibre8">"About
time Ern!" he said. "I were about to give up on ya and go home!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yer
full of it," said Ernie shortly, "now give us our lunch afore the
Muggles start noticin'!"</p><p class="calibre8">Lunch
turned out to be a selection of savoury pastries including a rather
odd looking combination of meat pie, smothered in tomato sauce,
sitting in green pea soup that Ernie dug into with relish. The sickly
green combined with pastry and bright red tomato sauce was something
that not even Ron was sure was a good idea. He wasn't one to pass
up a challenge however and when Jonathon called him a wuss for not
giving it a go Ron tried it. Harry chose a less threatening looking
pasty and Ginny a pie without the green bits. Fleur looked ill at the
thought of any of it but gamely attempted a pie, having had one at
the Quidditch. No one was sad to board the bus again however as
standing on a freezing street eating baked pastry goods from paper
bags wasn't exactly pleasant. Ernie was the only one who seemed to
have any real enthusiasm for the idea.</p><p class="calibre8">As
the bus rumbled north Harry noticed Bert watching Jonathon as he and
George conversed quietly in one corner of the bus. Harry hadn't
been friends with Ron and Hermione for seven years without picking up
a few things and he could tell that Jonathon was as taken with Bert
as she obviously was with him. Jonathon watched her when he thought
no one was looking and whenever she got up to assist a passenger off
the bus his eyes followed her curves up the staircase. No doubt he
was also taking the opportunity to catch as much of her legs as
possible, which wasn't difficult as Bert was clad in what was
obviously national dress, even for wizards, of shorts and thongs. She
had protested vehemently when Ron called them flip-flops and declared
that term 'poncy and foreign', demanding that they all refer to
them as thongs while they were down under, thank you very much.
George had not been amused to learn that what he had been used to
calling a thong was in fact almost always called a G-String (although
Ernie clearly preferred the term 'butt floss') and, in answer to
Jonathon's cheeky inquiry, none of them were likely to find out if
Bert was wearing one! As Bert helped old Mrs Weatherstone off the bus
at a very pink roadhouse in a place called Oodnadatta, George leaned
over to Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you keep looking at her like that your eyes are going to fall out of
your head and then we'll have to pick them up and pull the dust off
them," George whispered. "Make a move, man!" Jonathon glared at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Get
real! She does <em class="calibre9">not</em>
think of me like that," said Jonathon morosely. "I wish."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
stop it!" said Hermione sharply to the surprise of them all. "If
she was ogling you any more when you bent over to haul a suitcase off
the bus we'd be picking up <em class="calibre9">her</em>
eyeballs! You men just try to get out of making a move because you're
chicken!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Unsure,
Hermione, not chicken," ventured Ron. Hermione turned and gave him
a scathing look.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yes Mr Lionheart," she scoffed. "Did you ever even <em class="calibre9">make</em>
a move?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
with Lavender," muttered Harry. The tips of Ron's ears were red
and he glared at Harry menacingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can't talk," said Ron fiercely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
I can," argued Harry. "I kissed a girl before you ever did."</p><p class="calibre8">"Unless
you count Auntie Muriel," giggled Ginny and Ron threw a threatening
glance in her direction and growled. George stood up dramatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Children,
children," he proclaimed condescendingly. "Now is not the time
for petty bickering. She's coming back, shhhhhhhhh." Bert
scrambled back onto the bus and called out to Ernie that they were
right to go before sinking into the deckchair next to Jonathon and
declaring old Mrs Weatherstone the most verbose person she ever had
the misfortune to meet. She crossed her legs and leaned back,
stretching and closing her eyes, exposing the skin of her neck and
wrists to Jonathon as she did so. He was mesmerised. George began
whispering in his ear, Jonathon whispering fiercely back.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you two whispering about like a pair of Nyols?" Bert asked
lazily. Jonathon started suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing,"
he said, "never mind." George went to say something else and
Jonathon elbowed him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,"
protested George, "I just wanted to know what a Nyol was!" Harry
was rather curious himself. It turned out they were tiny little grey
creatures with big ears who lived in the rocks. They were a bit
elusive but you could tell they were around because you could hear
them whispering and rustling. They were pretty strong though so in
Jonathon's opinion you wanted to be careful when walking where
Nyols were as they grabbed at your ankles.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
reckon there is some at Coober Pedy, that's the next stop," Bert
said, eyes still closed, Jonathon still staring at her legs. "I've
never seen any evidence of that though. Hey Ernie?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
Bert?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We
going to Coober Pedy this arvo?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
Bert."</p><p class="calibre8">"Got
time to stop and stretch our legs?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
Bert."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
want desert, Bill," said Jonathon. "Coober Pedy's got desert.
Heaps of desert. Come to that Australia's got a lot of desert. Some
people think the desert's dead you know, but desert around here
don't mean dead at all. Teeming with life our deserts, isn't that
right Ernie? Ernie grew up in the deserts, born in Alice Springs.
He's a boy from the bush even if I'm not. Hey Ernie, we gunna be
in Alice before dinner at this rate?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
Johno."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me that." Harry grinned. Ernie seemed to be getting more
taciturn as they day went on. He rather thought perhaps being friends
with Jonathon had rendered Ernie thus.</p><p class="calibre8">It
was only a few more minutes before they reached Coober Pedy and
rolled into a rather dusty red-earthed town. It had few buildings but
Bert soon explained that a lot of places were actually underground,
dug into the earth in the sides of hills. Once she pointed that out
it was easier to see them. Ernie brought the bus to a stop on a
street lined with shops and they disembarked into a dry but not
unpleasantly hot climate. A nearby window display caught Harry's
eye. It was full of jewellery decked with opals, the stones Ginny had
admired in the jewellery shop window in Origin Alley the day before.
Bert noticed his gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Opals,"
she said, "millions of 'em here, opal capital of the world."
Harry chanced a glance at Ginny and saw that she and Hermione were
engaged in trying to entice Fleur off the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
do me a favour, keep Ginny occupied," he whispered to Bert. She
winked at him conspiratorially and gave him a small salute as he
hurried into the jewellery store. His mission was short and sweet and
expedited with the utmost speed. He rather thought he'd managed to
get away with it until Ginny settled in his lap as they took off
again.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
where did you go, Mr Potter?" she asked slyly. Harry shrugged his
shoulders. "Did you think I wouldn't notice? I notice everything
about you, Harry." Harry gulped as her hands began to roam. He
stopped her as her hands got daringly close to straying below his
waist and smiled his most winning smile at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
no you don't, Miss Weasley," he said softly, pinning her hands
with his own, larger ones. "I know what you are looking for, and
you won't find it. Wait until tomorrow, like a good girl." Ginny
frowned at him and he kissed it away with soft, delicate kisses that
made her melt into him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!
Get a room!" said George plaintively. "I'm sick of watching you
two go at it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
watching then," said Ginny tartly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
there isn't anything else to watch," complained George. "That
landscape's a bit monotonous."</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
nearly there," said Bert. "Got three chess clubbers to drop off
in Alice and then it's just young Arkie going to Melbourne. After
that we'll get you lot to Yackandandah. Scenery's a lot more
inviting down south."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
Ernie, you gunna swing by Yulara?" called Jonathon. "Be a treat
for the Poms hey? Can't bring 'em all the way in this rattler
without swinging by the Rock! And your mum is always having a go at
you for not visiting her. Keep the old chook happy maybe?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
out of the way," grumbled Ernie shortly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Aw
go on Ern! Arkie'd go for it, he hates getting off the bus on a
Monday night anyway. Always wants to stay and chat," interrupted
Bert. "Anyway you promised your mum she'd see more of you once
you started driving the bus, not less, and we haven't detoured to
Yulara for ages."</p><p class="calibre8">"All
right," said Ernie shortly and moments later he brought the bus to
a shuddering stop in what appeared to be the middle of a dry river
bed. It was sandy with smooth round rocks and stones scattered
throughout. Trees grew at odd angles along the edges and at one point
a massive fallen tree trunk seemed to act as a root system for a line
of trees that all stood straight up in a line, growing from the
fallen trunk. The last three chess club members disembarked here and
Bill looked curiously out at their surroundings.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
what's with the camels?" he asked Bert. Harry craned his neck to
see the train of camels ambling along towards them. About six camels
were tied together, people swaying atop of them. They all clambered
off the bus to get a better look and their feet sank into the soft
sand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thought
this was Australia?" said Ron, puzzled. "What're the camels
doing here?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
ship of the desert, best thing for transporting things in the
outback," said Bert. "I rode a camel once. They replaced the
camels with trains eventually but camels are a major tourist
attraction. By the looks these ones are heading back out along the
river to the camel farm for dinner."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
river?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
in the river mate," said Bert, rolling her eyes. "Todd River.
It's not flowing right now. Hardly ever flows. Grouse bit of
scenery but." Harry had to admit, it was picturesque and the
rolling camels with the people riding gracefully on top were
mesmerising. He was shaken out of his trance by Ernie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi,
if ya wanna go to Uluru, get back on the bus," he said grumpily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mate,
if you're gunna see ya mum," said Jonathon, "be a bit more
cheery aye?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
gunna have words with me," complained Ernie. "First she'll 'ave
a go at me for not hangin' around, then she'll have a few things
to say about me not usin' me education wisely after all her
sacrifice. Then I'll probably get the 'you don' come and see me
enough' lecture."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you don't go and see your old lady enough Ern!" said Bert in
frustration. Ernie scowled at her and stomped back onto the bus,
grumbling under his breath. The rest of them filed in behind him and
Ernie barely let them get seated before the bus took off again,
sending up a spray of the riverbed sand and gravel before the bus
lurched onto the road again. It wasn't long before Ernie brought
the bus to a rapid halt and the occupants of the bus nearly went
flying out of their seats.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
gets a bit reckless when he's grumpy," muttered Bert as she held
out a hand to Jonathon to haul him off the floor. Once standing
Jonathon held onto her hand for just a moment longer than was
necessary and neither seemed to notice that they were standing closer
than they needed to. Jonathon bent his head ever so slightly; the two
of them seemed to have forgotten that anyone else was there.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
all right?" asked Jonathon quietly. "Didn't, you know, sustain
an injury when the doofus stopped like that?" Bert shook her head
slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah,
I'm fine." Harry dared not move or breathe; this was likely the
moment they had been waiting for, probably for years.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
let's go if we're goin'!" yelled Ernie from the front of the
bus. The spell was broken and Jonathon and Bert hastily dropped hands
and Bert turned to Ernie businesslike while Jonathon busied himself
studying a pulled thread on his jumper. They filed off the bus onto a
dusty, red road, joined by young Arkie (who proved to be anything but
young but apparently his father was one hundred and fifty seven so
young Arkie's one hundred and two was indeed young).</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
it's beautiful," breathed Hermione, pointing to the large
monolith in the distance.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ern,
why don't you take us up to the Rock and go see your mum? Me and
Bert'll show the Poms what it's about," said Bert, she turned
to young Arkie. "You wanna come Ark, or you gunna get a drink?"
Young Arkie nodded briefly at a nearby building and Bert nodded,
promising to pick him up before they left.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum'll
be put out if you don' come and visit her," stated Ernie
categorically to Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay,
so you come and pick us up from the Rock in about an hour then, take
us back to see your mum," sighed Jonathon. "But you're not
getting out of havin' a nice visit with her without us lot nosin'
in on it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
well I hope cousin Gracie's there when you turn up then,"
grumbled Ernie as headed back onto the bus. Cousin Gracie turned out
to be one of Ernie's many relatives who had taken a particular
shine to Jonathon on a previous visit and was rather â€¦
enthusiastic.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know how you feel," said Harry quietly, not seeing Ginny shoot him
a sharp look. "Enthusiastic girls are a bit â€¦ wearing."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
don't you get yourself a real live girl, then?" asked George
pointedly tilting his head imperceptibly towards Bert, who was waving
her arms at Uluru and explaining something to Hermione. "What's
she going to do if you waltz in with a bird on your arm?" Jonathon
glared at him before hissing,</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
be so bloody obvious!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
be so bloody idiotic!" George said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
he's always idiotic," said Bert smiling. "Come on, let's go."</p><p class="calibre8">Standing
at the base of the huge red rock Harry felt infinitesimally small.
The rough, red walls rose up into the sky stopping abruptly, sharply
against the azure sky. From far away you couldn't see that the base
of Uluru was surrounded by trees through which birds squawked and
invisible skinks and insects rustled and buzzed. The giant red
monolith rose up out of the flat plain as if it had been dropped from
the sky and colonies of plants and creatures had made their home in
the bush that thrived in the watercourses created by the rare rain
that ran off the rock and collected at its base. The yellowing grass
reached their knees, waving in a silent breeze that rippled through
the trees. A red gravelly path wound its way around the rock and a
chain leading up to the top was providing purchase for a number of
Muggles winding their way up and down a worn path. The atmosphere was
still despite the presence of so many tourists and Uluru gave of a
feeling of quiet reverence that Harry had not felt before. The
immense monument to nature made Harry appreciate the vastness of this
continent in a way that could not be conveyed with anything else he
had seen to date. The flat plain around them stretched for miles and
miles and on the red horizon he could see only distant hills and
dunes, fuzzy in the distance and heat haze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ernie's
mob don't climb the rock," Jonathon was saying when Harry forced
his attention back to their group. "They let the tourists have a go
up it if they want but this is a sacred place, y'know? I think it's
a truly grouse place, it's one of them places that you can feel is
magical if you get my meaning but I 'aint ever gunna climb it. It's
just not right I reckon, heaps more to see around the base anyway.
Probably can't get around the whole thing in an hour but we can
have a go â€“ Ernie'll find us when he gets away from his mum."
Entwining his fingers with Ginny's, Harry trailed after Jonathon
with the rest of them while Jonathon told them stories that he'd
learned from Ernie's uncles.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
used to come here for part of the summer," Jonathon explained.
"After Christmas, me mum'd never let us come for Christmas, but
me and Dave used to join him up here and his uncles'd take us out
and tell us the stories. It looks fabulous right after it's been
raining." He stopped at a bend in the path and beckoned them into a
small alcove at the base. A viewing platform was set up overlooking a
small pool of water.</p><p class="calibre8">"See
here, that trail, the water comes down there and fills this pool,"
Jonathon indicated the water collected on the rocks in front of them.
"The Rainbow Serpent, he made this whole thing and there were a
coupla other snakes, slithering over the rock, made all them grooves
for the water to come down now and that makes the waterhole for the
birds and animals. I haven't been out here for ages, forgotten half
the story." Jonathon shook his head sadly before staring out over
the water as he leaned on one of the railings edging the platform.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lucky
we have any stories really," said Bert softly, covering one of
Jonathon's hands with her own. "You're a good friend, Jonathon.
Ernie don't expect you to remember all the stories, but if you came
out with us more often, maybe he'd tell them to you more and you'd
remember them. You got caught up in the big city life. You don't
come out here with us as much as you used to.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
know Ernie doesn't feel like he fits in sometimes. He feels like
you're a bridge between his two worlds. He's luckier than most
though. At least his mob is willing to believe in magic and accept
it." Bert sighed wistfully then and Jonathon turned to her,
reaching out to cup her cheek tenderly. Harry felt the subtext of
their conversation flowing round them and stood motionless while Bert
closed her eyes and sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
dad'll come around," said Jonathon softly. "You can't expect
him to get over having his whole house vanished in a fit of teenage
pique, and being homeless for three days, very easily." Bert smiled
weakly as she opened her eyes to look up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't mean to do it," she said, staring into Jonathon's eyes.
"But Alastair really wasn't as bad as he made out." Jonathon
laughed softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
he was your dad's first introduction to a wizard other than the
headmaster it's no wonder he went off his trolley about the
prospect of his sixteen year old daughter marrying one," he smiled.
"You need to introduce him to someone else, someone who's worthy
of you. Someone your dad already likes."</p><p class="calibre8">"The
only one of my magical friends dad really likes is you," said Bert
wistfully, looking out across the waterhole, turning her face in the
palm of his hand. "So I've got buckley's of that ..." she
trailed off as Jonathon brought his other hand up to cup her face and
turn it back to him. He lowered his head slowly to hers and breathed,</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I'd say that's a real possibility. The chances are inordinately
high in fact." Bert stared at him in wonder as Jonathon moved
closer and covered her mouth with his, he kissed her softly, cupping
her face in his hands and she stood, motionless as if not believing
this was real, her hands hanging limply at her sides. Jonathon pulled
away, his eyes clouded and he dropped his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry," he murmured. "I'll just-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!"
whispered Bert fiercely. "Don't be sorry." And she reached out
and pulled his head back down to hers, this time she kissed him and
after a few moments of shock Jonathon wound his arms around her waist
and kissed her back. No one dared move, or ruin the moment, they all
sensed it had been coming for quite some time and Jonathon and Bert
kissed in the shadow of the massive rock, in one of the most magical
places in the country, for several long minutes. The stillness was
broken suddenly by a groan and the two broke apart and all spun
around to see Ernie standing on the path shaking his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"For
the love of Merlin," he said, smiling. "Could you not do that in
front of the ancestors." Jonathon blushed deeply but Bert just
grinned at him cheekily.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
I recall correctly it was <em class="calibre9">your</em>
idea that I make him mine," she said. "What was it you said I
should do? Take him to b-" Ernie leapt forward with surprising
agility and covered her mouth with his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don'
paint the picture Alberta," he shuddered and Bert laughed. She
pulled away and slugged him on the arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me that." Jonathon watched as Ernie tugged on Bert's long
hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
go," he said, grinning at Jonathon. "Mebee I can get me some
peace now she won' be moanin' about you not noticin' her all
day?" Jonathon reached out and took Bert's hand in his and she
smiled shyly at him looking through her lashes as Jonathon put an arm
around Ernie's shoulders and they led the way back to the Roobus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
be careful she don't share too much with you aye?" he said and
Ernie shuddered. The three of them wandered up to the bus bickering
softly and George looked around at his siblings walking hand in hand
with their significant others and shook his head resignedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
really need to find myself a bird. I just don't see young Arkie as
my type at all." Ron laughed and pulled George in for a one armed
hug just as they reached the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sure you'll have no trouble once we get back home," he said
reassuringly. George looked at him thoughtfully for a few moments.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you
think I can get double the women now? Surely something has to work in
my favour?" Ron threw back his head and laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think Fred would expect it. If the ladies are deprived of him then
you really need to step up to the plate!" Hermione pursed her lips
but did not say anything about the rather sexist remark because Ron
and George were laughing so uproariously that she and Harry had to
push them up the steps onto the bus and no one had seen George laugh
like that in months.</p><p class="calibre8">They
sank into their seats and Ernie adjusted his seat and started the bus
up. They took off with a bang and landed suddenly, bone jarringly a
minute later when the bus seemed to just drop onto the road with a
massive thud. Bert sat up from her deck chair suddenly, tearing her
hand away from Jonathon's abruptly as she ran up to the front of
the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Whadja
do Ern?" she gasped. Ernie shrugged, clambering out of his seat
slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Feels
like some of the magic's missin' mebee," he said with a puzzled
frown. He hopped down went around to the side of the bus, the rest of
them following him. "I told Akrie we'd be back in a minute an'
I hope this don' take too long cause we'll never get to
Yackandandah at this rate. You two an' yer silly detours."
Jonathon and Bert shared a glance over Ernie's head as he bet to
undo a clasp before they both leaned down to help him hoist open the
panel. They all peered in expectantly.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
had no idea what he was looking at, the colourful swirls and whorls
of magic moved without meaning in the space exposed by the removed
panel but Bert gasped and Jonathon shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Damn
Pukwudgies!" exploded Bert.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bugger,"
said Ernie.</p>
