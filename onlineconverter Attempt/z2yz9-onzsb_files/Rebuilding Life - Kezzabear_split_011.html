<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_12">*Chapter 11*: Chapter 11</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Funeral</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry
woke with a start and a scream dying in his throat. His heart was
pounding and he was breathing heavily, sweat pouring off his skin
like he'd just run a marathon. The sun was about to break over the
horizon and it reflected off the bright orange walls of Ron's room,
casting a warm glow over the empty bed on the other side of the room.
Just like all the other times Harry had woken that night Bill was
sitting next to his bed. Wordlessly Harry took the glass Bill offered
him, gulping down a mouthful of the fresh water before sinking back
onto his pillow and covering his eyes with one arm. He felt Bill
reach out and lay his hand on his shoulder and Harry reached a hand
up to Bill's and grasped it, his heart still pounding from the
ghastly nightmare.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
heard the door creak open and soft footsteps cross the carpet. There
was a clunk as a beaker was placed on the windowsill.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
muzzer, she has finished ze potion," he heard Fleur whisper and
then the sound of her kissing Bill softly. "Try and get 'im to
drink eet. We 'ave 'eard 'ow often 'e is waking up." Her
footsteps receded and the door shut behind her with a soft click.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
said Bill, "talk to me." Harry had not said a word to anyone
since arriving at the Burrow the night before. The wards had held
well during the time the Weasleys had been away and apart from a
thick layer of dust, all was in order, including the expulsion of the
ghoul from Ron's room. Ron and Bill had led Harry up the stairs and
into a pair of pyjamas and then into bed in
Ron's room but Harry had been unable to sleep for longer than an
hour without being woken by nightmares filled with red glowing eyes
and flashes of green light, he was falling and dying over and over
again. And when the light wasn't coming towards him he watched as
one by one those he loved fell to the green flashes. It was like
going to sleep and running into one giant Boggart. Mrs Weasley had
started making a Dreamless Sleep potion after Harry woke the fourth
time a little after midnight.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
worried about you," Bill tried again. "Please, talk to me."
Harry removed the arm from across his face and looked up at Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
terrified," he whispered, turning away to
look at the wall, "all the time; well not every single minute but a
lot. I was terrified of George. He hexed me and I was afraid of him
after that. When I ran into the business end of Charlie's wand that
day in the Entrance Hall I started to panic and then I started seeing
green lights. Every time I close my eyes to sleep I see green flashes
of light and Voldemort's eyes. It's been getting worse. Sometimes
when people talk about the war I've been getting the shakes or
reliving the times when I've seen someone killed. Reliving the
times Voldemort tried to kill me. I panicked when I saw the green
sparklers. I couldn't help it." Harry turned back to Bill. "I
think I'm going mad."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
not going mad, Harry. It's just panic attacks. A normal reaction to
everything you've been through I'd say," Bill paused. "It
happened to a mate of mine in Egypt. He got trapped in a tomb once
when things went a bit wrong and he was dead scared of small spaces
after that; couldn't go into tombs. The thought made him
hyperventilate.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've
been watching you the past couple of days. You hide it well but I
could see you shaking and your eyes glazing in panic, I just couldn't
figure out what was making you panic. And you go about telling
everyone you are fine. They believe you when you say that, you know.
Except Hermione I think she was figuring it out too. Don't cover it
up, let us help. If you're feeling panicky tell us, we can help.
Promise me, Harry." Bill's eyes were full of concern and they
pleaded with Harry to trust him.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
who's going to be here?" Harry asked. "You all live or work
someplace else. And I can't expect your mum and Ginny to deal with
me if I am going to panic about every little thing every five
minutes." Harry's breathing quickened as he continued. "I don't
know what's going to happen and everybody has got their lives to go
back to but I don't have any place to be and I can't even go five
minutes talking without-" He broke off panting, gasping, trying to
catch his breath. Bill gripped his shoulders and told him to breathe.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
one's going anywhere right now," he said firmly. "You have a
place to be – here. We are all here and we are all staying together
as a family. We need each other right now and that includes you,
kid." Bill pulled Harry into a rough hug before pushing him back
onto the pillow and drawing his covers up. "Now, you are going to
drink this potion and get some proper sleep." Harry choked the
potion down with Bill smoothing a hand through his hair as tenderly
as if he were Mrs Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"
'Mnot a kid," mumbled Harry sleepily, " 'm
nearly eighteen, 'm all grown'p." Harry's breathing evened
out and he drifted off into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p><p class="calibre8">************************</p><p class="calibre8">The
sun was streaming through the window when Harry woke again. The clock
said it was almost midday but he could smell one of Mrs Weasley's
delicious breakfasts wafting up to the little room beneath the attic.
Harry was hungry. He crawled out of bed and padded his way
downstairs. The Weasleys and Hermione were sitting around the kitchen
table eating and talking quietly. Ron looked up from his enormous
plate of sausages and bacon to spear a kipper from the middle of the
table and saw Harry standing there.</p><p class="calibre8">"Morning
Harry!" he cried. Several heads whipped around and Ginny scrambled
from her chair and ran to pull him into a hug which Harry returned
enthusiastically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
and have some breakfast before Ron eats it all," she said pulling
him over to sit into the chair between her and Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a bit late for breakfast, isn't it?" Harry asked as she and Mrs
Weasley began piling his plate high.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
well we only just got up, we didn't get much sleep last night,"
Mr Weasley said kindly. Harry looked down at his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,"
he mumbled. He felt Bill's hand on his arm and looked up at the
older man.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay, Harry, remember what I said," Bill said. Ron cocked his head
to one side.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did you say?" he demanded. Bill resumed eating, swallowing a bite
of toast before answering.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
family," said Bill simply. After a pause he added, "Awfully
polite chap though. Say Harry; reckon you could teach that to Ron?"
Ron glowered and Charlie sniggered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
as I've been unable to influence Ron, or indeed any of you in that
direction all these years, I don't like his chances," Percy said
as he primly cut his sausages into small bite sized pieces.</p><p class="calibre8">"Au
contraire Percy old chap!" exclaimed George. "I've learnt a lot
from you and your example has influenced me no end, my lad!" Percy
shot him an icy look.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
polite," Charlie protested. "Have to be when trying to impress
the ladies." He puffed his chest out. Fleur scoffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Eet
ees not <em class="calibre9">politeness</em>
that ees attractive to women!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"
said George, leaning forward. "What's the secret then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Charm,
charisma, joie de vivre," winked Bill. "That and a generous p-"</p><p class="calibre8">"William
Arthur!" hissed his mother. Charlie sniggered and Fleur blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"-urse,"
finished Bill innocently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Being
polite has always worked with Penelope," Percy said, his nose in
the air. Harry suppressed a snort with great difficulty as he saw
Charlie, George and Ron all seize that piece of information.</p><p class="calibre8">"Penelope,
huh? How about you tell us about <em class="calibre9">Penelope</em>,
Perce?" said George with an evil gleam in his eye. Ron began
singing a rather childish ditty about love and marriage under his
breath that Harry once thought he'd heard a version of on a
television show that Dudley was particularly fond of.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
said Charlie, "have you shown her your generous purse yet?" Percy
looked at Charlie with disdain.</p><p class="calibre8">"Our
relationship is suitably proper according to those who are not yet
married," he said primly.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
not talking about money, are they?" Ginny said under her breath to
Hermione as both girls giggled uncontrollably. Mrs Weasley shot a
disapproving look at Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
it's not the size of your purse then, Bill? It's how generous you
are about it?" asked George with a wink. Fleur went as red as any
Weasley and Charlie went purple with the effort of trying not to
laugh. Ron, who had obviously completely missed the double entendre,
chose that moment to add his thoughts to the conversation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
if that's all it takes then Ginny's in luck because I've seen
Harry's. It's sizable and he's generous to a fault." Harry
and Ginny collectively sprayed their pumpkin juice clear across the
table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
at least Ginny hasn't seen it yet," Charlie glared at Harry
menacingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bollocks!
Course she has!" scoffed Ron, his mother glared at him and Hermione
muttered something about his appalling language. Harry began to choke
on the bacon he just put in his mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
has not!" he wheezed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
I have Harry," said Ginny breezily. "Don't you remember?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a bit of a worry if a bloke can't remember that," muttered
George, a scowl on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right
before I went to Hogwarts, we had a look down there," she said
brightly her face gleaming with barely suppressed mischief. Harry
just looked at her in horror. He could see Hermione behind her, a
hand stuffed in her mouth to prevent her bursting into loud,
uncontrollable laughter. Ron was nodding along, his mouth full of his
tenth sausage and Bill, Charlie, Percy and George were looking at
Harry in a way that made his blood run cold. Harry appealed to
Hermione with his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
at least she's only seen it that once," Hermione said
thoughtfully. "And you're the only one who has access so we can
be sure it hasn't happened again. It's a pity I haven't had the
chance to see it. I'd love to see your family jewels."</p><p class="calibre8">"You.
Are. Not. Helping," Harry ground out but Bill now shook with silent
laughter and George and Charlie stared at Hermione with unconcealed
glee. Percy looked as though he was trying to disapprove. Ron
swallowed the last of his breakfast.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
give it up Harry, we're all big enough to deal with the size of it,
we're all grownups here," he said. "You've probably got some
really brilliant family jewels stashed in there." Harry simply
groaned and, pushing his plate to one side, put his forehead down and
began banging his head lightly on the tabletop.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
I'd like to see those!" said Ginny, collapsing into
uncontrollable giggles, Hermione following suit.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
it's okay with you if Harry shows Ginny his family jewels, Ron?"
asked Bill, his eyes now twinkling with unconcealed mirth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really
Bill –" began Mrs Weasley. But Ron interrupted her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure,"
he said, shrugging. "He should probably wait a while before he
gives her any though. They've not been going out for long. I mean,
I used to have a problem with his generosity but I like to think I've
matured a bit since then." That was enough to make Charlie and
George lose control completely and they began howling with laughter.
Ron looked at them as if they were daft before he turned to Harry,
concern on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Say
Harry, you think the goblins will let you back in to it, after the,
er, mess we made of Gringotts?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
you <em class="calibre9">are</em>
talking about my vault," said Harry weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
what did you think I was talking about? Where else would your family
jewels be – oh," Ron went scarlet.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
there it is," said George in an undertone that was quite clearly
meant to be heard.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
enough, boys," said Mr Weasley failing completely to hide his mirth
despite Mrs Weasely's glare. "Let's organise what we have to do
today. Who's going to Muriel's to collect our things and who's
going to help your mother straighten things up around here?"</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Weasley soon had Fleur, Ginny and Hermione helping her dust, change
bed linens and tidy the kitchen. She packed Ron and Harry off to the
chicken shed to clean it out for when Percy and Charlie brought the
chickens back from Muriel's. Bill apparated to Shell Cottage to
collect some things for himself and Fleur and Mr Weasley and George
headed back to Hogwarts to bring Fred home. The funeral would be the
day after tomorrow and the sobering thought considerably dampened the
enthusiasm anyone felt for the various tasks they were allocated.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
himself was completely distracted by thoughts of other funerals and
quickly excused himself to send a letter to Andromeda. First he
quickly dashed one off to Kingsley asking for the details of Snape's
funeral. He had then finished writing a letter, asking as delicately
as he'd been able, about funeral arrangements for Tonks and Remus,
when he realised he had no owl to send them anyway. He didn't know
if Remus had anything organised for his funeral arrangements but he
knew he didn't want Andromeda to have to arrange it alone.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
traipsed down the stairs mulling over his owl problem when he heard
Charlie and Percy in the kitchen. There was a great thump and a clang
before something scraped across the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
bird is a menace!" he heard Charlie say. "It's safer to be
around dragons!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
expect Muriel kept him locked up the last few days," replied Percy.
"Poor little thing needs some exercise. Where's Ron? He should
look after his owl now he's back."</p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Pigwidgeon</em>,'
thought Harry, and he raced into the kitchen to see Percy holding, in
one hand, a small cage with a tiny puffball in it, that was obviously
Ginny's pygmy puff, and a spitting hissing covered carrier basket,
that was clearly Crookshanks, in the other. Charlie was struggling
with three cages of chickens, several trunks and Pig, fluttering
about madly in his cage.</p><p class="calibre8">"Here,
let me take Pig," said Harry. "I've got letters for him."
Charlie handed the bird over gratefully and Harry made his way up to
Ron's room to stow the cage and release Pig with his letters. He
bumped into Ginny on the third landing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
are Charlie and Percy back?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
they've got Arnold and the trunks in the kitchen," Harry
answered. He made no move to continue up the staircase though, he
simply looked at Ginny. She returned his gaze, her eyes flickering
downwards briefly as she licked her lips. As Harry stood on the
staircase he realised that they hadn't actually been alone in quite
some time and he took a step towards her. Pig fluttered in his cage
much like Harry's heart was fluttering against his ribcage. He
reached out and captured her hand in his own, pulling her towards
him.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
looked up at him, her lips slightly parted and Harry felt his pulse
quicken. And then his lips were on hers and Pig was unceremoniously
dumped on a step so Harry could bury one hand in her hair while the
other found the small of her back, pressing her closer to him. He
felt her small hands slide up his shoulders and around the back of
his neck before she slid one down his spine to rest lightly on his
left hip as he opened his mouth, his tongue seeking entrance to hers.</p><p class="calibre8">The
landing was small and a little cramped, it didn't take much for
Harry to find himself pressed against the wall, one small hand
creeping up his chest and the other running softly through his hair
while his own hands found the gap between Ginny's T shirt and
shorts, tracing small circles on her bare skin. Then Harry heard
heavy footfalls on the steps below and he pulled away from her,
pulling her shirt back down and kissing her lightly on the nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on," he whispered, grabbing Ginny's hand in one of his own and
Pig's cage in the other, swiftly dragging them both upstairs to
Ron's room where he quickly tied his letter to Pig's leg and
opened the window for the tiny owl to speed off before turning back
to Ginny whose lips were still swollen and her face flushed from the
heady kiss they had shared on the landing.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
beautiful," he said softly as he reached out a hand to caress her
cheek. His other arm snaked out to pull her close to him. "I love
you." He murmured against her lips as he covered her mouth with his
own.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
had no idea how long they stood there, locked in that embrace,
sharing a kiss that made his spine tingle and all his worries fade
away. He was, however, sorry that it had to come to end when Ron
burst in, the door slamming open with a resounding crash.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
<em class="calibre9">do</em> that in
my room," Ron groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then
stop snogging Hermione in mine!" Ginny
retorted loudly. "It wasn't a pretty sight this morning let me
tell you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
and you think what I just saw paints a picture I want to see?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ronald!
Ginevra!" Mrs Weasley's voice was not at all reassuring and both
Weasleys blanched. "Stop that bickering and get yourselves down
here now! And find Harry!" The three of them made straight for the
stairs Ron muttering that he'd found Harry alright. As Ron
clattered loudly down the stairs, Harry on his heels, Ginny tugged on
Harry's hand, stopping his descent. He turned enquiringly to her to
find her looking at him tenderly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
love you too," she whispered. Harry closed the gap between them
swiftly as he pressed his lips to hers once more, the kiss sweet and
tender until it was broken by Ron's voice drifting back to them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!
Don't do it on my landing either!"</p><p class="calibre8">The
three of them clattered down the stairs and found a trembling Mrs
Weasley in the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
father firecalled," she murmured, staring into the fireplace.
"George has had some sort of breakdown. They are going to be a
while longer. Madam Pomfrey is still watching him." Suddenly she
stood up and headed for the living room. Ron jumped out of the
doorway as she headed through it determinedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
now Ronald," his mother cut him off briskly. She picked up a
feather duster that was lying on one of the bookshelves. "I need to
clean up so that we have somewhere nice to put … to put Fred."
She began to dust frantically and rather than cleaning effectively
she created clouds of dust. Ginny pulled Ron aside and spoke to him
in a whisper.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
is she doing?" Ginny asked. "She never dusts with a duster, she
uses her wand, the duster is for underage serfs like me!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
dunno, Ginny," shrugged Ron. "But yeah it is a bit odd." The
two of them and Harry watched as Mrs Weasley continued to chatter
incessantly and flick dust around the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do hope George is going to be all right," she said. "Arthur
didn't tell me what exactly was wrong with him. Of course I'm not
sure he knew, but he could have asked Madam Pomfrey. I hope it's
not serious. Do you think it will be serious Ronald?" She turned on
him so quickly that Ron actually took a step backwards.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
dunno, Mum," he said and opened his mouth to say more but was cut
off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Charlie
and Percy went back to Muriel's," she burst out. "They have to
clean up the room Fr-Fred and George were using. Those boys left a
cauldron running! Just wait until I …"</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Weasley began to wave the duster more erratically. Ginny ran out of
the room mumbling something about getting Fleur. Ron and Harry stood
helplessly in the sitting room doorway watching Mrs Weasley wield her
duster fiercely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum?"
started Ron tentatively. Mrs Weasley shook violently and half the
pictures on the mantelpiece that she was dusting fell with a crash to
the floor. Mrs Weasley stood, staring at the pictures, their glass
faces lying cracked on the floor, a picture of two identical cherubic
red headed babies laughing up at her. She sank to her knees amidst
the shattered glass, reaching out to pick up the picture of the
laughing babies.</p><p class="calibre8">The
glass hanging from the frame sliced into her skin, but she didn't
seem to notice and the blood dripped from her hand sinking into the
threadbare carpet, mingling with the swirls and loops already woven
into the faded pattern. Ron crossed the floor in two short strides,
kneeling with his mother in the glass fragments.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
– I'll get something for that cut," Harry stammered. He hurried
into the kitchen and found Ginny, Fleur and Hermione quickly making a
pot of tea.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bandages,"
he blurted at Ginny. "Your mum cut herself." Ginny blanched and
hurried to collect a box from a shelf before hurrying into the
sitting room with Hermione on her heels.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
wish Beel would 'urry up and come back," Fleur said wistfully,
staring at the fireplace as if she could make him magically Floo in.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
don't you take that in to the living room? I'll firecall him, let
him know Mum needs him," said Harry. Fleur nodded, gathering the
tea things, and stepped quietly into the living room. Harry swiftly
knelt at the hearth and stuck his head in.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill!
You've got to come home!" he called frantically. Harry could hear
his footsteps hurrying in from the other room.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
mum," said Harry. "She's … sort of had a turn."</p><p class="calibre8">Bill
swore and promised he'd be only a few minutes longer. Harry
withdrew his head from the fireplace and went back to the living room
where he found Ron and his mother still kneeling in the ruins of the
photograph frames while Hermione and Fleur tried to convince Mrs
Weasley to come and sit where they could clean and bandage her cut.
Ginny was standing shaking and watching her mother cry silently, Mrs
Weasley's tears mingling with the blood still dripping to the
floor. His heart breaking, Harry enveloped Ginny in a hug as Ron
managed to coax his mother to her feet, still clutching the broken
picture frame that held a picture of laughing twin babies. By the
time Bill came racing into the room Hermione had repaired the picture
frames and was putting them back on the mantelpiece, Fleur had
cleaned and bandaged the cut and Ron had removed all the shards of
glass from the picture frame Mrs Weasley still clung to.</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Weasley was now sitting next to Ron on the couch staring at the
picture, tears still slipping slowly down her cheeks and the front of
Harry's shirt was wet with Ginny's tears. Bill knelt in front of
his mother, putting a hand over hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum?"
he whispered. Mrs Weasley did not look up.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
need your father," she said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
go," said Ron. "I'll send dad back. I'll bring George and
F-Fred home." Mrs Weasley patted his knee.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
a good boy, Ronald," she said softly. Ron got up and Hermione went
to follow him but Ron shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Please,"
he said, "please stay with them." He indicated Fleur standing
helplessly next to the tea service, Ginny sobbing in Harry's arms
and Bill still kneeling motionless in front of their mother who had
not stopped staring at the picture of Fred and George as babies.
Harry met Hermione's eyes over the top of Ginny's head and he
knew that they were both aware that someone needed to hold things
together right now, and it wasn't going to be a Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
gave Ron a swift hug and kissed his cheek as he left to go to
Hogwarts and then began to straighten out the living room, pushing
Fleur into a chair and handing out cups of tea. The crash of the
kitchen door as it opened shattered the stillness of the now
sparkling living room where Mrs Weasley still stared, motionless, at
the laughing babies and Ginny was sniffing away the last of her tears
as Harry stroked her hair. Mr Weasley soon came rushing in looking
extremely haggard and gathered his wife in his arms as she unleashed
a fresh wave of tears. This seemed to set Ginny off again who flew at
her parents and they gathered her in, Mr Weasley rocking both of them
as his own tears dripped down the end of his nose, reminding Harry
painfully of Ron at Dumbledore's funeral a year previously.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
looked helplessly at Harry as Bill simply moved to Fleur, now that
his vigil over his mother was no longer necessary and Harry watched
as he laid his head in his wife's lap seeking her comfort. A crash
and an oath from the kitchen startled Harry out of his reverie and he
and Hermione dashed into the kitchen to see Percy and Charlie in a
heap on the floor having just come through the Floo – a cloud of
ash and dust rising from their robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
prat! Why on earth would you jump in before I'd cleared out?"
Charlie said angrily. "I reckon you've broken my foot with your
great hefty feet!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
it isn't my fault Muriel went spare when we couldn't stop that
swamp box! She practically shoved me on top of you, screaming at me,"
Percy bellowed back. "Now move out of the way she's going to
shove everything else through any minute do you want to be in the way
when she manages it?" They were too late. An avalanche of WWW
products tumbled out of the kitchen fireplace just as Bill and Mr
Weasley burst in the door. They stumbled into Harry and sent him
careening into the kitchen table. Charlie and Percy lay buried under
boxes of Skiving Snackboxes, WonderWitch products and Patented
Daydream Charms and the ash from the fireplace rose ever higher in
the chaos.</p><p class="calibre8">It
seemed to Harry that things couldn't get any worse when he saw a
silver panther drop gracefully through the kitchen ceiling and perch
on the teetering pile of boxes to say, in Kingsley's voice,</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Arthur,
I sent your boys home in a Ministry car. They'll be there any
minute."</em> The last time Harry had seen
Kingsley's Patronus at The Burrow it signaled a Death Eater attack
and between being winded after crashing into the Weasley's kitchen
table and fighting down a surge of panic at the memory of the attack
Harry's composure was lost. He sank to the kitchen floor gasping
desperately for air just as the kitchen door swung open to reveal Ron
silhouetted against the afternoon light.</p><p class="calibre8">The
panther dissipated and Percy and Charlie scrambled to their feet as
one final box came flying through the kitchen fireplace, hitting the
opposite wall with a resounding splat and burst open splattering the
kitchen's occupants with its contents and rapidly filling the
kitchen with an oozing green swamp.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
great," muttered Percy. "We couldn't fix the one in Muriel's
second best bedroom and now there's one in mum's kitchen!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you had to go and have a poke about in the boxes didn't you!"
spat Charlie. "I bet she hurled that one through on purpose!"
Harry was still trying to calm his racing heart and regulate his
breathing but Bill saw his battle and was by Harry's side in one
huge step, helping him focus and breathe while the swamp slowly oozed
over the sink and into the scullery.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bloody
hell!" exclaimed Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Language,
Ronald!" scolded Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
are we going to fix this before mum finds it?" hissed Percy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Finds
what?" asked Mrs Weasley who was looking decidedly more composed,
although her eyes were red rimmed, now standing in the doorway.
"What's wrong with Harry?" Harry felt six pairs of eyes swing
towards him as he fought down another wave of fear and began to
control his breathing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kingsley's
Patronus," muttered Bill. "He's alright, it was a short
attack." Harry closed his eyes, obviously they all knew about his
panic attacks because no one asked for clarification. Suddenly Harry
heard a snort of laughter coming from the direction of the back door
and opened his eyes to find George, looking somewhat pale, doubled
over with mirth.</p><p class="calibre8">"George?"
asked Mr Weasley hesitantly, "are you alright?" George
straightened up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
Dad, I am," he replied. "Seeing Perce and Charlie covered in soot
and green ooze it's just like old times. You guys sure know how to
cheer a bloke up."</p><p class="calibre8">A
blob of green slime hung precariously from Percy's nose as he
straightened up and puffed out his chest as if personally responsible
for George's cheery façade. The blob of green slime fell to the
floor and made a sucking sound on the floor as it took root and began
to transform the hearth into a swamp. The sight of a soot covered
Percy standing officiously in front of the kitchen fireplace, up to
his ankles in a swamp, with bits of green slime still clinging to his
hair and coating his glasses was so absurdly funny that soon the
occupants of the kitchen were all laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
and Fleur came in to see what was causing the laughter and Ginny
found it particularly funny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
if Fred could see you now," she wheezed. "He once told me that
nothing would give him greater pleasure than to swamp you, Percy."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
no doubt," said Percy drily. "He obviously waited for that
opportunity. We are treated to this spectacle, courtesy of Fred, who
wrote in big letters on a box, <em class="calibre9">'Dear
Percy, Don't open this box, Love Fred'</em>.
I, of course, am apparently unable to resist such a message." Percy
appeared to be looking disdainfully at himself, if that was at all
possible, as he attempted to wipe his hands on his filthy robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I'll be," said George wonderingly. "He won the bet. Ten
Galleons I said you'd ignore that message if you ever came across
it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Eet
would appear, Percy, as eef you are Fred's last prank, non?"
giggled Fleur.</p><p class="calibre8">"Couldn't
happen to a better bloke, old chap!" cried George. Percy just shook
his head muttering that mashed parsnips were preferable.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
well, we can't eat dinner in a swamp," Mrs Weasley fussed.
"George, dear do you think you could possibly get rid of this, er,
product?"</p><p class="calibre8">The
mood in The Burrow lifted and although bringing Fred home and
situating his lifeless body in the living room was not without tears
and sadness it felt, to Harry, like certain ghosts had been purged
along with the tears that had been shed that afternoon and that
rather than Fred's spectre hanging over them like a dark cloud his
memory enveloped them like a familiar blanket, beginning to chase the
sorrow out of the dark corners of their souls that they had all tried
to cover up and hide.</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">The
next day was a solemn affair. George spent the day in his room while
his father and brothers prepared the site chosen for Fred's grave
near a grove of trees that bordered the garden. Harry had spent
another restless night dodging nightmares. Seeing his pale face Mrs
Weasley had tucked him into a cozy chair near the kitchen hearth and
plied him with hot drinks and soup and Harry was simply too tired to
protest. She fussed over him, keeping herself busy as she tucked a
blanket around his shoulders and felt his forehead. Harry reflected
that perhaps Professor McGonagall's admonition to let Molly Weasley
mother him had not been for himself, but for her. He let himself be
comforted and mothered and found that his nightmares were a little
less that night.</p><p class="calibre8">The
day of Fred's funeral dawned clear and cloudless. George emerged
from his room, resplendent in flamboyant robes of bright purple which
clashed splendidly with his hair. His mother looked at him sideways
all through breakfast but chose not to say anything at all. The rest
of The Burrow's occupants were attired more sedately in stiff dress
robes in muted colours. As they finished the meal Ron turned to
Harry,</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know how I am going stick it out in these robes all day,"
he muttered, pulling at his collar.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then
why are you wearing them, Ron?" George asked pointedly. Ron
stammered and stumbled over a hopelessly garbled explanation about
propriety and decorum and fear of his mother.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
you think that Fred possessed either propriety or decorum?" George
enquired, and added in an undertone, "I'll give you healthy fear
of the matriarch." Ron considered this for a moment while George
continued.</p><p class="calibre8">"Remember
what Fred said at Bill's wedding?" Ron shook his head. "He said
that when he got married he wouldn't be bothering with all the
nonsense and we could all wear what we liked. I know he won't be
getting married but…" George trailed off, staring at the
fireplace where Harry cold see a small patch of swamp still hidden
behind the kindling box that Mrs Weasley clearly hadn't noticed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right,
er, well, I'll be right back," Ron said in a rush and bolted out
of the kitchen, thundering up the stairs. He emerged a few moments
later in a pair of Muggle jeans, his trainers and a blindingly orange
T shirt with a cannonball whizzing across the back. George smiled at
him and winked. Mrs Weasley sighed, but there was the ghost of a
smile on her face.</p><p class="calibre8">When
the Weasley family gathered out in the yard to greet those who had
come to pay their respects and give their condolences they were an
eclectic group. Fleur and Hermione had donned sun dresses of fuchsia
and cerulean blue and Ginny was wearing a floaty green skirt and a
summer blouse. Charlie wore a bright red shirt with a fire breathing
dragon roaring on the back and Bill, an extra large fang in his ear,
had on his favourite dragonhide jacket, Mr Weasley was in his best
Muggle tweed suit and Mrs Weasley was wearing the sparkly midnight
blue witches' hat that Fred and George had given her for Christmas
in Harry's sixth year. Percy was still wearing his navy blue dress
robes.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
had changed into comfortable jeans and a T shirt and was hanging back
near the house as he watched people arrive. The first person to
arrive had been a rather giggly witch who had headed straight for
him, fawning over him rather embarrassingly and as such he now chose
not to be immediately visible to the people who were streaming in The
Burrow's gate. Harry soon spotted a large group of his schoolmates
surrounding Ron and George near one of the hedges and made his way
over. Ron hadn't left George's side all day and they had now been
joined by Lee Jordan attired in rather
garish robes of salmon pink. The three of
them clashed magnificently.</p><p class="calibre8">"All
right, Harry?" asked Neville as he spotted Harry approaching. Harry
shrugged. "I mean you left pretty suddenly the other night and –
"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
fine Neville," Harry cut him off abruptly and the other boy
swallowed whatever he had been about to say and nodded. Luna floated
over to them, clad in voluminous yellow robes, dragging Dean Thomas
by the hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello,
Harry," she said dreamily. "Have you gotten rid of the
Wrackspurts and Nargles yet?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Er-"
began Harry, quite used to her odd outbursts, but speechless all the
same.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've
never seen an attack quite so bad as that before, I expect it was the
effect of them combined. Are you quite sure you are all right now?"
Luna pressed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
fine, thank you, Luna," Harry managed to say before he was suddenly
engulfed by a pair of arms swathed in massive black robes, an
enormous black feather swung in his face, tickling his nose
mercilessly. He was ruthlessly pushed away by the arms and inspected
fiercely by none other than Auntie Muriel. Harry caught Ginny's eye
over Muriel's shoulder and Ginny was looking at him apologetically
and mouthing sorry at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
Ronald, you weren't boasting at all were you. Seems you do know
him," she eyed Harry critically. "Harry Potter, my you are quite
a bit skinnier than I thought you'd be. Hmmm your eyesight's
obviously not much to write home about, dreadfully thick lenses
there." Harry tried desperately to keep a straight face as he
caught Ginny collapsing with laughter, Ron turning puce with the
effort of holding in his hilarity and Neville staring agog at the
back of Auntie Muriel's head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
to worry!" Muriel boomed as she pulled him back into a suffocating
hug and patting him forcefully on the back. "Obviously one can
overlook these flaws, you dear, dear boy."</p><p class="calibre8">Muriel
burst into loud tears, squeezing Harry so tight that he thought he
was going to pass out. Between sobs Muriel endlessly pontificated
about the incomparable service Harry had done the wizarding world and
that he was to be esteemed among all men for his outstanding courage.
She eventually released him before turning to George and patting him
forcefully on the head muttering about his ears and then she rounded
on Ginny who backed away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginevra,
have you found yourself a beau yet? I can recommend several decent
young men that you can correspond with during your final year of
education, if you insist on returning of course," said Muriel
loudly, catching the attention of Ginny's parents. "You'll have
several suitors lined up for your parents to choose from when you
finish then. Wouldn't do to leave you on the shelf!" Ginny rolled
her eyes discreetly and Mr Weasley and Mrs Weasley hurried over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
Muriel, wonderful to see you, wonderful," began Mr Weasley and
Muriel turned to him, looking him up and down.</p><p class="calibre8">"Arthur,"
she barked, "one does not say it is wonderful to see one at a
<em class="calibre9">funeral</em>.
Have you selected any beaux for Ginevra yet? There's a rather
wonderful young man I was sorry I didn't get to introduce her to
before she ran off with her brothers a couple of days ago, perhaps I
could bring him around, you know, get things started." She winked
conspiratorially at Mr Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
very sweet of you, Auntie Muriel," said Mrs Weasley breathlessly.
"We do, er, that is to say, ah, Ginny is, well-"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
mum means to say," said George, "is that young Ginny here is
currently being, ah, courted, yes courted, by a young man of um
exceptional breeding and it is going to be entirely her choice if,
well, she lets him, sort of, well that is to say…" George trailed
off. The look he gave Ron and Harry seemed to be begging them to say
something.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
makes me sound like a stud animal," muttered Harry under his breath
to Ron who snorted indelicately.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
fine, thank you, Auntie Muriel," said Ginny. "As George said just
now, I do currently have a boyfriend."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
yes," Muriel waved her hand dismissively. "I suppose he's some
ruffian of no account without name or family, or money for that
matter. Boyfriends don't get you married though. Proper suitors
chosen by your elders and betters are what you need. Molly, I do hope
you are not encouraging this flight of fancy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"As
a matter of fact, Muriel," Mrs Weasley said stiffly, "Arthur and
I are quite pleased with <em class="calibre9">Ginevra's
choice</em> and she certainly doesn't need
our interference in the affairs of her heart. Perhaps this
conversation could be had at a more suitable time."</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
no, let's continue," said George cheekily. "No better time like
the present, would someone care to introduce Auntie Muriel here to
young Ginevra's Romeo?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
he's here is he?" Muriel peered at the assembled crowd which
included, at the forefront, a salmon pink and dreadlocked Lee, a pale
and trembling Neville and a rather scruffy looking Seamus Finnegan.
"Well, which of you degenerates is it?" Harry glared at George
before shoving his hands in his pockets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me,"
he said quietly. Auntie Muriel's resulting astonishment rendered
her speechless, and possibly gasping for air. Mr and Mrs Weasley were
able to pull her away and sit her down, ready to begin proceedings.</p><p class="calibre8">"Priceless,
Harry, priceless," said George thumping Harry on the back. "Come
on, let's get this party started."</p><p class="calibre8">People
were slowly seating themselves at the graveside as George headed into
the house, followed by his brothers. Harry went over to Ginny as the
group surrounding them went to take their seats.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
are you doing?" he asked her softly as he put his arms around her
waist, pulling her towards him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
okay," she answered. "I'm sorry about Auntie Muriel. She sort
of spotted you and swept over here like a giant vulture before I
could stop her." Harry smiled at her as he tucked a lock of hair
behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
okay, I have to get used to people wanting a piece of me," said
Harry. "But I promise that there's always one piece of me that's
only for you; this piece here." And Harry put her hand over his
heart as he bent to kiss her lightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd
better get inside, they'll be waiting for you," said Ginny,
smiling and just a little flushed. Harry looked at her, confused.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
we need to go and sit down so they can start," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
goodness, no one told you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Told
me what?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Merlin," Ginny seemed flustered. She seemed to cast her eyes wildly
about as if looking for a way to avoid what she was about to say.
Finally she forced it out. "The coffin, it needs six pallbearers."
Harry paled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
supposed to be one of them; didn't any of those idiots say
anything?" Harry shook his head. At that moment Ron stuck his head
out of The Burrow's back door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!
Potter!" he yelled. Ginny gave him a little push in the direction
of the house and Harry slowly walked over to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you waiting for?" Ron demanded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone
to tell me I was supposed to be in there," Harry shot back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Weren't
you listening last night when dad said 'you boys, his brothers,
will be the pallbearers'?" Ron grabbed Harry by one arm and
hauled him through the house and into the living room where four red
headed men were gathered around Fred's open coffin.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't know that meant <em class="calibre9">me</em>,"
whispered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
daft," grumbled Ron. Both of them stopped to watch as George
reached out and placed something in the coffin that most closely
resembled a piece of string and Harry realised it was an Extendable
Ear. George sighed heavily and a lone tear dripped down his face and
into the coffin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodbye,
Fred," he whispered. "I promise that I will keep getting up to no
good." And George lowered the lid of the coffin, wiping his face
with the back of his hand and turned to face his brothers. "Let's
go then."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
was sure that none of their faces were dry as they carried Fred
slowly up the aisle between the chairs set out facing the grave. When
they arrived at the front the tufty haired little man again stood
waiting to begin and Bill levitated the coffin above the freshly dug
grave. It hung there as if suspended on invisible threads as they
took seats next to Mr and Mrs Weasley and Ginny in the front row. As
Harry sat next to her, Ginny turned to him, tears spilled down her
cheeks and Harry simply gathered her into his arms. Harry held her
while she cried; their tears mingled as the little tufty haired man
in stiff black robes began to address the assembled crowd.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
hadn't been to many funerals but he was fairly certain that most
funerals were not like Fred's. He was fairly certain that at most
funerals the somber officiator dressed in black was not interrupted
by a loud red head proclaiming that none of all those fancy words
meant anything. He was fairly certain that most funerals did not
involve an emotional young man dressed in bright purple recounting
all the finest exploits of the one whose life they were honouring and
celebrating that day. He was fairly certain that most funerals did
not involve playing loud Muggle rock music as the coffin was lowered
either.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
felt he rather preferred a funeral that was not like most others
were.</p><p class="calibre8">Later
that day, after all the mourners had gone home and the family sat
limply inside while Hermione and Mr and Mrs Diggory cleaned up the
kitchen Harry slipped outside, looking for George who had not been
seen in the last hour. Harry found him, kneeling in front of the
fresh mound of earth under which Fred lay, tracing the letters on
Fred's headstone with his fingers.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not much is it, to show for a life," said George quietly. "Your
name and your birth and death date." Harry knelt down beside George
and looked at the white stone monument that had been placed at the
head of Fred's grave.</p><p class="calibre7">FRED WEASLEY</p><p class="calibre7">1 April 1978 – 29 May 1998</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
thought of the words he had inscribed on Dobby's headstone and the
phrase that was on his parents'.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
want to add something to it," he said quietly. "Something that
tells you about Fred and what he did with his life." Harry
remembered George's words as he'd closed the lid on the coffin
and he drew his wand. In precise neat lettering he etched a final
phrase on Fred's headstone.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">I solemnly swear that I am up to no good</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">***</em></p><p class="calibre8">Two
days after Fred's funeral the Weasley's gathered at Godric's
Hollow. Andromeda had replied to Harry with the news that Remus and
Tonks had not made any sort of funeral arrangements and as she no
longer had access to the Black family mausoleum and her husband had
been hastily buried in a Muggle churchyard during the war Andromeda
was actually entirely unsure what she was going to do. Nor was she
sure she would be able to fund it. Harry had Flooed over straight
away and convinced Andromeda to let him take care of it. She had been
very understanding about Harry's desire to bury Remus with his own
parents and agreed immediately that her daughter also be laid to rest
there.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
discovered that he was able to still access his vault (which gave
Charlie and George plenty of ammunition to tease Ron, asking him if
he'd like to go and have a look at Harry's family jewels). Harry
was entirely unwilling to enter Diagon Alley and be seen in public
only one week after the Battle of Hogwarts and not all that keen on
trying to go into Gringotts given that the last time he was there he
stole their dragon. The benefit of sending Bill was made clear when
he returned and revealed he and Fleur were both still gainfully
employed. Harry left the funeral service arrangements to Andromeda
and arranged payment for the graves, headstones and caskets. It was a
lot to do in one day but his name made it very easy indeed.</p><p class="calibre8">Kingsley
sent Harry back a short note saying that unless a relative claimed
Snape's body it would be up to the Ministry to arrange his burial.
There was a month in which his relatives could claim him, after that
it was up to the Ministry. Kinglsey also ensured that they were
concealed from the press during Remus and Tonks's funeral and sent
Ministry cars with dark windows for the day. A few well placed
Confundus charms and a couple of burly Aurors ensured safe passage
into the graveyard where a tall, thin wizard that Harry had never
seen before conducted a short service. A light breeze ruffled the
trees as Harry and the Weasley brothers carried first Tonks, and then
Remus to the new graves that had been dug next to Lily and James. At
first Harry stared unseeing as the tall, thin man began to talk but
then his eyes drifted towards his parents' headstone and he read
the words inscribed there over and over. Through the previous two
days and the whole process of arranging the funerals and arriving at
Godric's Hollow, Harry kept up an emotionless mask, shoving his
feelings deep inside, refusing to feel anything. He arranged things
mechanically, ate without tasting and it was only in his dreams that
he felt anything at all. In the mornings he put his mask back on and
wore it without cracking. Now that he was finally standing, for only
the second time, in front of his parents' graves, listening to the
accolades for two more lives sacrificed for the love of a baby son,
the mask slipped.</p><p class="calibre8">Knowing
the events that had occurred the last time she and Harry had ventured
here alone, Hermione had kept very close to Harry. As Harry's tears
began to fall Hermione reached out and grabbed the hand that wasn't
encased in Ginny's, holding onto it until the tall, thin man had
finished talking and the caskets were being lowered. Following the
service workers arrived to fill the graves and erect the headstones.
Not able to bear watching, but wanting to see the headstones in place
Harry contemplated Teddy for a moment, who was cradled in Ginny's
arms, the baby happy and blissfully unaware of how sad this day made
everyone else.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
so different seeing this place in the daylight and not covered in
snow," he heard Hermione say to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
exactly were you here?" asked Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Christmas
Eve," replied Hermione. "It was beautiful in its own way then but
it looks so much different now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
you ever been here, Ginny?" Harry suddenly asked, turning towards
them. Ginny shook her head and a slight blush rose on her cheeks.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wanted
to though, didn't you squirt?" interrupted Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me squirt!" Ginny seethed and she shot Charlie a glare that
Harry knew had nothing to do with being called squirt. Harry had an
idea why she blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on!" he said suddenly. "Let's go see it!" Charlie and Ginny
looked at him, puzzled.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you want to see Harry, dear?" Mrs Weasley enquired.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll
see," Harry's eyes were alight with mischief and he grabbed
Ginny's hand and pulled her towards the gate. "Come on!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!
If you go out there, well … there's people out there and they'll
see you!" Ginny exclaimed. Harry considered this for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
let's all go then, including those two," and he indicated the
Aurors standing near the Ministry cars. Harry could see that they all
thought he'd finally lost his marbles. He shook his head. "I'm
perfectly fine. I want to show you something. It's cool. Come on!"
The Weasleys and Andromeda followed him dubiously and the Aurors
brought up the rear and Harry led them out of the gate and emerged
into the square where the statue stood.</p><p class="calibre8">"Odd
how those people are having a look at that big square thing there,"
said Ron. "What on earth is it anyway?" Harry grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
and see," he said mysteriously. As they drew closer to the obelisk
in the centre of the square Harry watched it transform into the
statue and heard the gasps of those around him as it did so.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
really is there," muttered Ginny and she wandered towards it in
wonder. Harry held her hand and trailed after her. No one in the
crowd noticed them at first. Ginny gazed up at the statue of Harry
and his parents, Teddy blowing bubbles in her arms. Harry slipped an
arm around her waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!"
said Ron suddenly, loudly. "Harry, you look just like the statue
standing there like that!" And suddenly the people in the square
turned to look at them.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
spent two hours, shaking hands and talking to people. He didn't
mind. The sunshine beat down pleasantly on the little square and
birds and insects hovered and buzzed on the edges. After Harry
thought he had spoken to every possible person in the little square
he felt a tug on the edge of his robes. Looking down he saw a little
boy with impossibly big blue eyes and curly blonde hair looking up at
him solemnly. Harry smiled at the little boy who just stared back at
him. Harry squatted down to the boy's level.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello,
my name's Harry," he said. "What's yours?" The little boy
just looked at him before suddenly throwing his arms around Harry's
neck. Harry put his arms around the little boy and hugged him back.
When he pulled away the little boy smiled shyly at him and scampered
off. Harry looked up from where he was still hunkered down near the
ground to see Ginny looking at him, a soft smile on her face. Teddy
had long since been passed back to his grandmother who had taken him
home, so Harry went over to her, gathering her in a hug. Ginny
sighed, putting her arms around him and snuggling into his chest.
Harry stared after the little boy as he was swung onto his father's
shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
want to have kids some day," Harry said. He smiled down at Ginny as
she looked up. "I think mine will have black hair like me, or maybe
red. Red haired babies, I'd like that." And he leaned down and
kissed her softly. Their kiss was interrupted by George and Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
things are finished up mate," Ron said, jerking a thumb towards the
graveyard. "They've put the headstone up too."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
getting late," added George. "Those Aurors are looking mighty
restless." Harry took Ginny's hand in his and the four of them
made their way back into the churchyard where the rest of them were
waiting.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll
give you a minute, Harry," said Mr Weasley. "Come on you lot,
we'll wait in the cars." Harry kissed Ginny on the forehead and
told her to go on, he wouldn't be long. A new gleaming white
headstone sat next to that of his parents, Remus and Tonks's names
engraved near the top, their birth and death dates underneath. A
small man suddenly came scurrying over, carrying something wrapped in
a cloth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Terribly
sorry, Mr Potter, we about forgot this 'un," he said as he
carefully placed the parcel on the ground and unwrapped it. Inside
was a gleaming white stone. It was smaller than the other two but
matched them perfectly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay," said Harry. "Let me do it, you can go, and thank you."
The man nodded and collecting his cloth walked away. Harry levitated
the smaller stone into place between the two larger headstones, the
writing on it clear in the sunlight streaming through the trees.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">In memory of</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Sirius Black</em></p><p class="calibre7">"<em class="calibre9">Padfoot"</em></p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">1960 – 1996</em></p><p class="calibre8">Harry
heard a rustle and turned to see George standing nearby.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought they should all be together, you know?" Harry said, his
voice only a little strained. "The Marauders … well, the ones who
weren't dirty rats anyway. I know he's not really there, I can't
bury him, but they're together. They need to be together here too."
George just nodded as he stood shoulder to shoulder with Harry as the
sun slipped lower on the horizon.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
right, it's not much to show for a life, names, dates…" Harry
trailed off. He noticed George get out his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
want to add something to it," George said. "Something that tells
you something about them." Harry watched as George carefully etched
two words on the memorial for Sirius, nestled between the graves of
his two best friends. George slung his arm around Harry's shoulder
as they walked back to the cars. Harry took one last look at the
monuments, gleaming in the late afternoon sun and read the words that
George had etched.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Mischief Managed.</em></p>
