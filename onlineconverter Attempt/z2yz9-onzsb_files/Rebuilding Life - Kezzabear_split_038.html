			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">38.
Making Up</strong></p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't terribly
late when Harry arrived back in Gryffindor Tower. The common room was
still full of students. It was Friday night and even the youngest
students were still up: studying, playing Exploding Snap or listening
to the Wireless. He found Hermione sitting in a corner arm chair
reading from a dusty, old book and twisting locks of hair around her
finger, making it stand more on end than it usually did. As Harry
made his way across the common room he noticed a slight hush fall
over its inhabitants and heard what he thought might be a few
sniggers, but he ignored them as he went straight to Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's Ginny?"
he asked her quietly. Hermione looked up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" she
exclaimed. "I didn't think you'd be back until tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre8">"I need to do
something," Harry said shortly. "Where's Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She went up to
bed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Can you go and
get her for me?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can try,"
Hermione said slowly. "But Harry, I'm not sure she'll come
down."</p><p class="calibre8">"Please?"</p><p class="calibre8">"All right … but
I did warn you …" Hermione sighed, closed her book and put it on
a nearby table before heading up to the girls' dormitory. Harry
stood and watched the bottom of the staircase, waiting for Ginny to
come down. He didn't notice Neville join him and started when the
other man spoke softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She got a Howler
from Ron this evening."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione did?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No." Neville
rolled his eyes. "Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny?" Harry
asked, startled. "What-" He was interrupted by muffled shouting
and a slamming door. Hermione appeared moments later, shaking her
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"She yelled at me
and slammed the door in my face," she said.</p><p class="calibre8">"We heard that
much, Hermione," Neville said patiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" Harry
asked plaintively.</p><p class="calibre8">"She blames me for
the Howler," Hermione admitted, shifting restlessly on the bottom
step.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Howler …
the one from Ron?" Harry asked, wishing they'd get to the point.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Neville
explained. "It was pretty embarrassing."</p><p class="calibre8">"Since when does
Ron know how to make a Howler?" Harry asked, exasperated. "And
why would he send one to Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I wrote to Ron,"
Hermione said quietly. "I told him what Brogan's been going about
saying. I think Ron might have gotten the idea that Ginny believed
him." Harry groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor Fiesche
was not impressed," Neville added.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's he got
to do with it?" Harry turned to Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, he was sort
of standing nearby when Ginny tried to drench it to make it stop,"
Neville explained, failing to keep a straight face. Harry smiled
ruefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh dear," Harry
murmured, smiling slightly. "His cat …?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Screeched and
leapt off his head," Hermione admitted with a grin. "It was
actually pretty funny."</p><p class="calibre8">"The detention
wasn't though," Neville sobered. "She's threatened Ron's
manhood multiple times since we came back from tea."</p><p class="calibre8">"Fiesche gave her
detention?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah."
Neville nodded and adopted a supercilious air. "Miss Weasley, while
it may amuse your classmates to flaunt your love affairs and air your
family's dirty laundry in the hallowed halls of Hogwarts, <em class="calibre9">I</em>
am singularly unimpressed. To add to this ridiculous display, you
have tormented a defenceless animal and … ruined my robes. I will
see you in my office for detention, tomorrow. I am sure I can find
something for you to scrub, given your penchant for splashing water
about as if we were at a water park."</p><p class="calibre8">"He made Snape's
detentions sound like a friendly afternoon tea," Dean added. Harry,
who had been subject to more of Snape's detentions than he cared to
remember, doubted that very much.</p><p class="calibre8">"What on earth did
this Howler say?" Harry enquired, peering up the staircase, willing
Ginny to calm herself, change her mind and come down.</p><p class="calibre8">"First of all, Ron
very loudly asked Ginny if she was quite sane," Neville began.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then he
questioned her hearing, I think," Dean broke in.</p><p class="calibre8">"And her
brainpower," added Gilbert who had sidled up to the group of older
students.</p><p class="calibre8">"He indicated
dismemberment unless she came to her senses," Seamus called out
gleefully. Harry turned to him and realised that everyone in the
common room had fallen silent and all were watching the action at the
foot of the girls' staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's possible
he indicated he'd disown her if she messed you about," Dean added
helpfully. Harry grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stupid git,"
Harry muttered, turning his back on the rest of the common room.</p><p class="calibre8">"It arrived in the
Entrance Hall just as we were all going in to eat," Gilbert piped
up helpfully. "I've never seen one of those before. It <em class="calibre9">yelled</em>
at her!" Harry frowned at Gilbert's exuberance.</p><p class="calibre8">"She was very
embarrassed," Hermione said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I need to speak
to her," Harry said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Apparently,"
Hermione said shortly, "I am a poor messenger and she wants to know
why you don't have the bollocks to show up yourself." Harry
groaned in frustration.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't go up
there, is she insane?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I HEARD THAT,
POTTER!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What the-"
Harry stopped abruptly as he saw the fleshy end of an Extendable Ear
resting on the bottom step. He grinned evilly and picked it up,
careful not to touch the steps. He was just about to speak directly
into it when the other end flew down towards him, slapping him on the
face as it rolled itself back up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, that's much
better," Hermione said approvingly, "definitely much easier to
deal with than a tangled mess of string. Ron said he was going to
look at that. Did you know Ron got one tangled around a couple of
Chocolate Frogs once, and by the time he got them loose they were
just so annoyed they jumped away before-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,"
Harry said, without a great deal of patience, "I don't much care
about the innovations of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes right now. In
fact I could cheerfully strangle the lot of them!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Harry, you
don't mean that-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes I do!"
Harry exclaimed. "Have you <em class="calibre9">heard</em> George's poetry?"
Hermione just raised an eyebrow at him and Harry sighed. "All
right, I don't mean it … but I am running out of ideas here. To
think … I assumed I could come back and just talk to Ginny and yet
Ron, the git, has to go and mess it all up and put her in a really
foul mood!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, if you are
that desperate that you absolutely <em class="calibre9">have</em> to do this now-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Hermione,"
Harry interrupted, pacing back and forth at the foot of the stairs
and squeezing the Extendable Ear. "I absolutely have to do this
now. Why won't she come down? <em class="calibre9">I</em> didn't send her a Howler."</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay then, maybe
you just have to get up there-".</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, why don't
you just go up and get her?" Gilbert interrupted, peering around
Harry and up the stairwell.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't," Harry
said shortly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you
mean?" Gilbert asked. "Don't you know which room she's in? I
can go figure it out for you!" And before Harry could stop him
Gilbert had ducked under his arm and darted up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">Perhaps it was
because he was smaller and lighter than Ron had been during their
fifth year, but Gilbert made it to the eighth step before the klaxon
wailed with an ear-splitting screech and the first year tumbled to
the floor at their feet as the steps slid together seamlessly. Seamus
let out a loud guffaw and Neville chuckled quietly as Gilbert sat up
and rubbed the back of his head gingerly.</p><p class="calibre8">"At least you
learned it before fifth year." Harry grinned at Gilbert and
extended a hand to help him up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why didn't you
tell me?" Gilbert asked plaintively.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know now,"
Harry said with a wry smile. "Okay, how am I going to get her down
here?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, does she
like to slide?" Gilbert asked. "Cause maybe she'd like to just
slide down and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Gilbert," Harry
interrupted, "you're not helping." He was startled as Ginny
suddenly shouted from upstairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"HARRY POTTER!"</p><p class="calibre8">"That doesn't
sound promising," Harry muttered to Neville and Hermione slapped
him on the arm. Harry glared at Hermione before calling up the
stairs. "IT WASN'T ME!"</p><p class="calibre8">"WHY NOT?" Ginny
yelled back. Harry raised his eyebrows at Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Looks like she
<em class="calibre9">wants</em> you to do the impossible, mate," Dean said, slapping
him on the back and moving off. "Good luck!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, thanks a
lot," Harry grumbled, glowering at his retreating back. A door
slammed upstairs. Harry ran a hand through his hair haphazardly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's angry at
Ron, not you," Hermione said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why is she
yelling at me then?" Harry demanded. "What did you tell Ron
anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I just said that
Brogan insinuated we were … you know …" Hermione gestured
between the two of them helplessly. "And that Ginny sort of wasn't
really talking to you …"</p><p class="calibre8">"This is getting
me nowhere!" Harry exclaimed. "I need a way to get to Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"Just leave it
till the morning," Neville said with a shrug.</p><p class="calibre8">"This can't
wait," Harry said quietly. Neville nodded and clapped Harry on the
shoulder before he disappeared up the stairs to their dormitory.
Harry turned to Hermione. "All right then. What should I do now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why are you
asking me?" she asked him indignantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's your
fault!" Harry hissed, aware that the occupants of the common room
were still listening in.</p><p class="calibre8">"It is not,"
Hermione retorted hotly. "If you hadn't been an utter <em class="calibre9">git</em>
none of this would have happened!" Harry didn't know what to say.
She was right it was all his fault. He turned and thumped his head
lightly on the wall in frustration.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay I've been
in bigger scrapes than this before," Harry said. Hermione snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" she
asked sarcastically. Harry ignored her.</p><p class="calibre8">"We got out of
those just fine, we can figure this one out," Harry insisted.</p><p class="calibre8">"We?" asked
Hermione sceptically. Harry arranged his features into the most
pathetic expression he could. Hermione sighed. "Well really …
face-to-face isn't the only method of communication."</p><p class="calibre8">"What does <em class="calibre9">that</em>
mean?"</p><p class="calibre8">Before Hermione
could answer, the portrait hole swung open and Professor Crockwell
bustled in, her hair spilling out of the old-fashioned night cap
perched on her head, her glasses askew on the tip of her nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's going
on?" she asked breathlessly, hurrying to a stop in front of Harry
and Hermione, still standing at the foot of the girl's dormitory
slide. "Miss Granger, did I hear the stair alarm go off?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm, well-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who was it?"
Professor Crockwell demanded sharply. She eyed Harry warily and he
attempted to look as innocent as possible. He saw Seamus push Gilbert
back into his seat in front of the fireplace.</p><p class="calibre8">"Minor
misunderstanding, accidentally touched the step," Harry said.
Professor Crockwell narrowed her eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think, Mr
Potter, if you cannot keep to the rules …" she pursed her lips
and straightened her spectacles. "Young man, you are Head Boy and
have been here long enough to know better. I think perhaps … a
detention tomorrow might help you remember."</p><p class="calibre8">"But-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It must be time
for bed, all of you," the professor said. Harry stared at her, she
was normally so mild-mannered and ineffectual. He shook his head
wearily as she turned around primly and began hurrying everyone to
bed. He could almost feel everyone glaring at him. Professor
Crockwell turned back to Harry. "Given that Professor Fiesche is
already supervising a detention tomorrow I shall inform him that you
will be joining in." Harry groaned inwardly as she turned on her
heel and left, barking at a group of first years on her way out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, now we know
not to disturb <em class="calibre9">her</em> beauty sleep," Seamus muttered as he and
Dean approached the stairs to the boys' dormitory. Harry followed
them up, threw himself grumpily on his bed and kicked off his shoes.
There were two satisfying thuds as they hit the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Any luck, mate?"
Neville asked him from his seat on his own bed. He was surrounded by
parchment, quills, several bottles of ink and a rather odd collection
of rose bushes. They were lopsided and a number of brightly coloured
purple blooms littered the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"No luck,"
sighed Harry moodily. "Crockwell came and ordered us all to bed.
It'll probably have to wait till morning after all. At least she
knew I was trying … right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … yeah …"
Dean said slowly before trailing off. "But will she think you tried
hard enough?" Harry groaned and cursed violently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I need to talk to
her," he mumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione have any
ideas?" Neville inquired as he reached for one of the rose bushes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not really …
Neville, what <em class="calibre9">are</em> you doing?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Luna likes that
Muggle poetry we've been studying," Neville admitted sheepishly.
"So I sometimes pick one to send to her."</p><p class="calibre8">"Send her?"
Seamus wrinkled his nose at Neville. "Don't you see her all the
time? Why would you send her a poem?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't see her
late at night when she's in Ravenclaw Tower and I'm in Gryffindor
Tower." Neville shrugged as he pulled one of the rose bushes
towards him.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, you're …
sending her an owl?" Harry asked as Neville concentrated hard
waving his wand above the rose bush intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Neville
paused, "I can usually convince one of the owls from the Owlery to
fly up here. One of the Barn owls'll be here soon."</p><p class="calibre8">"So what are you
doing with the rose bush?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm …"
Neville blushed slightly. "Well, I've been working on getting a
blue rose. Mostly purple these days but I got a black one once. No
idea how <em class="calibre9">that</em> happened. This poem's about roses and she's
a Ravenclaw so …"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry watched as
Neville waved his wand in an intricate pattern and a rosebud cycled
quickly through several colours of the rainbow and settled on a
bright, emerald green. Donald Smythe, the boy in Ron's old bed,
snickered and Neville glowered at him before sighing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well at least it
matches your eyes," Neville said ruefully to Harry. "Not sure I
want my girlfriend reminded of <em class="calibre9">your</em> eyes when reading <em class="calibre9">my</em>
letter." Neville waved the wand over a second bush and produced a
lovely red rose which he scowled at.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … at least
it's a Gryffindor colour … she can think of you," Donald
suggested hopefully. Neville nodded, looking resigned and cut the
rose, wrapping it carefully in the parchment he'd been writing on.
He eyed the green rose with distaste.</p><p class="calibre8">"What am I going
to do with this one?" he complained. "Know any girls who want a
<em class="calibre9">green</em> rose? What a stupid colour."</p><p class="calibre8">"Audrey would
think it was an insult," Seamus sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only want to know
about one girl," Harry grumbled, "and she is <em class="calibre9">not</em> in a good
mood."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … she'd
probably like a rose that is the same colour as your eyes," Dean
said slyly. He winked, "Could put her in a better mood."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, but how am I
supposed to give it to her?" Harry asked listlessly. "When I see
Ron …" He trailed off grumpily, cursing his best mate who had
clearly annoyed his sister beyond reason. Further thought was
interrupted when a large, brown barn owl swooped in through the open
window, followed closely by a white blur that flapped ungracefully
around the room before alighting on the end of Harry's bed.</p><p class="calibre8">Liberty fluffed out
her feathers before tucking her wings close to her body and blinking
slowly at Harry. She hopped towards her owner slowly. To Harry it
seemed almost tentative and he extended an arm to her</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey girl,"
Harry murmured. "I haven't got any owl treats." Liberty hopped
onto his arm and up to his shoulder, nuzzling Harry's cheek before
taking off and fluttering madly over to Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey Libby,"
Neville said, producing an owl treat. Liberty seemed perfectly at
ease with Neville and pecked his ear affectionately before fluttering
back over to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"How'd she know
you'd have one?" Harry asked, smoothing Liberty's feathers as
she sat perched on his forearm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, she comes in
sometimes on the weekends," Neville said absently as he tied his
red rose to the parchment scroll and beckoned to the barn owl.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why only on the
weekends?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I guess she
spends most of the week with Ginny or at the Burrow," Neville
replied as he finished tying his missive to the leg of the barn owl.
Harry watched the powerful brown bird as it launched itself from the
dormitory window and into the night.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry realised he
almost never spent the weekend at Hogwarts and he paid virtually no
attention to what Liberty was doing. He knew Ginny often used her to
send letters but he never wrote to anyone and hadn't been to the
Owlery all year. All the correspondence he'd been attempting to
sort out for the Children's Home had been delivered by stuck-up
Ministry owls and he hadn't sent any of it back yet because he
hadn't found any staff.</p><p class="calibre8">Hedwig had been a
regular sight in Gryffindor Tower and Harry had kept bags of owl
treats for her in his bedside table but he hadn't bought any for
Liberty since he'd been at Hogwarts. Harry stroked the owl
thoughtfully. If he'd ignored Hedwig like this she wouldn't have
spoken to him until Christmas, but Liberty had no such issues. Harry
watched her as she jumped on his bed, her wings fluttering, before
perching on his leg precariously. Hedwig would have been appalled,
Harry decided with a slight smile. Hedwig had been a very dignified
owl but Liberty definitely had a more forgiving nature and a
mischievous air.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly, how
hard is it to make a rose go blue?" Neville muttered as he gathered
up his parchment and quills and dropped them into his trunk. Harry
looked up to find Neville glaring at the green rose which he had cut
before tidying the rose bushes away into one corner of the room. At
that moment Liberty hooted softly and stuck out her leg.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, you're
brilliant!" Harry exclaimed and began to rummage in his trunk for a
piece of string. He sat up clutching a ball of rough, brown twine to
find Neville smiling at him and holding out a length of red ribbon.</p><p class="calibre8">"It'll look
better," was all Neville said as Harry took the ribbon gratefully
and tied the green rose to Liberty's leg. Liberty spread her wings
and soared gracefully out of the window. Harry and Neville leaned out
of the window but it was fruitless because the white owl was soon
lost to sight around the curve of the Tower.</p><p class="calibre8">"Think it'll
work?" Neville asked Harry pensively.</p><p class="calibre8">"No idea," Harry
confessed. "I've never sent a girl flowers before. Do you think
she'll like it? Oh no, I didn't write a note! Do you think she'll
know it's from me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I think so,"
Neville smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"What if she's
so mad she refuses to let Liberty in?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No worries there
mate." Neville indicated Liberty swooping back to their window, her
leg now free of the rose. They backed up to let her alight on the
window sill. She hooted softly but carried no note.</p><p class="calibre8">"What does that
mean?" Harry asked in frustration. "She didn't send a note
back?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Give her the
night to think about it," Neville said softly, closing the window
and turning to his bed. Harry stuck his arm out for Liberty who eyed
him carefully before hopping onto Harry's forearm and up to his
shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">Liberty hooted
softly and hopped up and down on his shoulder merrily, nearly falling
off. The owl grabbed at his shoulder and Harry hissed in pain,
twisting away as the talons dragged across his scar tissue. Agitated,
Liberty fluttered up onto the top of his four-poster.</p><p class="calibre8">Liberty gazed at
Harry for a moment before giving a soft hoot and tucking her head
under her wing. Harry climbed into bed thoughtfully and spent a
fitful night dreaming of Ginny screaming at him from a Howler while
Ron laughed maniacally.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry dragged
himself down to the Great Hall for breakfast feeling very
out-of-sorts. He'd had a dreadful night's sleep, his clothes felt
like hot knives as they dragged across his shoulder where Liberty had
irritated the scar tissue and he didn't know what to do about
Ginny. He sat gloomily at the Gryffindor table and reached absently
for the bacon. Students drifted into the Hall as Harry ate breakfast,
the toast tasted like sawdust and the pumpkin juice slipped down his
throat without flavour. He was jolted from his reverie when Professor
Fiesche swept up to him and swished his elegant green robes
impatiently. Harry looked up at the professor.</p><p class="calibre8">"I understand that
you will be joining Miss Weasley in detention this morning?" the
man sniffed. Harry nodded mutely, afraid that if he opened his mouth
he'd laugh himself silly at the way the man's cat was perched on
his head, its tail flicking idly above his left shoulder. "If Miss
Weasley bothers to show up you will both report to Professor Slughorn
directly after breakfast. I understand he has some cleaning for you."
The man sneered in a passable impression of Snape as he swept away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Every time I see
that man I want to pull his cat's tail," Seamus said as he sat
heavily in the seat next to Harry and reached for the toast.</p><p class="calibre8">"What kind of daft
idiot wears a cat as a hat anyway?" Dean added.</p><p class="calibre8">"Does anyone know
why he does it?" Harry asked as he stabbed at his scrambled eggs
viciously. Seamus shook his head vigorously.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd think,"
Dean said, "that an Auror would have very little success at all the
dark wizard fighting with a cat sitting on his head."</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe it's his
secret weapon," said Neville, who had joined them. "It's a
secret, crime-fighting cat with super, magical powers." Dean
sniggered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it's
positively awful," Hermione said as she sat down opposite Harry.
"That poor cat … I mean would you like it if you had to live on
someone's head all the time?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You should do
something about that, Hermione," Seamus said seriously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think
other students might help?" Hermione asked him. Seamus nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes," Dean
said airily. "They'd be glad to."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, then you
can help me," Hermione said with a smug smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no ... no …
got NEWTS you see," Dean said. "Terribly important you know."
Hermione rolled her eyes at them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ordinarily I
would care about the cat but I'm much too busy preparing, um …
well I have something I'm doing anyway," Hermione said. Harry
looked up and eyed her carefully. Her face was a little flushed and
she was eating her breakfast with more care than was really warranted
for a slice of toast and marmalade.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you up
to Hermione?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure," answered
Harry sarcastically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not up to
anything illegal," Neville said under his breath. Seamus snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Or anything that
involves fun," Dean added. Hermione glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know how to
have fun," she said defensively. Dean grinned at her and raised an
eyebrow suggestively.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't hit
on her," Seamus said giving Dean a shove. "Ron would have your
guts for garters." Hermione turned her glare on Seamus who grinned
back at her, unabashed. Dean rolled his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wasn't
hitting on her-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Practicing then?"
Neville asked slyly. "Who's your next conquest? That tall blonde
in Ravenclaw … what's her name … Pamela?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shirley,"
answered Seamus without missing a beat. "He is totally going after
Shirley Templeton."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who calls their
kid Shirley <em class="calibre9">Temple</em>ton?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Mr and Mrs
Templeton?"</p><p class="calibre8">As his friends
bantered back and forth Harry tried to pay attention, but he kept
waiting for Ginny, his eyes on the doors to the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"She wasn't
there when I got up," Hermione supplied quietly. Harry turned to
her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who?" he asked
casually, taking a sip of his juice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny's down at
the Quidditch pitch," Neville said. "Saw her leaving in her
practice gear when I came down this morning. She's probably trying
to get practice in before this detention."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, breakfast
is nearly over," Hermione said crisply. "She'll miss breakfast
if she's not careful. Honestly, Quidditch is hardly more important
than breakfast. She hasn't been eating properly at all and she's
going to make herself sick if she keeps this up."</p><p class="calibre8">"Quidditch is
really important to her," Harry said defensively. "It's what
she wants to do for a career."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just a
game-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" Dean
interrupted. "It is not just a game! That's like saying football
is just a game."</p><p class="calibre8">"And what do you
think, Harry?" Seamus asked. "About Ginny having a career?"
Harry just stared at Seamus in confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's a
great career," he said slowly. "Why does it matter what I think
about Ginny having a career? I mean they give you career advice for a
reason, don't they? You have to plan for your future and all that.
Not that I gave that much thought at the time." He finished wryly
and Neville laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, but if
Ginny's off havin' a career, who's going to look after you?"
Seamus winked suggestively.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can look after
myself," said Harry, ignoring the innuendo.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, there are
things you can't do for yourself." Seamus grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I can get my
House Elf to look after me then," Harry said sarcastically, rolling
his eyes. Hermione looked at him reproachfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I don't
mean like <em class="calibre9">that</em>." Seamus leered suggestively. Harry launched
a piece of toast at his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly,"
Harry said, "leaving your dirty thoughts alone, I think it's
great that Ginny's thinking about her future and planning ahead and
all that. I know it's got its risks but she's got a real chance
and she should take it. She has my full support."</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, Harry,"
Hermione began tentatively. Harry turned to her and she continued in
a rush. "Did you say that to Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Say what?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That Quidditch
was great because she was planning for her future," Hermione
answered, playing idly with her fork.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think …
maybe … that she um …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Spit it out,
Hermione," Harry said wearily, tired of the games and never knowing
what it was he'd done wrong.</p><p class="calibre8">"She might have
thought, on top of everything Brogan insinuated …" Hermione
trailed off. Harry just looked at her. He tried to follow her train
of thought, trying to think what he'd said; and what Ginny might
have thought he'd meant.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had pulled
away from her physically and he knew that. Fixing it had seemed easy
enough, but if he'd made some other stupid mistake … Harry did
think it was brilliant that Ginny wanted to be a Quidditch player.
While he certainly didn't want the fame and all that came with it
Ginny would love it.</p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't that she
was an attention seeker but she did enjoy people noticing her. Harry
supposed it came down to being the youngest in a large family and
wanting to be noticed from something she could do rather than by
virtue of being the girl. She certainly knew what to do with
attention and she did enjoy it but, like Harry, she'd rather get it
for something she'd achieved than by something that had simply
happened to her.</p><p class="calibre8">In their future he
saw her as a Quidditch player and he saw himself getting all the
perks and benefits of Quidditch without having to be on the pitch and
in the papers. He could see them practicing together at their house.
It would be on a pitch like the one at the Burrow, only with real
hoops. It would be a place where he and Ron would convince Ginny and
George to play two-a-side Quidditch. Where he and Charlie would
challenge each other to catch the Snitch first and where he and Ginny
would teach their children to fly. He saw himself watching Quidditch
games with Ron and travelling Europe, seeing the sights and watching
Ginny play Quidditch while Hermione read a book.</p><p class="calibre8">Wasn't this what
he'd defeated Voldemort for? The chance to be whatever they wanted?
The opportunity to set themselves up with a future. The chance to see
the world, to follow their dreams. How could he have said anything
wrong by saying Ginny should pursue her dreams?</p><p class="calibre8">"What did she
think, Hermione?" Harry sighed wearily. "She has a problem with
me saying she should follow her dreams and plan for her future?"</p><p class="calibre8">"If it sounded
like that, yes," Hermione said cryptically. Harry narrowed his eyes
at her. Hermione sighed. "If it sounded like you were expecting her
to go off and plan her own life … without you."</p><p class="calibre8">"So because I
encourage her to plan her own life and future she assumes I want her
to plan it without me?" Harry felt like he was swimming in an
endless sea without a life raft and his arms were getting tired. He
was bound to sink beneath the surface any minute.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's what it
probably sounded like." Hermione shrugged. Harry groaned and
thumped his head lightly on the table, making the plates and goblets
rattle ominously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just brilliant,"
he muttered. Scowling, Harry collected some toast in a napkin just
before the plates vanished from the tables in the Great Hall and
stood up. He had absolutely no idea how to fix things but he figured
a breakfast peace offering was a good start.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry almost made it
to the great oak doors that led outside before Professor Slughorn
collared him only inches from his goal.</p><p class="calibre8">"I understand you
will be joining me today, m'boy?" the professor said jovially. He
lowered his voice and winked exaggeratedly at Harry. "You <em class="calibre9">and</em>
Miss Weasley as I understand it? Professor Fiesche mentioned he was
ah … too busy, one might say, to supervise. I thought to myself
that not only is it an absolute travesty that <em class="calibre9">you</em> are expected
to serve a detention, but you might like some, er … time alone."
Professor Slughorn gazed at Harry expectantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, um, thanks,
professor," Harry managed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I really don't
think these new professors know what's what, you know," Slughorn
continued as he grasped Harry's right arm and led him down to the
dungeons. "I volunteered at once to supervise of course. You need
people around you that understand you, m'boy. People who don't
expect you to do the same sort of drudgery as the rest of us mere
mortals."</p><p class="calibre8">They had arrived at
the dungeons and the packet of toast in Harry's hand was getting a
little soggy. He noticed with a start that Ginny was leaning against
the wall outside Slughorn's classroom. She was still dressed in her
Quidditch practice robes and her windswept hair curled around her
face where it had escaped the plait it was tied into. The cold air
had given her cheeks a rosy glow but under the colour on her cheeks
her eyes were a little sunken and she looked rather pale.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny had her eyes
closed and her head was resting on the wall behind her, exposing her
throat and Harry had to fight an almost overwhelming urge lean down
and suck on it and feel her pulse beat in his mouth. Her eyes snapped
open and she jerked her head forward suddenly, staring directly at
Harry before she looked away, the red heat of embarrassment creeping
up her neck. Harry gazed at her while Slughorn unlocked the door to
his classroom. Ginny looked fixedly at the floor and scurried into
the classroom as soon as the door was open far enough for her to
squeeze through.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, here we
are," Slughorn was saying. Harry listened with half an ear, his
eyes still on Ginny and the toast in his hand leaving trails of
slippery butter on his fingers as it soaked through the napkin. Ginny
had ducked her head forward, as if she could hide, but with her hair
tied back, there was no way for her to cover her face, and she only
succeeded in looking more alluring to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">Slughorn kept
chattering something about heroes and suitable treatment but Harry
paid him no attention. He was focused on Ginny and the way she
shifted from one foot to the other and pulled on the end of her
plait. Harry could see the tension in her neck and the way she
stiffened when he leaned closer to her. When Slughorn said something
vaguely stirring about gratitude and the love people had for Harry,
Ginny's eyes met his briefly before she turned away. A searing
blush crept up the back of her neck and Harry smiled as the tips of
her ears went crimson like Ron's did when he was embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre8">Oh, she knew he was
watching her, Harry was sure of that.</p><p class="calibre8">He smiled and leaned
casually against one of the desks. It was the weekend and he was
dressed in Muggle attire, something which he knew Ginny found very
attractive. She'd once confessed that she thought robes left a
little too much to the imagination and he'd let her buy him more
than one outfit before they had returned to Hogwarts. Ginny appeared
to keep her attention on Slughorn but Harry noticed the way her hands
still fluttered nervously with the ends of her plait and the way her
eyes strayed to where his feet stuck out into the aisle between the
desks, one hooked over the top of the other.</p><p class="calibre8">He took the moment
to admire the way her practice robes hung on her slim frame, her tiny
feet encased in the boots that went with the Quidditch uniform and
the warm jersey underneath, that clung to her curves enticingly. A
Gryffindor scarf was hanging out of her pocket, the end trailing on
the floor. Ginny got flustered when she tried to shove her hands in
her pocket and succeeded only in pulling the scarf out. She bent to
retrieve it and when she stood up she had shifted a little so that he
could see her profile and he watched avidly as her chest rose and
fell shallowly. His mind drifted to another time and another place
when he'd felt those curves under his hands and her hands had
trailed fire down his back as her legs curled around his. As he
watched her he wondered dimly if she had deliberately turned the
tables on him and was now trying to get his attention the way he had
been trying to get hers.</p><p class="calibre8">If she was, it was
working.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, we just need
to … um," Ginny said, sounding a little breathless, "clean this
erm, cauldron here?" Harry forced his mind back to the present,
leaving Ginny's warm, inviting curves and her soft skin in his
memories and valiantly trying to focus on the present.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, best to stay
a little while longer though," Slughorn added. "Check things
over, you understand. Make um … sure everything is …
accomplished." He winked exaggeratedly at Harry as he slipped out
the door, closing it with a soft click.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, not exactly
the detention I was expecting," Ginny muttered, rolling up her
sleeves and eyeing the cauldron distastefully. "Don't worry, I'll
do it. I'm the one who deserves the detention, stupid Ron, making
me lose my stupid temper, ruddy git."</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you know I
didn't do something to earn this detention?" Harry asked softly.
"Maybe that's my filthy cauldron you're cleaning there."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, come on, your
detention is totally fake," Ginny said, rolling her eyes
expressively as she stalked to a nearby shelf and began rummaging
about in the jars and bottles stored there. Harry took the
opportunity to quickly <em class="calibre9">Scourgify</em> the cauldron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fake?" Harry
asked, padding up behind her. "What on earth would make you say
that this is a fake detention?" Ginny huffed loudly and turned
around a jar of cleaning paste in her hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yours is a fake
detention because …" She stopped and turned pink. Harry suspected
it was the way he was standing mere inches from her, so close his
breath was making the tendrils of hair on her forehead dance.</p><p class="calibre8">"I cleaned the
cauldron," Harry said quietly, "and I brought you some
breakfast." He held up the greasy, squashed toast and smiled wryly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks," Ginny
said softly. She didn't take the toast and her eyes searched his
intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm really
sorry," Harry said, still clutching the toast between them like a
ridiculous lifeline.</p><p class="calibre8">"I got your rose."</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville made it,"
Harry confessed, squeezing the toast reflexively.</p><p class="calibre8">"It matched your
eyes."</p><p class="calibre8">"He didn't want
to give it to Luna." Harry ignored the butter slowly slipping
between his fingers as he dropped his eyes to her lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think you've
destroyed my breakfast," Ginny said with a giggle. Harry looked
down, startled, at the mangled lump of toast, still wrapped in a
butter-spotted napkin.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's me,"
sighed Harry, "destroyer of toast and relationships. I know I
messed up badly and if you don't want to go back to how we were
that's okay but I miss you and I want you back and I love you and-"
He heard the jar of cleaning paste thud onto a nearby desk and then
her hands were at his collar, pulling him down, her gaze fastened
unwaveringly on his mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry dropped the
toast as her lips met his and he hesitated only seconds before he
groaned and wound his arms around her waist. He pulled her close,
sliding one hand up to her neck and using the other to clutch her to
him. He shivered as her nimble fingers danced upwards, one hand
sliding up the right side of his neck to caress his scalp and the
other slipping slowly down to rest over his rapidly beating heart.</p><p class="calibre8">He hadn't noticed
when she'd done it, but Ginny had managed to entice his lips apart
and slip her tongue inside. Harry clutched her tighter when he felt
her tentatively stroke his tongue with her own. Up until then she had
been in control but this was like a switch had been flipped and Harry
pressed her back against the shelves, winding his hand into her hair
so that he could pull her head back and press his own tongue into her
mouth. When she moaned he thought he might lose all of his senses and
he tore his lips away from hers. Ginny whimpered and slid her right
hand up around his neck and across the scars there, to pull his head
back down to hers.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry forced himself
not to shrink from her touch. He was breathing shallowly, his eyes
closed, his mouth still tender. Ginny pressed a chaste kiss to his
swollen lips before she moved to press another to his jaw … and
another to the sensitive spot behind his ear. Harry kept completely
still as she moved lower to press feather light kisses on his neck,
lingering on the scars that snaked their way down under his collar.
His fingers tightened on her waist as she sucked gently on his neck
and he struggled to hold himself upright. He turned his head to find
her lips, desperately wanting to taste her again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," he
breathed against her lips before he kissed her slowly and he felt her
body press closer to his, her hand fisted his jumper as she clung to
him; Harry knew that they were holding each other up now. A tiny hand
trailed down to his back pocket and slipped inside, urging his hips
towards hers. He spun them around, backing Ginny into the Potions
bench and pressing against her urgently. Her leg curved around his as
he slid his hands under her robes and her jersey, fumbling to find
the soft, silky skin underneath. He buried his face in the sweet
curve where her shoulder met her neck, breathing in her scent and
kissing her collarbone softly before pulling back to look at her.</p><p class="calibre8">His breathing
matched hers, ragged and out of control, and her chest heaved as she
opened her eyes slowly to gaze at him. She was intoxicating,
breathtaking, spellbinding. He wanted to give in, to forget the rest
of the world, to forget their disagreements and make love to her.</p><p class="calibre8">Slowly he let go of
her waist and withdrew his fingers from her hair. He rested his
shaking hands on the bench on either side of her, unwilling to pull
his hips away from hers. He groaned as she shifted under him
restlessly and shook his head slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not here," he
whispered, bending to kiss her neck softly. "Not until we talk."</p><p class="calibre8">"So talk," Ginny
said. Harry looked up at her, meeting her gaze for the first time
since she'd started kissing him. He could tell that in this moment
she would give him whatever he wanted. He raised one hand and
caressed her cheek softly. She held his gaze resolutely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not here," he
repeated. "Not yet. I need … I need to apologise and I need to
tell you something." Ginny searched his face before looking away,
staring at the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"If … if you
don't want to any more, just tell me, Harry," she sighed. "Don't
drag things out."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't want to
what?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Be with me,"
Ginny whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am with you,"
Harry said, bending to press a kiss to her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where have you
been then?" Ginny asked, her voice harsh. Harry stilled, breathing
in the scent of her hair, his lips hovering above her skin. "If
you've been with me, why have I been all alone?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said. "I just … I need to …" He trailed off, looking
into her brown eyes. They were full of confusion and hurt.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, like I said,"
Ginny said, breaking the silence, "if you don't want me anymore,
if you don't want to <em class="calibre9">sleep</em> with me anymore, don't drag
this out or pretend. Just tell me-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" Harry
exclaimed. "No, I want to. What do you think I was just doing?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know,"
Ginny whispered. "You haven't kissed me like that … touched me
like that … for ages. You haven't let <em class="calibre9">me</em> touch you the way
I wanted to."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Harry
replied, slipping his arms around Ginny's waist. "I'm sorry, I
… let me explain." It sounded hollow and meaningless, even to
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I missed you so
much," Ginny said. "I was angry with you. It was <em class="calibre9">your</em>
fault Ron sent me a Howler. But then you touched me and kissed me and
I forgot how to be angry with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I just …"
Harry buried his face in her hair and whispered in her ear. "Please,
Ginny. Come with me so I can explain."</p><p class="calibre8">"What about
Slughorn? What about detention?" Ginny protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
being with the Head Boy counts as skipping detention," Harry said
cheekily.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Head Boy is
<em class="calibre9">in</em> detention," Ginny said, rolling her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, but my
detention was clearly … fake." Harry grinned at her. "Please,
come with me?"</p><p class="calibre8">She eyed him for a
moment before nodding jerkily as Harry released a breath he didn't
realise he was holding. He pulled away from her reluctantly and
straightened her robes, pressing a lingering kiss to her lips before
sliding one hand down her arm and grasping her fingers in his own. He
led her out of the Potions classroom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where are we
going?"</p><p class="calibre8">"My room," Harry
said. "I, um … I need your help with something. I should have
asked for it before now, but I didn't, because … well because I'm
an idiot and a stupid git."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is it about the
Children's Home?" Ginny asked as they climbed the staircases to
Gryffindor Tower. By an unspoken agreement they both avoided the
shortcut that would lead them past Gryffindor's room.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," answered
Harry, pretending to ignore a pair of fourth years who stared at them
so long they nearly fell off the steps as the staircases changed.
"Not unless you've got a brilliant idea for someone to run it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mrs Chumley,"
Ginny said promptly. Harry stopped right there on the fifth floor
landing and turned to her. He remembered the letter he'd read and
the fight Gilbert and Gerald had over giving up their magical home.
Their mother had put a positive spin on what was probably a terribly
dingy flat in a smog-ridden city and tried to make her jobless state
sound like a mere hiccup. Harry could never replace their little
cottage and he couldn't suddenly produce their father, but he could
give the family a home and their mother a job.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
<em class="calibre9">brilliant</em>!" Harry cried.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ginny
said and Harry leaned down to kiss her. She held a finger up to his
lips to stop him. "There are people watching." Harry shrugged as
he looked around the various people scattered on the Grand Staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let them," he
said simply. "Then they can see that I'm completely in love with
you." Harry wrapped his arms around Ginny, holding her carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" she
whispered, her eyes lowered to his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Harry
answered quietly, his hands caressing her back. "Don't you
believe me?" Ginny didn't answer him straight away and Harry
could feel his heart start beating erratically as it sank in his
chest. Eventually she lifted her gaze to his.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought maybe
you … changed your mind," she said tentatively. "After …"
Her face went pink as she trailed off. Harry shook his head
wordlessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You pulled away,"
Ginny said. She sounded incredibly bereft. "You didn't want me to
touch you." Harry buried his face in her hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry. I'm
so sorry," he murmured. Harry lifted his head and gazed at Ginny.
She was looking at him solemnly, biting her bottom lip.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know I'm not
very curvy," she blurted. Her face was going redder and she seemed
embarrassed to admit it. "I just-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's got
nothing to do with you!" Harry cut her off vehemently. "You're
wonderful. You look wonderful, you feel wonderful, you smell
wonderful, you taste wonderful." Ginny giggled nervously. Harry
brought one hand up to caress her cheek. "I … I was just scared.
I don't want to talk about it here. I need to show you something.
Come with me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay," Ginny
answered quietly. Harry clasped her hand again and led the way up the
stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">When they scrambled
through the portrait hole Harry pointedly ignored Neville and
Hermione as they pretended not to watch them from their table near
the entrance. He strode purposefully across the room and up the
stairs, Ginny's hand in his, an unnatural hush falling over the
room. An outbreak of giggling wafted up the stairs after them.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry opened the
door to his dorm and ushered Ginny inside. Liberty was still perched
atop his four-poster and she opened one eye as he shut the door with
a click. The owl flew down to Ginny and landed on her shoulder,
pecking her ear gently before fluttering over to Harry and settling
once more on his left shoulder. Harry hissed in pain and Liberty
squawked and flew back to the top of the bed. Harry clutched at his
shoulder, gritting his teeth.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's wrong
with your shoulder, Harry?" Ginny asked. Harry shook his head,
breathing slowly while the pain diminished.</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell you in a
minute," he said shortly, turning to Liberty and holding an arm
out. "Here, girl, I'm sorry. Come back down." Liberty eyed him
warily. Harry kept eye contact with Liberty but spoke to Ginny. "Can
you get some owl treats from Neville's drawer, there?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville's?"
Ginny wrinkled her nose as she ventured further into the room. Harry
gestured in the direction of Neville's bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"The one with all
the plants around it," he said. "He's got owl treats."</p><p class="calibre8">"Haven't you got
any?" Ginny asked as she rummaged through Neville's top drawer.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Harry said
shortly. Ginny didn't press him further but handed him a few owl
treats. Harry held them out to Liberty, who eventually flew down to
his outstretched arm. Harry stroked her softly for a moment before he
carried her to the window and opened it. "Go hunting, girl."
Liberty hopped onto the windowsill, stretched her wings and flew off.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry watched her
fly away, hoping he wasn't too late to build a relationship with
the little owl. He closed the window with a soft click and turned to
see that Ginny had taken off her Quidditch practice robes and thrown
them carelessly on his trunk. She was sitting on the edge of his bed
dressed in the jersey and a pair of old trousers that looked like
they might once have been Ron's. Her boots were in a heap on the
floor and her stockinged feet tapped an irregular rhythm on the
floor. She watched him silently, expectantly and Harry felt an
unmistakable urge to put off what he'd brought her up here to show
her. He crossed the room swiftly and rummaged in his nightstand for a
quill and some parchment before swiping a bottle of Neville's ink.
He sat gingerly on the bed next to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, will you help
me write a letter to Mrs Chumley?" he asked. Ginny raised an
eyebrow and nodded. They both knew that wasn't why they were there
but neither of them apparently had the courage to point it out.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry deliberated
over the letter, writing slowly and neatly. He told himself it was to
make a good impression but the irritated skin on his shoulder mocked
him, reminding him he was drawing out the inevitable. He finished the
letter, asking Mrs Chumley to be the resident carer at Grimmauld
Place and if she could start before Christmas.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know she's
not magical but … with Kreacher …" Harry trailed off as he
folded the letter and placed it on his nightstand. "If Liberty
doesn't come back I'll take that to the Owlery."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why don't you
have any owl treats for her?" Ginny asked suddenly. Harry shrugged
and turned away. They sat in silence for a few moments before Ginny
spoke. "What did you want to talk to me about?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked up at
her. She was sitting cross-legged at the end of his bed, leaning
against one of the posts and playing idly with a loose thread on his
counterpane. He didn't know how to begin. The long, awkward silence
stretched in front of them.</p><p class="calibre8">"How's Teddy?"
Ginny asked softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's great,"
Harry said, grateful to her for filling the awkward silence. "He
likes to copy your mum; change his hair and his eyes."</p><p class="calibre8">"You saw mum too?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I think
Andromeda sent for her," Harry said wryly. "She tried to feed me
cake and when I didn't eat it, she took me home and tried to feed
me treacle tart."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not like
you to pass up treacle tart," Ginny said with a smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well … I ate it
eventually," Harry confessed. Ginny laughed softly. Harry
continued. "Fleur and George weren't there. It is very weird to
sit at the table with your parents while they talk about the price of
strawberries."</p><p class="calibre8">"Strawberries
aren't in season."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, exactly,"
said Harry. "That's why they are so expensive and how come the
apples in storage will have to do for the pies tomorrow instead of
strawberry tarts." Ginny chuckled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't think
you'd be back until tomorrow." Ginny looked back at the stray
thread on the counterpane. "You're never back on Saturday."</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you
mean?"</p><p class="calibre8">"When you leave on
Friday," Ginny explained. "I know I'll have to amuse myself the
next day and … Hermione studies a lot and Luna is, um, trying to
seduce Neville."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is she … ah,
succeeding?" Harry asked, not sure he wanted to know the answer but
feeling strangely compelled to ask.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
so," Ginny said with a grin. "He's very attentive and I think
he genuinely likes her, but his heart isn't really in it. Luna
doesn't mind, she says he's an excellent kisser and Hannah will
really appreciate all the effort." Harry snorted. Ginny smoothed
the counterpane beneath her fingers.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not here
for you very much, am I?" Harry asked her.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not that
…" Ginny sighed and looked towards the window. "Remember
before? When every spare minute we had, and some we didn't, we used
to go somewhere … somewhere away from Ron and away from Hermione
and her study schedule? When all the spare time in the world was for
you and me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"And now every
spare minute I have is for someone else," Harry said dully.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, that's not
it," Ginny said with a hint of a smile. "It's just now that you
aren't stuck at Hogwarts and I am, I don't know– I sort of feel
trapped. Like I have to find something to do and Colin's gone and
Demelza's changed and Audrey Hamilton-Smythe is just using me to
get away from Seamus. I tried to hide from her the other day – in
the Library. Who hides from a Ravenclaw in the<em class="calibre9"> Library</em>?"
Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't like
her much?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, she irritates
me." Ginny scowled. "Not a single hair out of place, peaches and
cream smooth skin – I bet she uses WonderWitch products – and
perfectly straight teeth. Hermione told me she must be Muggleborn and
had ordothiticks."</p><p class="calibre8">"Orthodontics."</p><p class="calibre8">"So I asked
Felicia Smart," Ginny paused and giggled. "Can you imagine being
in Ravenclaw with that last name? I asked her what she thought and
she reckons Audrey has this big, old, metal thing full of wires that
she sticks in her mouth at night. Hermione said it's a lot less
painful to let Malfoy to hit you with a jinx and have Madam Pomfrey
fix it."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry I
haven't been here for you," Harry muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, you've
stuck me with Audrey, the mouth," Ginny grinned at him, letting him
know she didn't really mean it. "It's not just her orthoticks,
she talks! She never stops. So I always make plans so I have an
excuse or she would pin me down all afternoon."</p><p class="calibre8">"And what was
today's excuse?" Harry asked with a grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was planning to
spend the afternoon researching how to make a Howler."</p><p class="calibre8">"And now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"And now … well
I still really want to send Ron a Howler," Ginny scowled. "I bet
Bill helped him with that."</p><p class="calibre8">"I can help you if
you want," Harry offered.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's a git,"
Ginny burst out. "He doesn't know anything! He just decided from
miles away to send me a <em class="calibre9">Howler</em> of all things! I bet he hoped
it'd turn up in the Great Hall the way his did when you two flew
the car to school! Well, it wasn't far off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you know it
turned up in the Entrance Hall? Practically the whole school heard my
brother yelling at me not to break <em class="calibre9">your</em> heart. Did he stop to
think maybe it was <em class="calibre9">my</em> heart that was getting broken?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry winced. Ginny
ploughed on.</p><p class="calibre8">"So apparently I
am insane and deaf and <em class="calibre9">he</em> is going to disown <em class="calibre9">me</em> if I
don't fix it. Did he stop to think maybe <em class="calibre9">I</em> didn't think <em class="calibre9">I</em>
was the one who had anything to fix? Oh no, Ron's on <em class="calibre9">your</em>
side." Ginny's sarcasm level was rising. "I don't know why
I'm so surprised, he always has been. Honestly he would think
you're his brother and I am the evil witch trying to seduce you
away from his family and corrupt you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not all the
time," Harry ventured when she paused for a breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's none of
his business anyway," Ginny said, ignoring Harry. "It's
nobody's business and everybody thinks it <em class="calibre9">is</em> their business
and they keep sticking their noses in! Did you know that before we
left for Hogwarts Dad gave me a little talk about waiting for the
right time? And then Mum gave me tips on how to avoid pregnancy. I
mean, no offence, but she's not the most qualified witch to be
giving me that sort of advice!"Harry stifled a snort.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not
funny!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes it is,"
Harry argued. Ginny smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe a little,"
she allowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look," Harry
took a deep breath, "I've been really stupid and I owe you an
apology and an explanation." Ginny chewed her bottom lip and looked
at him solemnly. Harry didn't know where to start.</p><p class="calibre8">"If you're
regretting it-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" Harry
burst out. "I told you that." He ran a hand through his hair
wondering how to start.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't,"
Ginny said so softly he nearly missed it. She had turned away and
swung her legs off the side of the bed and was swinging them slowly.
Harry scrambled off the bed and knelt in front of her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," he said
urgently, "I don't regret being with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Was it too soon?"
Ginny asked. "Do you want to stop? It's a big change and maybe we
weren't ready. Well I'm pretty sure I was ready, but it's okay
if you weren't ready." Ginny was blushing and chewing on her
bottom lip as if trying to stop herself from blurting out anything
else. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was ready,"
he said. Without thinking about it he pulled his jumper over his
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought you
wanted to talk first?" Ginny asked, bemused, as he reached for the
bottom of his long sleeved sweatshirt. Harry said nothing and pulled
his shirt over his head.</p><p class="calibre8">He closed his eyes
kneeling on the cold stone floor in front of her. The cool air raised
goose bumps on his exposed skin. He heard Ginny gasp a little and
then delicate fingers reached out to his shoulder. He shivered, but
not from the cold.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't know
it was this bad," Ginny said softly, running her fingers gently
over his shoulder. "It's no wonder Liberty landing on your
shoulder wasn't exactly welcome. I thought you'd been using the
ointment on it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't reach
everywhere," Harry said softly, forcing himself to remain still as
her fingers trailed down his arm, tracing the red welts.</p><p class="calibre8">"You could have
asked me," Ginny said. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't want
you to see them."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't care
about your scars." Ginny's voice was so full of reproach that
Harry couldn't open his eyes and look at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't want
you to think it was your fault," Harry whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"How is a rabid
Quintaped my fault?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"No … they're
worse because …" Harry swallowed heavily. "I shouldn't have
played Seeker." He felt Ginny sink down onto the floor in front of
him. Small hands grasped his face, stroking gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, Harry …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't want
you to blame yourself," Harry explained desperately, opening his
eyes to look into hers. "It's not because I didn't want you
anymore, it's just that everyone told me I shouldn't play and I
know they were right; but I wanted you to have the best chance and
that's why I said it was great that you were practicing so hard.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione said you
probably thought I was trying to push you away because I told you
that planning for your future was a great idea. I just … I didn't
mean that <em class="calibre9">you</em> had to plan it because I didn't want to be a
part of it. I just know how much you want this and I know your mum
thinks it's not really important, but it is and I just want to be
supportive and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not
because I don't want you any more," Harry continued, ignoring her
interruption and grasping her hands in his, "because I do. In fact
I probably want you more than is reasonably healthy. Ron should be
sending <em class="calibre9">me</em> Howlers! He would if he knew what was going through
my head right now. But I couldn't ask you to help me with the
ointment because then you'd see and then you'd know and I didn't
want you to blame yourself-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I did anyway,"
Ginny interrupted forcefully. "You looked dreadful after the game
and Mum was chewing my ear off about it. I felt so guilty. Then when
you didn't want me to touch you and you wouldn't let me even see
your arm … I thought you blamed me."</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I didn't
blame you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Then I heard that
idiot McLaggen – how can a family have more than one git that
foul?" Ginny scowled.</p><p class="calibre8">"He was talking
out his arse," Harry grumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ginny
sighed. "Hermione tried to talk to me about it but …" She
trailed off and shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"With me being a
stupid git, what were you supposed to think?" Harry asked softly.
He reached up and cupped her cheek. "I should have trusted you. I'm
sorry."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Ginny
whispered. She stared at him for a moment, "me too."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry could stand it
no longer. He pulled her face towards him and pressed a kiss to her
lips. She responded immediately, wrapping her arms around his neck
and shuffling towards him so that she was practically sitting in his
lap. Her soft lips moved under his as he slid his fingers into her
hair. Ginny slid her arms down his back and Harry trailed soft, wet
kisses down her neck. One hand strayed to her belly and slid easily
under her jersey. As he touched Ginny's stomach it rumbled loudly
and Harry smiled into her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um … you
squashed my breakfast," Ginny said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wanna go to the
kitchens?" Harry asked her, his hand splayed across her stomach.
"And after that, can we go for a walk, if you like. I've got lots
of spare minutes today and I want to spend them all with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd like that,"
Ginny replied softly.</p>
