<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_15">*Chapter 14*: Chapter 14</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">14. Birthday</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry
stood outside Ginny's closed bedroom door. He was thinking over the
conversation they had earlier and trying desperately to figure out
which bit to apologise for. Giving up he knocked quietly on the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
in."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
pushed the door open slowly and stuck his head around the edge of the
door. Ginny was sitting at the window, resting her elbows on the
windowsill, her chin on her hands. There was a candle nearby and the
light reflected off her hair making it give off a reddish glow.
Though he could not see her face, he remained transfixed as he
studied her slender form and curves, highlighted by the soft glow of
the candle.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can come in, Harry," she said without turning around.</p><p class="calibre8">"How'd
you know it was me?" Harry slipped inside and closed the door with
a soft click.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
smell," she replied as she turned around. "You smell different to
the other boys here and Hermione doesn't knock."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,"
he paused before blurting, "I can smell you in Amortentia." He
felt rather foolish after he said that and Ginny tilted her head to
one side and studied him carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione
can smell Ron, you know. His hair," she replied conversationally.
He nodded dumbly. "I've never smelled it." She stood up and
stepped slowly towards him. "But you smell like wood, like
broomsticks and sunshine. What do I smell like?" She was standing
right in front of him now; her head tilted back, her neck exposed. He
could see the pulse beating in her neck and the rise and fall of her
chest as she stood otherwise motionless waiting for him to speak.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like
flowers," he whispered, afraid to break the spell she was weaving
over him. "Like flowers and like home." He crossed the short
distance between them slowly and reached out to take her hand in his.
Ginny looked down at their joined hands before looking up into his
eyes. Harry was mesmerised and lifted his other hand to caress her
cheek before trailing it down the back of her neck. His fingers felt
like they were on fire. Ginny shuddered as her eyes slid shut.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry," Harry whispered as his hand moved down her back. "I don't
want to fight."</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
not," murmured Ginny as she opened her eyes to look deep into his
own. Involuntarily the hand on Ginny's back pulled Ginny towards
him as he gazed down at her. He broke her gaze, his eyes flickering
down to her lips and when he looked back up he saw that her own eyes
were on his lips and he licked them nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't see you all afternoon," said Harry quietly. "I didn't
mean to argue with you. I never got used to the idea that people
think I'm a powerful wizard. I'm just Harry." Her eyes were
still on his lips as he spoke. Harry wasn't at all sure that she
meant to speak the next words aloud.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
you certainly have a power over me," Ginny whispered before she
leaned in and captured the lips she had been staring at hungrily, in
a searing kiss. Harry felt the worry that he'd been feeling all
afternoon lift from his shoulders. He lost himself in the kiss and
the feel of her lips on his. He was startled when Ginny's tongue
darted out and begged for entrance to his own mouth, she normally
waited for his request. Willingly he parted his lips and as Ginny's
tongue began playing with his own and he felt it run along his teeth
he was suddenly overwhelmed by her and the need that he felt coming
from deep inside him. It was powerful and scary and wonderful all at
the same time.</p><p class="calibre8">Somehow,
he didn't know how, Ginny had backed him into the door and as his
hands tangled in her hair he felt her body pressing into his as she
slowly caressed his tongue with her own. The involuntary reaction of
his body did nothing to slow her down. While Harry was acutely
embarrassed and tried to pull away it seemed to only make Ginny press
herself against him further. Harry gave himself up to her and when
Ginny made a little noise in the back of her throat he found himself
pressing <em class="calibre9">her</em>
against the door, something which she did not protest in the
slightest.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
had one arm around his neck and the other resting on his chest as
Harry's hands skimmed her hips and upper thighs and they continued
to kiss heatedly. Only a thumping on the other side of the door broke
through their ardor. Harry broke off the kiss, breathing raggedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
had enough time to make up! Get down into the kitchen for some hot
chocolate!" Ron called from the other side of the door. Ginny
giggled breathlessly and, now that the spell was broken, Harry
flushed with embarrassment and tried to pull away from Ginny
hurriedly. There was an evil gleam in her eye as she grabbed his
waist, pinning him to her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't mind," she said, looking up at him. "I think it's sort
of … sexy." Harry blushed harder but Ginny seemed unbearably
unflappable. Letting go of his waist Ginny placed two small hands on
his cheeks and forced him to look at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay, I love you," she whispered. Suddenly a sly grin stole over
her features. "And I thought you wanted to share everything with
me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's,
that's …" Harry paused, she was turning his words against him
now. He pulled her roughly against him and growled in her ear.
"That's sneaky Miss Weasley." She pulled back a little and
looked at him seriously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
mean it Harry, I don't mind. I'd be honoured to share that with
you," she lowered her voice to a whisper. "I'd love to share
that with you." Harry's heart skipped a beat as he watched her,
eyes sparkling, lips swollen and face just a little flushed from her
admission.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me
too," his voice was barely a whisper. "But not now, not yet."
She nodded, understanding him perfectly. Not now, not yet, but some
day. Harry kissed her again, softly, gently this time and she sighed
against his mouth. They didn't bother to straighten out or tidy
themselves up a bit before heading down for hot chocolate.</p><p class="calibre8">********************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
claimed Snape's body the next day and he and most of the Order
attended his burial next to Dumbledore on Hogwarts school grounds two
days later.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't know the true Severus Snape all this time. The man he showed
me, the one he showed most people isn't who he really was. He put
himself on the line, all these years, protecting me … I thought he
was trying to kill me," said Harry as he smiled wryly, a ripple of
quiet laughter went up. "This man was one of the bravest, most
loyal people I have known. He loved my mother, always until he died.
I thought about burying him near her, where he'd want to be, but I
figured my dad might have a few words with me about that and make my
eternity miserable. But he belongs here anyway, with Professor
Dumbledore who was the only one who really knew him, knew who he
was." Harry paused. The Giant Squid splashed lazily and Harry heard
Fang bark.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
one should be forgotten," Harry said quietly. Later when he stood
contemplating the headstone, he realised George had joined him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Getting
to be a habit of ours," said George, only half smiling. "What are
we going to put on the bottom of his?" Harry contemplated for a
moment before inscribing, at the bottom of the headstone,</p><p class="calibre7">'<em class="calibre9">Where dwell the brave at heart'</em></p><p class="calibre8">He
contemplated the words for a long time, knowing now they did not
refer only to Gryffindor House. He turned to find George several feet
away with a mischievous gleam in his eye. Hurrying over to
Dumbledore's tomb Harry watched as George added an epitaph to the
white monolith. In the bottom right hand corner he carved in small
neat lettering</p><p class="calibre7">'<em class="calibre9">Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!'</em></p><p class="calibre8">*************</p><p class="calibre8">The
rest of July was spent aimlessly. Sleeping late (rewarded by having
to degnome the garden if they did it too many mornings in a row),
going to see Teddy (who could almost roll over), visiting friends
(and being visited by lovestruck mates and their dotty girlfriends)
and playing Quidditch (with bewitched apples in the orchard). One
day, shortly before Harry's birthday, Dean and Luna and Neville and
Parvarti dropped by and Harry and Ginny were sitting in the garden
with them when Ron returned from Diagon Alley. He flopped down
ungracefully beside them.</p><p class="calibre8">"What're
we talking about today?" he asked. "Or are we snogging, today?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
we<em class="calibre9"> look</em>
like we're snogging, Ron?" demanded Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
at the minute but you two always look like you've just been
snogging."</p><p class="calibre8">"They
were snogging when we got here," piped up Dean helpfully. Ginny
narrowed her eyes at him. "Not that there is anything at all, in
the slightest wrong with that course of action at all, ever, in fact
Ginny should just really snog whoever, whenever she feels the er,
absolute need."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi,
what's with the whoever?" grumbled Harry. Ron shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
did not need that image, thanks, Dean."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
anytime, mate, anytime," Dean waved his hand airily before
muttering something that sounded like 'payback' under his breath.
Ron glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
was scarred for life, I'll have you know! I reacted perfectly
sanely if you understood my personal situation at the time!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What,
the pining over Hermione situation?" scoffed Ginny. Harry groaned
and flopped back on the grass. Neville looked puzzled.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
just made that worse," growled Ron, stabbing a finger in the air in
her general direction. Dean was watching Ginny and Ron
apprehensively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
stop it," groaned Harry. "We do not need to hear an entire
Weasley family kissing history<em class="calibre9"> again</em>!"
The others looked at Harry curiously as Ron and Ginny blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kissing
history?" Neville ventured timidly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah
yes, 'tis a time honoured sibling tradition. Catch your sister
snogging her boyfriend, express outrage and threaten to decapitate
said boyfriend. She returns in kind by mocking your lack of romantic
prowess in front of his best mate," Dean nodded sagely, trying to
conceal a grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
never threatened to decapitate you. Stop being so dramatic,"
retorted Ron. "You left pretty smartly as I recall," he finished
smugly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Must
we go over this?" asked Harry, disgruntled. "We do not need to
rehash old ground."</p><p class="calibre8">"Scared
they'll start on you next, Harry?" asked Parvati pointedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
did not save the world to be mocked about failed teenage romances,"
muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you're the one who described his first snog as 'wet'!"
laughed Ron. Parvati, Neville and Dean burst out laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
was crying!" said Harry exasperatedly and he closed his eyes to
shut out the sight of his friends falling about laughing. Luna looked
at him thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you that bad a kisser, Harry?" Harry opened one eye and glared at
her.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I am not!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Woeful
dancer though."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
a bunch, Parvati."</p><p class="calibre8">"Anytime."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think the Yule Ball was the worst night of my life," moaned Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
it wasn't you finest moment," Parvati muttered and Harry
shuddered. Parvati threw grass at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"First
dates, hey?" said Ron. "Good times, good times …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you mental? There was nothing good about our first dates, Ron!"
exclaimed Harry. Parvati threw more grass at him … and several
small twigs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mine
was all right," said Neville looking dreamily at the sky until
Ginny stepped on his foot. He started guiltily. Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
still have my feet, it's okay, although I'll have you know, I
could have gone with Harry," she pretended to swoon and then
giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
would have had a shocking time, it would have turned you off me for
good," said Harry. Parvati nodded emphatically and threw another
handful of twigs at his head. "I was fourteen and not into girls at
all." Neville, Dean and Ron were all overcome with a coughing fit
that sounded suspiciously like 'Cho'.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
look, Ginny's little hackles rise when you say Cho!" crowed Ron.
He began repeating it in a sing song voice while Ginny growled at
him. "Oooh I wonder if it works on Harry too … Michael … Dean
…" Harry had fallen about laughing helplessly and Ron stopped
because Ginny had narrowed her eyes at him in a menacing fashion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lavender
…" she hissed. Ron went pale. Dean and Neville joined Harry in
helpless laughter as Ron spluttered before going silent.</p><p class="calibre8">As
the playful banter wove back and forth under the glorious summer sky
Harry contemplated that in actual fact, this was exactly what he had
saved the world for.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">"What
will we do for your birthday, Harry?" asked Mrs Weasley at
breakfast the day before he turned eighteen. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
have a party!" crowed George from his seat next to Harry. "It's
been ages since we had a birthday party at The Burrow!"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a bit short notice, George dear," said Mrs Weasley, frowning.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
it's not!" said George.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
tomorrow, dear," said Mrs Weasley. "How would you let everyone
know – what if they're busy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ha!
This is Harry, mum! No one's going to be 'too busy'! I ask
you…" he trailed off as he began to turn out his pockets. He
obviously found what he was looking for amidst the Ton Tongue
Toffees, squashed packet of Canary Creams and what looked like six
pairs of Extendable Ears. "Here we are! No problem, you put the
Weasley twins on the case and you get results!" His mother froze as
George held his DA Galleon aloft. As he looked at it George seemed to
realise what he had said. He hurriedly shoved the mess on the table
back into his pockets and laid the coin on the table. Stabbing it
viciously with his wand he attempted to charm it to reveal details
for Harry's party. His hand was shaking and the spell didn't seem
to work and he only managed to turn the Galleon a very unbecoming
shade of green.</p><p class="calibre8">Suddenly
he threw the wand across the kitchen and it narrowly missed
Hermione's head as she came down for breakfast. Nobody moved except
George who dropped his head into his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
keep picking up stupid Fred's stupid wand," he cried. "I keep
forgetting I'm not twins anymore. I wore the 'F' jumper
yesterday and no one said anything. It's like he wasn't ever even
here …" Mrs Weasley sat down heavily and burst into tears. Ron,
who had been silent the whole exchange, went over to his mother and
wordlessly gathered her into an embrace. George sat staring at the DA
Galleon and Hermione moved over and put her hand on his.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
were you trying to charm it to say, George?" she asked softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry's
Birthday party, tomorrow," he said quietly. Hermione charmed the
Galleon to invite anyone who had one to come to The Burrow for
Harry's birthday the next day and then George broke down. Harry and
Hermione put their arms around him at the same time and just held him
as he cried.</p><p class="calibre8">It
was a quiet day at The Burrow. George, for the first time seemed
reluctant to remain in his room all day and he sat in the living room
answering anyone who tried to engage him in conversation with
monosyllables.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
does he sit down here like he wants company if he doesn't talk to
anyone?" wondered Harry as he, Ginny, Ron and Hermione ate lunch in
the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think he wants company really," said Hermione thoughtfully.
"He's been looking at that baby picture a lot, the one of him and
Fred." Harry jumped up.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
brilliant," he breathed. "I'll be back!" He hurried to the
fireplace and throwing some Floo powder in called, "Diagon Alley!"</p><p class="calibre8">When
Harry actually arrived in Diagon Alley he began to regret his hasty
decision to go there alone, without his Cloak. The place was packed
with witches and wizards and he suddenly realised that he'd likely
be recognized within minutes. Flattening his fringe over his scar and
keeping his head down he made it to the ice cream parlour. Ducking
inside he beckoned to Fortescue's nephew. He'd been kind to him
before third year, perhaps he'd remember him.</p><p class="calibre8">Oh
who was he kidding, he didn't need to be<em class="calibre9">
remembered</em>. Harry mentally rolled his
eyes at himself. He did manage to leave the ice cream parlour within
ten minutes, wearing a borrowed wide brimmed wizarding hat that was a
rather violent shade of red but it covered his scar and the brim hid
his face and he walked up the steps of Gringotts in it, unemcumbered.
Now that he was here, he had no way of finding Bill, he realised.
Stepping up to the nearest teller he explained that he wanted to see
Bill or Fleur Weasley but the goblins seemed singularly uninterested
in helping him. In exasperation he took the hat off and wiped his
brow. The protuberant eyes on the goblin in front of him looked as if
they would pop out of his head all together when he realised who
Harry was. After a twenty minute lecture on breaking into Gringotts
and stealing dragons Harry was delivered to Bill Weasley in a cart
that travelled more swiftly than was necessary.</p><p class="calibre8">Understanding
Harry's request Bill told Harry to warn his mother to expect him
and Fleur for dinner that night. Harry crammed the ridiculous hat
back on his head and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron to Floo
back home.</p><p class="calibre8">He
would not be drawn on where he had been or what he had been up to.
George studied him briefly when he poked his head into the living
room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you trying to blend in with that abominable hat?"George asked
bluntly. Harry grinned and shoved it on Hermione's head, pulling it
over her eyes while she was engrossed in a book.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
got a mischievous streak there, Potter," said George with
admiration in his voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
learned from the best, George. I learned mischief from the best."</p><p class="calibre8">George
and Harry shared a quiet grin while Hermione huffed at them and
pulled that hat off before discarding it in a heap on the floor. Mrs
Weasley turned out to be extremely pleased that Bill and Fleur would
be there for dinner and added several dishes to the massive amounts
of food she was turning out for Harry's birthday party. Bill and
Fleur arrived carrying a rather large parcel. It was covered in brown
paper and beyond saying it wasn't Harry's birthday present they
refused to say what it was.</p><p class="calibre8">When
they'd all eaten their fill and the dishes had been cleared away
Bill asked everyone to go into the living room. He followed them with
the large parcel. Taking a slightly smaller one from the pocket of
his cloak he handed it to George and the larger one to his parents.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
thought you would like these," he said simply and everyone in the
room knew he meant him and Harry, not him and Fleur. Slowly George
unwrapped the parcel in his hand as Mrs Weasley tore the paper off
the larger one. Inside was a framed photograph, taken at Bill and
Fleur's wedding. The twins in their dress robes stood laughing at
the camera. They watched as photo George poked his finger in photo
Fred's ear and Fred attempted to reciprocate before George affected
great injury to his missing ear. The two of them flung their arms
around each other's shoulders and waved at the camera.</p><p class="calibre8">A
lone tear dripped down George's cheek, splashing on the glass as he
watched the photo. Mrs Weasley reached out to touch the laughing
image of Fred solemnly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
the last one we had taken together," said George quietly. Bill
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
one's for you. The other one's for in here."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Bill, it's wonderful. Thank you," murmured Mrs Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was Harry's idea," said Bill. "He would have done it if not for
the fact the photos were at my place and his ridiculous and
conspicuous headwear."</p><p class="calibre8">"Even
without headwear he's ridiculous and conspicuous," said George.
Everyone started laughing and Mr Weasley hung the photograph in pride
of place on the living room wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
did you know, Harry?" asked Hermione. "How did you know that
would help?" Silently Harry made his way up the stairs and returned
a few moments later with a small photo frame that he handed to
Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,"
she said softly as she watched James and Lily Potter waving at the
camera from a snowy Hogsmeade street.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
awoke the next morning because of a pillow to the head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wake
up birthday boy!" yelled Ron several decibels louder than
necessary.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shuddup,"
Harry mumbled as he buried his head under his pillow. Ron jumped on
top of him then.</p><p class="calibre8">"Geddup!
Geddup! Geddup! You should have been down ages ago!" he yelled
bouncing up and down on top of Harry. Harry pulled his head out from
under the pillow and glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
how old are you, Ron?" he yawned. "Anyone would think it's<em class="calibre9">
your</em> birthday – or Christmas, the way
you're carrying on!" Ron jumped off the bed and hauled back the
covers, pulling on his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"All
right, All right, I'm coming!" Harry managed to pull on some
jeans and shove his feet into his trainers and was pulling a T-Shirt
over his head when Ron grabbed his arm, hauling him out of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
is <em class="calibre9">with </em>you,
Ron?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
your birthday! There is presents!" Harry simply shook his head.
Well of course there was presents, he was fairly used to there being
presents by now.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
eighteen, Ron, I think a little decorum might be in order?" he said
exasperatedly as Ron tried to pull him faster down the stairs. He
found himself going slower just to annoy Ron. "Oh wait, I get it,
someone's clearly bought me a big box from Honeydukes, haven't
they? And you can't wait to get into <em class="calibre9">that</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
no, no, no! Well I think there is a lot of chocolate and stuff there,
anyway I already opened the Bertie Botts, oh, er … oh just come
ON!" Ron finally succeeded in pulling Harry all the way into the
kitchen, whereupon Harry stopped dead.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hullo
Harry! Happy Birthday!" Hagrid had squeezed his great bulk into The
Burrow's kitchen and was carrying a rather large box.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid!"
called Harry cheerfully as he made his way across the kitchen (which
wasn't far considering Hagrid was so big he filled most of the
kitchen). "It's good to see you!" As he reached Hagrid the
large box was thrust at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Made
it meself," said Hagrid. "Grawp wanted to 'elp but, well, he's
jus' not very good with tha' cookin'."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Hagrid," said Harry, opening the box to reveal a lopsided birthday
cake. Putting it on the table next to a pile of gaily wrapped
presents he threw his arms around Hagrid and braced himself for the
reciprocation. As he regained his breath and tested his lung function
Harry realised Ron was gesturing wildly and whispering urgently to
Hagrid.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I dunno, Ron," said Hagrid. "It's supposed to be here. It were
supposed to get'ere tha same time as me, that bein' the signal
an' all."</p><p class="calibre8">"Stupid
Percy," muttered Ron. "Why did we trust him with it again?" Mrs
Weasley who was cooking at the stove gave Ron a sharp look.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy
Birthday, Harry dear," she said as she gave him a hug and a kiss on
the cheek. "Sit down, sit down, breakfast is nearly ready. Ron, go
and get everyone else. I don't know why everyone is so slow this
morning." As Ron dashed back off up the stairs Hagrid told Harry a
little about how Hogwarts was coming along.</p><p class="calibre8">"It'll
be in fine shape when you all come back an' all," he said. "Good
as new an' ev'rythin'." Mr Weasley came in through the back
door just then and George, Ginny, Hermione and Ron came thundering
down the stairs. Mrs Weasley hustled them all to seats and gave them
all heaping piles of breakfast. Harry noticed Mr Weasley pulled Mrs
Weasley aside and they were having a furious whispered conversation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
it's supposed to be here. I don't know why it isn't!"</p><p class="calibre8">"That
was the whole point of using Hermes!" Ginny and Ron kept glancing
up to look out the window and Hermione raised an eyebrow at Hagrid
who shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
is everything all right?" asked Harry. "You all seem a little
tense." Hagrid reached out and patted Harry on the shoulder,
knocking him off his chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
problems at all, here, have a present," said George hastily as he
hauled him back into his seat and shoved a box from the pile at him.
"That one's from me and F-Ron it's new stock for school."
Before he could open it the fireplace flared to life and Bill and
Fleur came tumbling out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy
Birthday Harry!" said Bill cheerfully. "Did you like your
present?" he was hurriedly shushed by the other occupants of the
room. Harry looked at them all with a great deal of suspicion.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
haven't opened any yet," he said pointedly. Bill looked confused.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
Hagrid's here," he said. Harry shook his head deciding they were
all completely mad. He opened the box in his hands. It was filled
with an assortment of Wheezes, not all of which were familiar.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
George, thanks, Ron!" he said. Hermione handed him another package
as George nodded absently and glanced out the window. Harry took the
parcel Hermione held out and peered out the window. "What're we
looking for George?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing,
nothing at all," said George hastily. "That's Hermione's.
It's a book." Harry rolled his eyes and tore the paper off. He
looked at it curiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,
I don't mean to be rude or anything, but why did you get me a book
on broom care when I haven't got a broom?" Hermione flushed a
deep shade of pink.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you know, you'll get one soon, won't you?" said Ron hurriedly
plucking another parcel off the pile and thrusting it at him. Harry
shook his head resignedly and looked at Ginny but she was engrossed
in some sort of silent conversation with her mother that he could not
decipher. Shrugging Harry opened the parcel to reveal some Chocolate
Frogs from Ginny when the fireplace flared again and Percy stepped
out. The room fell even quieter than it had been; which a feat was
considering they had all been sitting in tense silence as it was.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy!"
his mother hissed at him. "Where is Hermes?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
Errol showed up!" cried Percy. "It's like he knew you'd given
his job to another owl! He kept pecking me and I had a lot of trouble
sending Hermes off."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
is it coming?" demanded Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
about the other?" asked Hagrid.</p><p class="calibre8">"Any
minute now," hissed Percy, "ah, Harry, many happy returns." He
handed Harry a small package. Harry looked up as he pulled the paper
off the gift in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Percy," he said before he looked back down. He stared at the item
in his hands completely at a loss, his brows drawn in confusion
before he shook his head and put it on the table next to the book
from Hermione. Ginny reached over and picked it up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy,
why would you get owl treats for someone without an owl?" He knew
she didn't mean it but Ginny's words were like a knife twisting
in his gut and he didn't hear what excuse, if any, Percy gave her.
Ron looked sharply at his sister and Hagrid made a choking noise. Mrs
Weasley thrust another package into his hands and he thanked Bill and
Fleur gratefully for a nice, normal, unpuzzling gift of parchment and
quills.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
very interesting I know," apologised Bill. "But you know,
practical." He shrugged and looked pointedly out of the window.
Harry resolved to ignore their strange behaviour, there was
whispering now, and pulled the last of the packages towards him. Mr
and Mrs Weasley had given him a box of Honeydukes chocolate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
everyone," he said but they all ignored him as Hermione, now
standing by the window shrieked,</p><p class="calibre8">"Here
it comes!" Everyone scrambled to the window, except Harry who began
to eat his breakfast, firmly resolved to ignore the continuing odd
behaviour of his family.</p><p class="calibre8">He
didn't get very far as everyone suddenly dived out of the way as
two owls came soaring in with an absolutely enormous parcel that they
dropped right in his breakfast, spilling his pumpkin juice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy
Birthday Harry!" squealed Ginny, clapping her hands gleefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is your real present, mate!" crowed Ron gleefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
there was nothing wrong with the other presents," said Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Go
on! Open it!" urged Mrs Weasley. Harry was about to but he was
distracted by the owl that had arrived with Hermes. She wasn't a
particularly large owl but given that she was a Snowy Owl who bore a
strong resemblance to Hedwig and had commenced pecking his hand it
was not surprising that she caught Harry's attention.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy
Birthday, Harry," said Hagrid softly as he pulled a large cage out
from behind his chair. The owl hopped onto his arm and clawed her way
up to his shoulder, nipping him on the ear. Harry unearthed a piece
of bacon from underneath the enormous package and gave it to her.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
mine?" he whispered, looking up at Hagrid who nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
only 'bout a year old. Found a bloke who was inter rescuin' owls,
yeh see," Hagrid began. "Jus' over a year ago there were a
massive Snowy Owl slaughter. Reckon You-Know-Who was lookin' to get
Hedwig ." Hagrid stopped and sniffed. Harry blinked. "Anyway, the
babies are born in May and this bloke found a nest, the mother had
been killed and all the lil' babies didn' make it, 'cept o'
course this un. He took her 'ome an' hand raised her." Ginny
reached out to stroke the beautiful owl.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
that's so sad," she cried softly. Harry contemplated the bird,
orphaned by Voldemort, and could only agree with the next thing
Hagrid uttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"See
'n she's meant ter be yours, Harry," sniffed Hagrid. The owl
had climbed onto Ginny's arm and she had opened the bag of owl
treats (after throwing an apologetic look at Percy) and offered her
one. Harry leapt out of his chair and in spite of his earlier
remonstrations to Ron about acting their age he threw himself at
Hagrid as if he were eleven years old again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Hagrid," he murmured into Hagrid's shoulder (which he could only
just reach even though Hagrid was sitting down). Hagrid patted him on
the back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yer
welcome, Harry, yer welcome."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you knew, hey Perce?" said Ron as Harry surfaced from Hagrid's
embrace. Percy nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid
brought that owl along with the br-present and suggested they both
bring it," he explained. "That also caused some delay. Hermes, er
was a bit too, well, <em class="calibre9">friendly</em>
this morning." Percy blushed and Ron laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you going to call her, Harry?" asked Hermione. Harry watched as
Ginny stroked the owl's head and crooned softly to her. He wondered
what Ginny wanted to call her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
let <em class="calibre9">her</em> do
it!"exclaimed Ron as if he'd read Harry's mind. "She's the
one who named<em class="calibre9"> Pigwidgeon</em>!
I'm tellin' ya mate, don't let her name your kids without some
serious input!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But
if he lets her name the animals he can get significant naming rights
over the kids," interjected George. Harry just looked at them and
shook his head. He reached over and stroked the bird still perched on
Ginny's shoulder and the owl nipped his fingers affectionately.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
should we call her, Ginny?" he asked softly as the owl hopped over
to Harry and leaned over to investigate the cage next to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Liberty,"
said Ginny. Harry smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Perfect."
The two of them stood there petting the snowy owl and Ron made an
indistinct noise in his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you two have finished being domestic, do you think we could get to
the present opening?" he asked pointedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
from all of us," said Mr Weasley. "Go on, open it." Harry saw
the occupants of the kitchen watching him expectantly. He reached out
and began to peel off the paper. Ron gave a noise of disgust and tore
off a huge piece of the paper covering the parcel.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hurry
up, Harry!" he said exasperatedly. Harry laughed and together they
ripped into the parcel. When the contents were revealed Harry could
only stare in astonishment.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Gryffindor Captain needs the best broom there is."</p><p class="calibre8">"Even
Charlie agreed that's a Seeker's broom."</p><p class="calibre8">"See,
it comes with its own servicing kit."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
so shiny!"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a Firebolt Three!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Say
something Harry!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
… it's for me?" Harry looked up, his eyes wide. Ginny nodded
vigorously. "I … wow … thanks!" Harry breathed. Ron was
bouncing up and down, his own broomstick in his hands, his behavior
finally explained. Harry should have known only a broomstick could
get him acting the way he had been all morning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on, Harry! Let's go flying!" Harry looked expectantly at Ginny as
he picked the broom up but she shook her head as she handed him a
bacon sandwich.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
see you out there after I help clean up in here. Go with Ron, I'll
put Liberty's cage away."</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
flying with me later?" Ginny nodded and Harry kissed her on the
cheek hastily before tearing out the kitchen door after Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">He
spent the next hour with Ron, flying around The Burrow. They took it
in turns to ride the Firebolt Three. It was a magnificent broomstick
and responded like it was part of him. Then Ginny came out to fly and
he coaxed her into riding the broom with him. As she slid onto the
back of the new broomstick and clasped her arms around his waist he
took off and she shrieked as they rocketed towards the clouds. Harry
dipped back down and levelled off, flying
in circles around the trees in the orchard while Ginny drew lazy
circles on his stomach with her fingertips. He could feel her breath
on the back of his neck, her legs pressed up against him and that
made him very aware of the rise and fall of her chest as it pressed
against his back.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
started when he realised Ginny was pressing feather light kisses on
his neck and across his shoulders and that her hands had worked their
way under his T-Shirt. He flew around two more apple trees and then
nearly collided with a pear tree when the feel of her fingertips on
his skin made him shiver and lose concentration. He landed softly in
the shade of the pear tree and turned in her arms. Wordlessly he
wrapped his arms around her, the broomstick still in one hand and
began pressing soft kisses along her jaw before capturing her lips in
a slow and sensual kiss. He didn't stop when they heard Ron land
right next to them and ask if he could have a go on the Firebolt
Three if they were going to snog instead of fly. Harry simply held
the broomstick out in the vague direction of Ron's voice and when
it was liberated from his grasp, used his now free hand to run up and
down Ginny's back. They were interrupted by Liberty who landed
roughly on Harry's shoulder, causing him to yelp in pain.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
was that for, you silly bird?" he cried as he rubbed his shoulder,
Liberty having hopped to Ginny's arm when he yelped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call her silly!" reprimanded Ginny. "She's just a baby, aren't
you gorgeous girl?" As she began to coo at the owl and stroke her
feathers Harry just shook his head and wrapped his arms back around
Ginny's waist from behind, splaying his hands across her tummy.
Liberty suddenly took off and they watched her soar back to the house
where they noticed Hagrid was leaving. He called out to them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Got
ter be heading back now! Happy birthday Harry! I'll see you two
back at Hogwarts!" He waved cheerily as he flagged down the Knight
Bus at The Burrow's gate and Harry watched until the Bus took off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you having a good day, Harry?" asked Ginny softly as Harry rested
his chin on her shoulder, watching Liberty swoop around the trees in
the orchard.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I am," he replied. "But then, any day with you is a good day."</p><p class="calibre8">"Flatterer."</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I mean it," said Harry earnestly. "Being with you just makes me
feel good." George had come out to the orchard and they watched him
chase Ron around the trees, the new Firebolt easily eclipsing
George's broom and Liberty swooping between the two of them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Flying
feels pretty good too," murmured Ginny. "It feels so different
now. It's like the whole world feels free."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
because we are," said Harry, unable to resist pressing a kiss on
the soft skin just behind her ear. "Flying is wonderful, and I love
the broom. I can't believe it's mine … that'd you'd all get
it for me. It's amazing."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
should go get it back off Ron, have a real go at it. Go on," she
urged him. "Mum's not going to let you help with any chores today
anyway – go on, go fly." Harry spent the rest of the morning
flying. Liberty joined him occasionally before going off to hunt or
swoop on the garden Gnomes which seemed to endlessly fascinate her.</p><p class="calibre8">Feeling
mischievous Harry would fly past Hermione as she sat reading under
one of the trees, going so fast the pages in her book fluttered
uncontrollably and he would laugh gleefully as she got flustered and
told him off. But he kept doing it and she didn't stop him.</p><p class="calibre8">When
Ron and George were called to help set up tables for the party Harry
flew in circles around the lawn, doing his best to get in their way
and hanging upside down from his broom as he flew alongside giving
'helpful' tips on how to levitate the tables and where to put
them. Ron called him a silly git and that he'd put the tables
wherever he wanted but neither of them told Harry to stop, no matter
how many times he messed up their concentration. Harry would laugh
riotously as he shot away from the havoc he'd created.</p><p class="calibre8">Percy,
Bill, Fleur and Mr Weasley had gone to work after watching him fly
for a few minutes when he first went out but Mrs Weasley was in the
kitchen cooking up a storm. When he'd had his fun with Hermione and
finished with Ron and George, he flew up to the kitchen window and
hovered there until Mrs Weasley opened the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello
dear," she said, pushing the window open and the curtains aside.
"Are you having fun? Is it a good broomstick? The boys picked it
out; I don't know much about broomsticks you know." Harry grinned
at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
great Mrs Weasley! Thanks!" he said. "Did you know that you are
the second most beautiful woman here today? And the best cook in the
entire world?" Mrs Weasley shook her head at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
do you want, Harry?" she asked. Harry grinned at her some more.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you making treacle tart?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course I am! Now be off with you before you fall off and into my herb
garden!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
soared away, his laughter carrying on the air. He swooped and dived,
Liberty alongside him, and reflected that he'd not felt this free
and this<em class="calibre9"> happy</em>
in quite a long time. Spotting Ginny carrying what looked like
decorations out to the garden Harry soared over to her and hovered
only long enough to plant a kiss on her cheek before climbing up into
the sky and commencing another circuit of the orchard. He didn't
realise that far below him The Burrow's occupants were reveling in
Harry's mischief and fun as much as he was, for they had never seen
him so carefree and happy and no one was willing to change that no
matter how many pages he ruffled or tables he caused to crash to the
ground.</p><p class="calibre8">People
weren't due to start arriving for Harry's party until mid
afternoon. He'd been shooed from the kitchen by Ginny and Mrs
Weasley shortly after lunch and spent the first part of the afternoon
with Ron and Hermione down at the pond. The three of them had not
spent a lot of time together recently and as they splashed in the
pond, soaking up the summer sun Harry was suddenly overcome by the
realisation that things were about to change. He stopped throwing
water at Ron abruptly and waded over to sit on some rocks near the
bank.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong, mate?" asked Ron, following Harry as he hoisted himself onto
a smooth, flat rock near the water's edge. Harry pulled his knees
up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them and sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Things
are going to be all different," he explained. "Which is a good
thing for lots of reasons, but … well I guess I realised I'm
going to miss you … miss us." He looked at Ron sadly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
–"</p><p class="calibre8">"Never
mind," Harry said quickly. "It's silly of me. You'd think I
could get by for a few months without my best mate." Ron looked at
him thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll
still have Hermione."</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
a girl," Harry grimaced, and Ron laughed. "It's not the same."
Hermione managed to make her way over to them and Ron hauled her onto
the rock beside them. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her to
sit between his legs, her back resting against his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"George
needs me," he said as he leant his cheek on top of Hermione's
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I know."</p><p class="calibre8">"And
you'll have Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
a girl too."</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong with girls?" demanded Hermione sharply. Ron laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing,
Hermione," replied Harry. "It's just not the same." Hermione
leaned over and put her hand on his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know," she said. The three of them sat companionably in the sun for
a long time.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think I ever thought this time would come, you know," said
Harry, breaking the stillness. "Growing up, doing different things.
I don't know if it's because I didn't think I would get to grow
up or it just seemed too far away."</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
no one ever thinks they are going to grow up? Maybe it's like this
for everyone," mused Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you ever think of yourself as an adult?" asked Hermione suddenly.
"You know, with a job, married, maybe some kids?" Harry shook his
head. Ron surprised them both by nodding emphatically. Hermione
smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did you imagine, Ron?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Having
a daughter," he said, leaning back on his hands and tipping his
head back to sun his face. "Weasley women are rare but that would
make her so much more special. And she'd be smart, heaps smarter
than me, like her mum." He leaned forward and wrapped his arms
around Hermione then, placing a light kiss on her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
I always imagined having a son too," he continued, "one who plays
Quidditch. He's going to be brave and loyal. I reckon he'd be a
bit of a troublemaker though. I figure he'd get that from his Uncle
Harry." Ron winked at him and they both stifled laughter as
Hermione launched into a spiel about how she would not be at all
surprised if his own son got that entirely from him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
wouldn't need Harry's help to corrupt our son," she finished
exasperatedly. "I am sure you would be quite capable of doing that
on your own."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ours,
huh?" Ron asked softly and Hermione blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
she admitted shyly, "my imaginary children always had you as their
dad." Harry contemplated leaving them to it as he watched Ron
nuzzle the side of Hermione's neck when suddenly Hermione asked
Harry if he wanted kids.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
I do," Harry said after a moment. "I used to think I didn't
even have a future. I reckon I've got one now. Maybe I'll be an
Auror and get married and have some kids. If I had a son, I'd call
him James."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
do you reckon he'd look like then?" asked Ron idly as he twirled
a strand of Hermione's hair around his finger.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me,
I reckon," said Harry wistfully. "Only maybe he'd have brown
eyes like my dad … Everyone could tell <em class="calibre9">him</em>
he looks just like his father only with his mother's eyes … I
always thought, you know that you and me'd be Aurors together
though. Maybe that's why I can't imagine the next year without
you. I always thought we'd be together."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
the sort of thing you say to a girl mate," snorted Ron. Harry shook
his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not like that and you know it!" he protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
I know." They lapsed into silence again. Harry watched Ron as he
trailed his fingers up and down Hermione's arm and she shivered
before leaning into his touch.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny's
the only girl I trust you know," said Ron suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Huh?"</p><p class="calibre8">"With
your heart," said Ron as he averted his eyes to stare over the
pond. "No one else is good enough for you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
mum told me you all thought I was the only one good enough for
Ginny," Harry said softly, staring into the distance.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
true too," sighed Ron. "But you mean as much to me as she does.
And no one loves you like she does, you know. She's my baby sister
– don't tell her I said that – and she means the world to me.
But you do as well. Take care of each other, okay?" Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
will."</p><p class="calibre8">"It'll
be okay won't it?" asked Hermione suddenly. "We'll be okay
now?" Harry looked at her, sensing the worry behind her question
but it was Ron who answered her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
we'll be okay now. We've been through too much for it all to fall
apart now," he said with authority. "Look after my girls at
Hogwarts, Harry." Harry smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can count on it, Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">*******************</p><p class="calibre8">The
party was a great success, the garden filling up with young people in
only a short time and a pile of unexpected presents growing ever
higher on one of the tables. Lee and Angelina turned up together with
Katie Bell and cornered George. Harry found Katie and George a short
time later, behind a tree, looking very much involved. He left them
to it, a smile playing across his lips. Neville, Dean and Seamus
spent quite some time exclaiming over his new broomstick with Ron but
Lavender, Luna and the Patil twins spent more time with Liberty,
exclaiming over her. Most of the DA came and a few brought friends.
Alicia brought Oliver Wood and they appeared to be very much an item.
As he watched Ron and Hermione wandering around fingers entwined and
Luna apparently attached to Dean's hip he began to wonder where
Ginny was. Watching Parvati feed Neville some grapes just made him
nauseous but it also gave him a longing he knew meant he wanted to
see Ginny, be attached to her hip, hold her hand; maybe not so much
the grape eating but the involvement behind the tree thing was
looking mighty attractive.</p><p class="calibre8">He
still hadn't found her amongst the guests when he spotted Cho
heading towards him purposefully. He knew it was desperately obvious
of him but he began casting about for someone else, anyone else, to
talk to as she approached. He did not like the look on her face one
little bit. It was predatory. He shoved his hands in his pockets and
took a few steps back as she reached him and stretched out a hand,
placing it on his chest and reaching up to kiss his cheek. He thought
she lingered far too long and had he not been backed up against a
table he would have taken another five steps backwards to get away
from her. As it was he leaned his torso back as far as he could
without toppling over while Cho seemed to be purring at him and
asking if he'd had a good birthday. Casting around for an escape he
saw Ron laughing at him and shot him a venomous look.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
Harry," Cho purred, "have you had a good day? How does it feel to
be eighteen?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
it's been a good day, thanks," he said, flustered. "I – I
feel sort of, well, you know … the same." He took a step
sideways, managing to move out from under her hand. He was
disconcerted to find her following him.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
what have you been up to?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
well, I … er … flying!" he finally blurted. "New broom."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
perhaps you could take me up for a ride then?" she was batting her
eyelashes at him. Harry looked around desperately searching for Ginny
and found himself near the present table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
well can't … see gotta open these," he said trying his best to
sound authoritative as he seized one of the packages, holding it
front of himself like a shield. He could see Ron and Hermione hiding
smirks, Neville and Parvati openly grinning and Padma shaking her
head as if disgusted. He sent them all pleading looks but they were
suddenly busy inspecting shoelaces or fingernails. Harry marched over
to Ron, grabbing his arm and pulled him over to the presents.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron
is going to help me, aren't you Ron?" he said, situating Ron
between himself and Cho. Managing to stay well away from Cho Harry
and Ron opened the pile of gaily wrapped gifts revealing a large
stash of chocolates and sweets, several books about Quidditch, an
assortment of stationery and a number of items of clothing. Still
Ginny was nowhere to be seen and Cho was somehow making her way
through the present barrier Harry had erected around himself.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
something!" muttered Harry out of the side of his mouth to Ron as
she got closer.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
should I do?" hissed back Ron. "Has she not got the hint?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
you should be more direct with her," said Hermione firmly. Both of
them looked at her, horrified, as if this was possibly the least sane
course of action on the planet. At that moment Ginny finally appeared
and Harry's heart began fluttering madly about in his chest,
banishing any thought of Cho and her unwelcome advances.</p><p class="calibre8">She had
changed out of the cut off shorts and T-shirt she had been wearing
that morning and was now wearing a simple but stunning green dress
that seemed to float when she walked. Her feet were bare and her hair
had been left lying loose on her shoulders. With his eyes fixed on
her as she walked across the lawn Harry did not notice that Cho had
finally made it to his side nor did he notice the look on her face
when he ignored her and went straight over to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi
there," he said as he slid his arms around her waist and pulled her
to him. "I was wondering where you were." Ginny smiled up at him
as he lowered his voice to a whisper. "Cho's been trying to dig
her claws into me all afternoon and I don't know why she won't
take a hint!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
well perhaps this will convince her then," said Ginny with just a
hint of mischief in her voice as she reached up and kissed him,
winding her hands into his hair and pulling his head closer. Harry
did not need any encouragement and he tightened his hold on her waist
before he teased her lips open with his tongue.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!"
Harry surfaced and grinned at Ron who simply grinned back at him
before inclining his head slightly to the left. Harry twisted to look
and saw Cho, an angry look on her face slinking back to the edge of
the lawn. Harry smiled and spent the rest of his party with his hand
in Ginny's; stealing quick kisses from her while he ate and talked
to his friends.</p><p class="calibre8">It was
around sunset when Harry caught up with Oliver Wood. The two of them
began to talk about his new broomstick and Gryffindor's prospects
for winning the House Cup.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
have absolutely no idea really," said Harry. "There was no
Quidditch last year, half the previous year's team was on the run
and we've lost our Keeper. I'd say it's looking pretty dodgy to
be honest. We've got a partial team who are so out of practice it's
not funny."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
but you've got that new broom, Harry," exclaimed Oliver, "and
you are a brilliant Seeker. The other team was pretty good at the
Memorial match – how many of them will be on the team?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't see Neville agreeing to try out, but Dean and Seamus likely
will," mused Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Demelza
and the Beaters will be back too Harry," interjected Ginny. "If
Seamus is any good as a Keeper we've got a team right there."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you reckon Seamus would be any good?" Ginny shrugged and began
waving her arms as she got involved in a discussion about the various
strengths and weaknesses of the players as she saw it. Ron drifted
over and the four of them were soon engaged in a lively discussion
about how best to ensure Gryffindor's Quidditch success that year.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
pretty good yourself, Ginny," said Oliver when the discussion of
the Keeper and Beater positions had been exhausted and they had
thrashed out the weak spots on the Chaser's line up. "Have you
ever thought of going professional?" Ginny stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
mum'd go berserk!" laughed Ron. "Can you imagine it, little
Ginny, professional Quidditch star and all the danger that would
bring!" His laughter stopped abruptly when he saw her furious face.
Harry watched with amusement as Ginny advanced on her older brother
who was backing away from her, his face betraying the fact that he
was more than a little scared of her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Little?"
she hissed quietly. Ron shook his head violently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that's just a figure of speech, er, you know because, well … er
-" his eyes pleaded with Harry to say something while Ginny
advanced relentlessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
think it's funny that I could be good enough to play professional
Quidditch?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
you're good enough, absolutely positively good enough," stammered
Ron as he backed into the dessert table, putting his hand right in
the middle of a treacle tart. Ginny stopped advancing abruptly and
swung back around to face Oliver.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you for that, Oliver, I may just consider that suggestion seriously,"
her eyes narrowed at Harry, "unless anyone else has any
objections?" Harry shook his head vehemently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think it's a great idea," he smiled. Ginny turned from the
ferocious tiger that had advanced on Ron to a soft pussy cat who
purred as she wound her way back into Harry's arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
just the best boyfriend ever," she sighed against his chest and Ron
shot Harry a disgusted look and mouthed 'suck-up' at him behind
Ginny's back.</p><p class="calibre8">Bill
and Fleur had returned after work along with Mr Weasley. Percy
arrived shortly afterwards, bringing Penelope with him. As the sun
set and the lanterns that Ginny had strung up began to glow Mrs
Weasley brought out the most enormous cake that Harry had ever seen.
Decorated as a Quidditch pitch there were tiny little flyers
enchanted to play Quidditch across the top of the cake. Ron and Harry
were at first mesmerised by the tiny Quidditch game and began to
cheer on the miniscule Gryffindor players as they outmanoeuvred a
rather straggly Ravenclaw team. Padma sniffed at it and Cho glowered
when the little Ravenclaw Seeker hit the green icing turf but Luna
laughed dreamily and began to sing "Weasley is Our King". Only
when Mrs Weasley suggested it was time to cut the cake did Harry see,
for the first time, Ron at odds with the prospect of eating. To
navigate the impasse Bill conjured up a cardboard pitch and
transferred the tiny flyers to a new home. The little match lasted
four days before the enchantment wore out and it remained in pride of
place on Ron and Harry's bedroom floor until then.</p><p class="calibre8">After
Harry cut the cake someone turned on the wireless and music began
pouring out into the warm night. Angelina and Lee began dancing in
the middle of the lawn. Laughing, several others followed suit.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on Harry!" Ginny tugged at his hand pulling him towards the group
of dancers. Harry shook his head and tried to avoid it but it was no
use. He couldn't deny Ginny anything and he found himself in the
middle of the lawn, dancing with Ginny. When a slower, more romantic
song came on a short time later he showed no such reluctance in
pulling her into his arms and swaying with her on the spot as he
peppered her lips with little kisses, dancing one of his hands up and
down her spine.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
you had a good birthday?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I have. It's been almost … magical," Harry laughed at his own
little joke. "I mean a new owl, a new broomstick, hanging out with
my best friends, a party, a magnificent cake and time with my best
girl. All that's missing is the fireworks."</p><p class="calibre8">"George
was going to do fireworks," said Ginny softly, not looking at him,
"but I asked him not to. I'm sorry. I just … well … last time
…" she trailed off uncertainly. Harry looked at her; the sadness
in her eyes was palpable. He reached up, putting his fingers on her
chin and tilting her face to look at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay," he whispered softly. "I understand why you did it. Were
you scared?" Wordlessly Ginny nodded. Harry sighed heavily and
pulled her in closer. They stood there swaying for a few moments
longer, listening to the song fade away. The announcer's voice came
over the wireless then.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">And
it's a very happy birthday today to The-Boy-Who-Lived. Wherever he
is I hope he's having a good time!"</em> Nervous giggles spilled
out around the garden, the guests at Harry's party knowing how much
he hated his fame and that particular title but Harry simply threw
back his head and laughed, twirling Ginny in his arms now that a new
song was playing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
risk it," he whispered to Ginny as he pulled her close again.
"Let's find George and tell him to let the fireworks out!"
Pulling on her hand he dragged her over to George and convinced him
to set off the fireworks he'd had planned. Harry settled himself on
the grass with Ginny in his arms and watched as the first rockets
flew into the air with a bang. And when the sky writing sparklers
began writing 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY HARRY' in the sky in red and gold
and green Harry just hugged her closer and watched as the words faded
and wrote themselves over and over again.</p><p class="calibre8">As he
lowered his head to kiss Ginny's sweet lips he thought to himself
that it had been a very happy birthday indeed.</p>
