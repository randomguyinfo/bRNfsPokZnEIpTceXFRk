<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_22">*Chapter 21*: Chapter 21</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">'s
No Place Like Home</strong></p><p class="calibre8">"AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"</p><p class="calibre8">The
cry ripped through the still air of the campsite, shattering the
early morning stillness. Harry raised his head briefly from the
pillow he'd conjured to see George clutching his head on either
side while Ginny stood over him with her wand out. He smirked and
laid his head back down, burrowing into the warm sleeping bag Ernie's
mum had sent with the food. He wasn't alone for long.</p><p class="calibre8">"Morning,
Harry!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Mornin',"
he mumbled to Ginny, his eyes still closed. Something landed on his
chest with a thump and expelled his breath with a soft 'umph'.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
that how you greet me on my birthday?" Ginny asked, inches from his
face. "On my <em class="calibre9">seventeenth</em>
birthday, Mr Potter?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
could feel the tip of her wand resting on his cheek and he smiled,
opened his eyes and looked straight into hers. The sun creeping over
the horizon cast a soft light on her features and glinted off her
hair. He could see clearly the dusting of freckles across her pink
cheeks and the tip of her nose. Her eyes sparkled with mischief, and
if he'd had any breath left it would have been taken away at the
sight of her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
morning, beautiful," he whispered sincerely, "happy birthday."
Her soft pink lips curved into the faintest of smiles.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nicely
saved, Harry," she whispered back as she melted into him and
pressed her lips to his.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
thought having his arms trapped in a sleeping bag while Ginny Weasley
lay on top of him, kissing the life out of him, was perhaps the most
exquisite torture known to wizardkind. He moaned softly into her
mouth wanting to do so much more than just kiss her. He tried
valiantly to free his arms so that he could run his hands up her back
and into her hair. He nearly came undone when she made a delightful
little noise and, dropping her wand, ran both hands into his hair.
Somehow, despite the cumbersome sleeping bag, he found her underneath
him and his hands quite free to plunge into her hair and grip her
waist. He was just about to slip one hand under the waistband of her
jeans and go exploring when the moment was ruined by George.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can <em class="calibre9">hear</em>
you!" he bellowed. "Not only can I <em class="calibre9">see</em>
you but I can hear you! Every. Last. Little. Noise."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
stopped abruptly and lifted his head from where he'd been doing
something quite delightful to Ginny's neck. Ginny made a strangled
noise of discontent. George was glaring at them, two enormously large
ears growing from the sides of his head, the lobes almost touching
the ground as he sat in his own sleeping bag. Harry put his forehead
down on Ginny's and began to chuckle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
if he doesn't want me to <em class="calibre9">hear</em>
so much he deserves to hear exceptionally well, to make up for it,"
whispered Ginny with a grin. George made a disgusted noise as Harry
bent his head once again to Ginny's neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nice
work," Harry complimented her. Ginny giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
it you two," grumbled George, before raising his voice slightly.
"Oi! Knock it off you lot!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked up quizzically but didn't have to wait long before Bill
poked his head out of his tent. His hair was mussed and he looked
flushed and particularly unhappy. Ron and Hermione soon emerged from
the other tent.</p><p class="calibre8">"Knock
what off, George – whoa!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can hear every noise you lot are making, you know," said George
conversationally. "It's not pleasant."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
disagree," growled Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"From
this side," clarified George.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
did you get those ears mate?" asked Ron trying but failing to
conceal his laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"His
girlfriend did this to me," said George in an accusatory tone,
pointing at Harry as if it was his fault. Harry struggled to sit up,
his legs still tangled in the sleeping bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
that's nice," said Ginny as she looked for her wand, "you've
disowned me now. I'm not your sister anymore, just <em class="calibre9">his</em>
girlfriend?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
only a matter of time Ginny, before you belong to <em class="calibre9">him</em>,"
said George seriously. "We may as well get used to it."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
saw Ginny scowl at her brother and begin fingering her wand and he
put out a hand to stop her. She looked at him, her eyes full of fury
but he begged her silently to keep still. George looked up at Ginny,
an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
used to be our little Gin-Gin," he said softly, "and it was our
job to protect you, take care of you and look after you. To love
you." Ginny's face softened and she got up and went over to
George, curling herself up in his lap. Bill emerged from the tent
then, buttoning the waistband on his jeans, his shirt slung over his
shoulder. George continued.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
now you're all grown up and legal," he said putting his arms
around her, "and it's not our job any more." Bill stood looking
at them, shivering slightly in the frigid morning air.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
not our little Ginny any more," said Ron softly as she hugged
George, somehow managing to work around his massive ears. "Not our
girl. You're <em class="calibre9">his</em>
girl and that's the way we like it."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
does Charlie. Percy's in denial," added George, managing to lay
his head on Ginny's shoulder, flicking the left ear out of the way.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred
…" he began, his voice faltering and cracking, "he wanted you
to be with Harry. He wanted you to be Harry's girl if you couldn't
be ours anymore." Ginny smiled fondly at George.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
still your little sister. Your little Gin-Gin," she said softly,
"even now I'm all grown up you're still my big brothers. I love
you." Harry smiled softly as Ron knelt next to Ginny and George and
put his arms around them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy
birthday Ginny," he said pulling them tight. Bill joined them only
a moment later, the four of them tangling in a heap.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy
birthday, Gorgeous," said Bill, squeezing them tight.
"Congratulations. "</p><p class="calibre8">"Guys,
you're hurting my ears," said George. Harry laughed as they
separated and George looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll
look after our girl won't you Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
said Harry, "I'll look after your girl." Bill looked at Harry
then, an odd expression on his face that Harry couldn't quite
decipher and Ginny smiled at him from George's lap where she fondly
stroked his oversized ears as he scowled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
it's a bit overprotective," George said softly to Harry a moment
later. "But it doesn't matter how grown up she is, she's still
our little sister but she's your girl now." Ginny snorted
indelicately but did not protest the sentiment.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
no one else we trust," Ron said quietly. Harry realised that
although he didn't need it and although they didn't have to give
it, he had the approval of Ron and George who, much like their father
had entrusted him with her happiness, had entrusted her care and
safety to him. It was an approval that guaranteed there would be no
interference in their relationship and that they respected it as
taking precedence. He looked at Ginny as she sat between her
brothers, a wide smile on her face as George tried to tickle her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
remember when you were born. It was amazing, you were so tiny and so
pink and a <em class="calibre9">girl</em>."
said Bill softly. "Mum was rapt and we all knew that you were
special. I can't believe you're seventeen."</p><p class="calibre8">"Neither
can I!" she said brightly. "I can't believe I have been
seventeen for more than six hours and I still haven't been given a
single present!" Bill laughed and fished a small box out of his
pocket.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dad
brought this around just before we left, he asked me to wish you a
happy birthday from him and mum," said Bill. He continued softly as
Fleur emerged from the tent and came over to sit on his lap, draping
a sleeping bag over the two of them. "Dad said they would have been
here if they could."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
and maybe then Mum would make you take these ears off," complained
George. "Everything's so loud. Can't you take them off now,
please?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,"
said Hermione quietly, Harry was startled, he'd forgotten she was
there, "how did you make both of his ears bigger when he only has
one?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't make them bigger," said Ginny absently as she tugged at
the bow on the small box Bill had given her. "I put new ones on."</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
you put smaller ones on?" asked Hermione intently, moving closer to
George and inspecting his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe,"
said Ginny thoughtfully as she paused just before pulling the lid off
the box. "I didn't try." George twisted his ear out of
Hermione's grasp but Hermione made an exasperated noise and pulled
him back, examining the ear on the side of his head where he had no
ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
long do you think they'll last?" murmured Hermione. Ginny
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know Hermione, I didn't intend to give him massive ears
forever!" She went back to her present and pulled the lid off,
rustling in the tissue paper inside.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
… can we take them off now?" whined George. "That rustling is
very annoying."</p><p class="calibre8">"Talking
must be killing you," said Ron louder than necessary and George
threw him a filthy look. Ginny sighed and waved her wand vaguely in
his direction and the ears vanished.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you," George breathed, feeling the sides of his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
welcome," said Ginny with a grin as she pulled a delicate watch
from the box. "Oh!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
watched as Bill helped her fasten it then Fleur handed her a flat
box. It contained a small, delicate hand mirror and matching
hairbrush. Jonathon roused himself and wished Ginny a happy birthday
before he ducked into the girls' tent. Ernie raised his head and
snorted, mumbling something about Bert and beds and tension before he
pulled his sleeping bag back over his head.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry just sat and
watched as Ginny opened a book from Hermione and as Ron and George
presented her with a large box of chocolates. The early morning sun
glinted off her hair and her smile was captivating. Harry smiled as
he watched her thank her brothers and Hermione before she tore open
the box of chocolates and, carefully selecting one, popped it into
her mouth. She was beautiful and Harry couldn't take his eyes off
her as she ate chocolates for breakfast and flipped through the book
Hermione had given her. He pulled his knees up to his chest, resting
his chin on them, and watched as George picked up the brush and
pulled it through her red tresses. George said something that was
obviously teasing and Ginny turned and poked her tongue out at him.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
was content but he ached to hold her, to kiss her. As if she could
read his thoughts Ginny suddenly looked up from the box of chocolates
and caught his gaze. He held it steadily as she put the book and the
chocolates aside and climbed off George's lap. She approached him
slowly, the few steps between them taking forever and Harry lowered
his knees and leaning back on his hands, raised his head as she
approached so that he was still looking into her eyes. Ginny stood
still for a moment only inches from him and tilted her head to one
side.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
you got something for me, Mr Potter?" she asked, in a seductive and
teasing tone.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you looking for your birthday present, Miss Weasley?" he replied.
She nodded cheekily and Harry continued. "I do believe that I would
like to give you the same thing you gave me when I came of age."
Harry detangled himself from the sleeping bag and stood up, pulling
her to him, no longer the least bit shy or embarrassed that he was
about to kiss her senseless while under the attention of three of her
brothers.</p><p class="calibre8">He
kissed her then, pouring all his feelings into the kiss. Ginny
responded eagerly, demanding entrance to his mouth almost
immediately, her hands going straight to tangle in his hair. Harry
let his hands pull her closer as he lost himself in her and he dimly
wondered if this was a present for her or for him. He didn't know
how long they stood there, on the desert floor, sun streaming over
the horizon as they kissed. He didn't care either and he took his
time slowly exploring her lips and teeth and every inch of her mouth.
When he pulled away breathless, he noticed they were alone, Ginny's
birthday presents in a pile on George's discarded sleeping bag,
everyone else some distance away looking through the esky for
breakfast.</p><p class="calibre8">"Happy
birthday," he breathed. "I love you." Ginny smiled at him
before pulling out her wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Accio
</em>birthday
present!" she cried and Harry laughed as a little box sailed out of
the tent where he had given it to Fleur for safe keeping, and to hide
it from Ginny who had taken to exploring his pockets the day before
in an effort to find it. She opened it slowly and gasped at the
necklace inside. It was a simple opal pendant, but the stone was
alive with the colours of the rainbow. Harry plucked it from the box
and motioned for her to turn around. Carefully he fastened it around
her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
jeweller said opals have fire in them," he said softly. "Fire
trapped in a stone and that's what makes it beautiful. Just like
the fire inside you makes you irresistibly beautiful." He finished
fastening the clasp and Ginny turned to face him, the pendant resting
on her chest, the colours flashing as the sun's rays struck it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you," she whispered and Harry kissed her lips tenderly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
welcome," said Harry softly, and then, just because he could, he
kissed her again, winding his fingers into her hair and pressing her
body to his. The scent and smell of sizzling bacon drifted across the
campsite and teased his nostrils but he kept kissing Ginny until she
pulled away. He felt bereft at the loss and his head instinctively
followed her as she backed away. It took a strangled noise from Ginny
to make him open his eyes. She was looking at him intently and he
thought he would melt under the intensity of it. Her face was flushed
and her lips were bruised and swollen. He reached up a thumb to
softly stroke her bottom lip and she sucked in a breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
need to shave," she whispered with a glint in her eye that either
meant mischief or hilarity. Harry smiled ruefully at her as he
realised why she had pulled away. "Not that I don't think that
stubble<em class="calibre9">
looks</em>
unbelievably sexy." Harry remained rooted to the spot as she
trailed a hand down the rough stubble on his cheek and sauntered away
to collect her birthday presents. He watched her go back to her tent
and remained staring after her long after she had disappeared.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi,
Potter! Give us a hand with breakfast you lazy sod!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked over at Ron and grinned before ambling over to inspect the
contents of the frying pan. Ernie was holding several pieces of bread
over the fire on long sticks to toast them while Jonathon watched
Bill poke at some sausages as they sizzled in a pan.</p><p class="calibre8">"-this
obsession you Poms have with a cooked brekkie," Bert was saying as
she sat, hunched in front of the fire, a bowl and spoon in her hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong with a cooked brekkie?" asked Jonathon in a most offended
tone. Bert snorted in a very unladylike fashion.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong with good old fashioned Weet-Bix?" she asked airily, waving
her spoon aloft and flicking milk and brown pulp around her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!"
cried George ducking and weaving to avoid being splattered with the
soggy missile. "Watch it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Weet-Bix
is <em class="calibre9">boring</em>,"
said Jonathon decisively. "I like a cooked brekkie."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
well don't you expect me to cook you any brekkie in January when it
hits 30 degrees before dawn," uttered Bert ominously as she scooped
up whatever disgusting thing was in her cereal bowl and ate it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
I expect your company for breakfast in January?" asked Jonathon
softly. Bert dropped her spoon into her now empty bowl with a small
clatter and looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
depends on if you marry me before New Year," she replied. Jonathon
regarded her, neither of them breaking eye contact.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
marry you tomorrow if you'll have me," said Jonathon in a voice
devoid of all joking humour. Bert tilted her head as she studied him
intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really,"
he nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
to run the Roobus tomorrow," said Ernie suddenly. "Make up for
the lost time." Jonathon turned to look at Ernie who was
unconcernedly dropping the toast he had made on a plate next to him
and spearing the next piece of bread. Bert exploded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
ruin my proposal like that!" she screeched at him and George
stifled a snort.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
was a proposal?" asked Ron, his nose screwed up as he looked from
Bert to Jonathon and back again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sat'day'd
be better," said Ernie, twirling the toast as he held it over the
fire. He looked thoughtful. "You could go buy a dress mebbee if
Johno helps me on the bus on Friday."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me that," muttered Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gavin'd
give you a room at The Bucket on Sat'day," continued Ernie
blithely, stacking the toast into a carefully constructed tower. "You
could put on a good bash without too much trouble."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
– you can't just get married like that!" exclaimed Hermione,
she looked utterly scandalised. "What about planning and guest
lists and menus and – and …" Jonathon looked up at her,
eyebrows raised but Bert smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
a wedding, Hermione," she said simply. "You can get married
without all the menus and the planning." Jonathon reached out and
took Bert's hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you want to get married?" he asked her. Bert stared at their joined
hands for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
haven't wanted anything else so much for six years," she said
quietly. "I want to be with you, to laugh with you, to love with
you, to live with you, to wake up with you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"To
go to bed with you," interrupted Ernie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ernie!"
Bert was blushing to the roots of her hair and Harry could see Ernie
hiding a grin as he meticulously buttered the tower of toast he'd
been cooking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Marry
me on Saturday then," said Jonathon seriously. "You could even
wear a dress, I wouldn't mind." Bert laughed, Hermione shook her
head and Fleur looked positively horrified.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
said Bert, "yes I'll marry you on Saturday. I might even wear a
dress."</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
I should stock up on Weet-Bix then?" asked Jonathon laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
said we're living at your place?" Bert questioned indignantly,
but instead of answering her Jonathon pulled her to him and crushed
her lips to his in a searing kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thees
ees ridiculous!" said Fleur emphatically. "You cannot just get
<em class="calibre9">married</em>
like zat!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
not?" demanded George. "Cuts out a lot of the fuss you had when
you got married." Fleur glowered at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Less
for Mum to fuss over as well," added Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
chance for Auntie Muriel to force her tiara on your head," muttered
Ginny who had arrived during the preceding conversation and was now
making George twitch by twirling her wand at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
I'd like to see you three tell Mum you're getting married in less
than a week and having the reception in a pub," chortled Bill,
eyeing his younger siblings.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
even think about it Ron," said Hermione idly, as she searched for
something to spread on her toast. Ron spluttered and fell silent.
Harry just grinned at him as he brought Ginny a plateful of bacon and
eggs for breakfast which she accepted with a grateful smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look
at you, all chivalrous and gallant," Ron teased and with a flick of
her wand Ginny made Ron's nose grow. Her brother ruefully shook his
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
forgot you can do that now," he muttered and this earned him the
loss of his eyebrows. He opened his mouth, presumably to complain
about that.</p><p class="calibre8">"A
Bat Bogey on a nose that size, Ron?"</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
sat quietly after that trying to eat his breakfast under his
oversized nose until Ginny took pity on him and shrank it back so he
could eat his toast. Harry had idly poked a finger at the pressed
wheat flake biscuits that Bert had been eating but decided he
preferred bacon and eggs over the brown slosh they turned into when
Bert added milk to her second helping. Jonathon and Bert sat close
together next to the fire, Jonathon balancing a plate of bacon, eggs
and toast while Bert teased him about putting marmalade on his toast
instead of Vegemite.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
gone all Pommy," she teased; affecting a superior tone that Harry
guessed she imagined to be a British accent. "First, bacon and eggs
for breakfast and now marmalade on one's toast."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
like marmalade," protested Jonathon, but it was without ire, his
fingers caressed Bert's thigh as he spoke, edging towards the hem
of her shorts. "You're just an Aussie kid, through and through
with your Weet-Bix and your Vegemite."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
right," affirmed Bert as she picked up a piece of toast and
slathered it in Vegemite.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
disgusting," said Jonathon as he wrinkled his nose at her but Bert
simply took a big bite and chewed provocatively. Jonathon wound his
arm around her waist and picked up his own toast with his other hand
and the two of them munched in silence, Bert laying her head on
Jonathon's shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you two really going to get married on Saturday?" Harry asked them.
Jonathon smiled and Bert nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Eet
ees madness," sniffed Fleur. "A wedding, it takes more zan buying
a dress and renting a room."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?"
asked Ginny suddenly. "Why can't it just be buying a dress and
having a place for everyone to celebrate with you? Why do you have to
plan menus and decorations and things?" Fleur looked at her
blankly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
Ginny," began Hermione, "don't you want to make your wedding
special?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
are you saying their wedding won't be special?" questioned
George, indicating Bert and Jonathon. "I think it's a brilliant
idea. I might steal it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
no – no th- that's not what I meant," Hermione stammered. "But
your wedding is something special that reflects who you are, isn't
it? I think it reflects Bert and Jonathon perfectly, but can you see
Ginny getting married in a pub?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
I'm not going to get married in a pub!" exclaimed Ginny. "But
there's also no way I'm colour matching anything or making
vol-au-vents!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
I don't know, Ginny," interjected Ron, "there's something
quite alluring about the Hogs Head." Ginny gave him a withering
look and fingered her wand. Ron fell silent.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
it's a reflection of you, Hermione," said George thoughtfully,
"are you going to get married in a Quidditch pitch full of books?"</p><p class="calibre8">"With
an orange theme?" added Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
look hideous in orange," mused Ginny. The tips of Ron's ears were
going red and Hermione flushed a pale pink. Harry smiled and noted
that neither of them denied anything as Ron's siblings continued
their gentle ribbing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
Mum could make one of those Quidditch pitch cakes!" crowed George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Snitches
for wedding favours," said Ginny with glee.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
should have it at Halloween," George insisted. "That would be
fantastic because it incorporates the orange and provides a perfect
backdrop for the black spiders!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Spiders?"
squeaked Ron, suddenly finding his voice. "What spiders?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
isn't a wedding about bringing two people together?" asked
George. "Celebrating who they are and that they want to share their
lives … forever and ever and ever? Rejoicing in their personalities
and celebrating their union. Becoming one and sharing all their hopes
and dreams and fears … like spiders."</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you bring any spiders anywhere near our wedding, I'll have Hermione
hex you so bad you can't walk for a week!" grumbled Ron. "She'd
do it too, if you ruined her wedding."</p><p class="calibre8">"George,"
huffed Fleur, "zat is so immature. You weel not bring ze spiders to
Ron and Hermione's wedding." She turned to Ginny: "You'll
see, there is nothing wrong with vol-au-vents. We can plan ze most
beautiful wedding for you. Ta Mère,
she eez
magnifique
at the planning, non? Hermione, you will 'elp, non?" Hermione
nodded; grateful the attention was off her and Ron. Ginny narrowed
her eyes at them.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
make it sound like I <em class="calibre9">am</em>
planning to get married."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
are not?" enquired Fleur as she turned to look at Harry who felt
his face heat up as the attention fell on him. Fleur made an
indistinct noise in the back of her throat. "But eet takes months
to prepare ze wedding! I was doing ze planning for more zan a year!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
shot back Ginny heatedly, "but you didn't start planning until
after you got engaged. And that's my point. A dress and somewhere
to celebrate doesn't need a year of planning. If you and Mum aren't
careful, I'll just elope."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
ze preparation-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't need the Burrow to look like a manicured French garden-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
ze garden gnomes-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
<em class="calibre9">like</em>
garden gnomes!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!"
shouted Ron. "D'you two think you might call a truce over a
wedding that isn't even on yet?" Bill laid a hand on his wife's
arm and she subsided a little. Ginny still looked a little fierce and
she glowered at Fleur as she crossed her arms across her chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
your birthday Ginny," said Hermione sounding a little strained.
"Let's not fight." Ginny looked rather sheepishly at the
ground.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,"
she mumbled. Fleur reached over and patted her on the arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Eet
ees okay, ma chérie," she said as she smoothed Ginny's hair back
from her face. "Whatever you plan, eet weel be beautiful, non?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
been rather quiet, Harry," said Bill suddenly. "As Best Man have
you any objections to wearing a fantastically orange cravat and
eating from specially hollowed out Quaffles on placemats that look
like pages from <em class="calibre9">Hogwarts,
a History</em>?"
Hermione made a strangled noise while George laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
about your wedding, any ideas?" George asked. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know anything about weddings," he said. "I've only ever
been to one. I've certainly never thought about mine. You tend not
to do that when you don't think you have a future." His words
sounded harsh after they'd left his mouth and he saw a few
uncomfortable faces. Ron seemed completely at ease. He swallowed the
bacon in his mouth before speaking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Reckon
you've got one now though," he said and grinned cheekily. "I
still think the Hogs Head has merit." Harry grinned at him and
shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where
do you want to get married, Harry?" asked Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">He
studied her for a moment, the flashing in the gemstone around her
neck matching her hair. She was looking at him as though she was
trying to see inside him. He just couldn't picture having an
argument with his mother over where to hold his wedding or he and his
father being drafted to sort favours and make canapés. As much as
Ginny protested Harry knew she would not want to exclude her mother
or her sister-in-law from being involved in planning their wedding.
Nor stop her family from being there and his heart ached for a moment
because his own parents would not be there.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
knew that he wouldn't be able to elope, he had no family to be
there so he wanted every last Weasley there instead, even Auntie
Muriel and her goblin made tiara. Dudley flickered across his mind as
he contemplated Ginny's question. Perhaps he would come if they
invited him. He became aware that the entire camp seemed to be
waiting for his answer and he felt like he needed to give them one.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
wish my parents could be there," he said instead and Ginny reached
out to entwine his fingers with hers, squeezing his hand gently. He
looked up at her and smiled. "You could fight with my mum about how
many vol-au-vents to make."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
would have given that my best effort," said Ginny smiling although
there were tears in the corners of her eyes. Harry looked down at
their entwined hands, studying the scars on the back of his hand and
the freckles on the back of hers. Her fingernails were pale pink
ovals and there was a faint ink stain on her index finger.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
want to get married where my parents did," Harry said at last.
"It's the closest I can get to having them there." Ginny leaned
over and kissed him then, a lone tear falling and Harry wiped it away
and pulled her close.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
that certainly makes their orange Quidditch wedding sound lame,"
said George and Hermione threw him a withering look.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
am <em class="calibre9">not</em>
getting married on a Quidditch pitch, George," she said stiffly.
"Nor will it be <em class="calibre9">orange</em>."
George looked ready to argue the point, until he caught sight of Ron
who was glaring at him and falling silent, George became intent on
spreading his toast with some Vegemite.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where
did your parents get married, Harry?" asked Ron as he wiped the
grease from his plate with a slice of bread. Harry wondered just how
healthy that was as he shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
idea."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
we'll find out," said Ginny firmly. "There must be someone who
was there who can tell us."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know who," said Harry softly. "Sirius was dad's Best
Man, Remus would have known, Dumbledore would have known. But who's
left?" Hermione looked thoughtful.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid,"
she said suddenly. "Hagrid will know." Harry smiled and tightened
his hold on Ginny, running one hand under the hem of her jumper to
caress the soft flesh of her stomach. She leaned back into him and
closed her eyes, resting her head on his shoulder and Harry was
fascinated by the expression of contentment on her face as he drew
lazy circles with his index finger. When George called out a
sarcastic comment about 'vomit inducing behaviour' and Ernie told
them to get a room and then laughed uproariously at his own joke
Harry only lowered his head to kiss Ginny's neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
encourage them," said Bill in a strangled voice. Ginny opened her
eyes and looked at Bill pointedly. Eventually Bill sighed and looked
away.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
going for a walk," said Ginny as she stood up. It was clear she
intended Harry to come along for she had not let go of his hand
before striding off. Harry hastily put his plate down and followed
her mumbling that he would just go with her. It was some time before
Ginny spoke; the Roobus was a speck in the distance as Ginny sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought they were okay with us," she said quietly. Harry pulled her
into his arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
are," he said as he lowered his head to her neck, kissing her
there. "I don't want to watch people going at it all the time and
we have been in pretty close quarters the last day or so. Maybe we're
getting a bit carried away …" He trailed off, not wanting to
really believe that because her lips were currently doing something
unbelievable to his neck and he bent swiftly to capture her lips with
his own. The two of them did not return to the campsite for at least
another half an hour.</p><p class="calibre8">When
they did return it was to see an unfamiliar backside sticking out
from the open compartment on the Roobus. It was accompanied by
several swear words and a loud thumping noise interspersed with
clanks and clangs. Harry looked to Ron for an explanation.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
Uncle Mick," said Ron. "New thought box is here." It seemed as
though Uncle Mick was having some trouble installing the new thought
box and he suddenly pulled his head abruptly from the compartment,
fixing a beady eye on Ernie.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
you been playing at with the maintenance?" he demanded of Ernie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bert
did it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Might've
known that mess was done by a woman," grumbled Uncle Mick. Bert
bristled visibly but didn't say anything, perhaps aware that Uncle
Mick's installation of the thought box was their ticket out of the
desert. "Well it'll go all right now. You can get back to your
civilisation now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Uncle," said Ernie sincerely but Uncle Mick only grunted in reply.
He seemed to notice Harry and Ginny then and a grin stole over his
features.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd
best be gettin' back," he said. "Make sure you swing in and see
your mum before you go Ernie."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
yeah."</p><p class="calibre8">"Might
wanna buy yourselves a paper too," Uncle Mick winked at Harry and
Ginny before he Disapparated with a loud crack. They made short work
of packing up the campsite and boarding the Roobus. Before long they
had arrived back at the Yulara resort to be greeted a short, plump
woman who simultaneously managed to scold Ernie for not packing up
the tents properly and engulf Bert and Jonathon in a massive hug.</p><p class="calibre8">It
didn't take them long to offload the camping supplies and after
collecting Arkie they found themselves back on the road. The journey
to Melbourne was without mishap which was more than could be said for
their arrival. Setting the Roobus down in the middle of Swanston
Street it jerked chaotically and a loud snapping sound accompanied a
flash of yellow light.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fair
Dinkum, Ernie," said Bert as she sighed heavily. "You've
tangled the bus in the tramlines again! Could ya stop doing that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
worry about it," said Arkie as he disembarked, "trams get delayed
all the time. Muggles're used to it. See you next week Ern." He
wandered off down the street and was soon lost in the crowd of
Muggles on the footpath.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?
What's happened?" Hermione asked. Her face was white and she
looked panicked. "Is the bus broken again? Are we going to be stuck
here now? We're never going to get to my parents are we? We'll be
stuck here forever and so will they and the whole trip will have been
pointless and a great big disaster-" Ron cut her off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Relax
Hermione," he said, taking her hand and stroking the back of it.
"Nothing's going to stop us from getting to your parents. It's
a minor mishap and Ernie knows how to fix it. Don't you Ernie?"
Harry could see Ron glare at Ernie as if daring him to say he could
not and Ernie merely nodded shortly and got out his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">Bert
and Ernie spent a good fifteen minutes detangling the Roobus and
Hermione's face didn't change, it remained pasty white. As they
trouped back onto the bus Bert assured Hermione that they would
arrive in Yackandandah by lunchtime. Hermione seemed to relax a
little at that but it wasn't long before she began fretting about
whether or not her parents would be mad at her for bewitching them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron,"
she said, "what if they hate me?" She was fiddling with her wand
absently and it started emitting bright purple sparks that she seemed
completely unaware of.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
won't hate you, Hermione," soothed Ron, taking her wand and
tucking it into his back pocket. "They love you, they'll be glad
to see you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Will,
they? Do you really think so?" asked Hermione. Ron nodded and put
an arm around her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
I think I'm going to be sick," she moaned and Ernie brought the
bus to a hurried stop. Harry was impressed with the way Ron didn't
bat an eyelid, just held Hermione's hair out of her face as she
retched on the side of the road. They hadn't gone very far up the
road when Hermione began to worry again.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
if I've botched the charm up so badly I'll never be able to take
it off?" she wailed.</p><p class="calibre8">"It'll
be fine, Hermione," Bill said. "You don't botch things up."
He smiled at her but Hermione only stared at him before threatening
to be sick again. Ernie brought the Roobus to a screeching halt and
while Ron and Harry attempted to calm Hermione down the others went
in search of refreshment. They returned with some cakes, pastries and
sly grins.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
lot look like the cat that got the cream," observed Ron as he
rubbed a circle on Hermione's back. Ginny grinned at them and
thrust a newspaper under Ron's nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"There
is a wizarding shop back there and look what we found," she said
with glee. Ron unfolded the paper and Harry peered over Hermione's
shoulder as she read it aloud.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">HARRY
POTTER FINDS TRUE LOVE</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">A
revealing interview with Harry Potter's closest family and friends
was published in London yesterday. </em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Published
in the evening edition of </em>The
Quibbler<em class="calibre9">,
a tabloid newspaper that Mr Potter appears to endorse, the article
was written by friends of the heroic wizard and includes several
revealing photographs taken by the late Mr Colin Creevey, one of Mr
Potter's close personal friends.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Our
sources in Britain were unable to be contacted last night, a
mysterious note citing incapacity due to bug infestation was the only
correspondence received. Contact with </em>The
Quibbler<em class="calibre9">'s
editor however revealed the accuracy of the article. This publication
is forced to conclude that certain errors were made in previous
reports of Mr Potter's current activities and we apologise to Mr
Potter and Miss Weasley for the error. </em></p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
that's nice of them isn't it?" snorted Ron indelicately. "What
did <em class="calibre9">The
Quibbler</em>
say, Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Continued
page six," muttered Hermione as she rifled through the newspaper,
opening the page to show a large photograph of Harry and Ginny,
kissing in the Gryffindor Common Room, with an inset photo of him and
Teddy taken at the Christening. Under it an article, interspersed
with photographs of his time at Hogwarts, sporting the headline
<em class="calibre9">POTTER
FINDS HIS PRINCESS</em>
took up the rest of the page. Harry had never seen the picture of him
and Ginny before, he realised that Colin must have taken it after
they won the Quidditch Cup in sixth year as Ron groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
was traumatic enough the first time," he complained and Harry
slugged him on the shoulder. "Ow, what'd you do that for?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What'd
you be a git for?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
it you two," scolded Hermione. She frowned, "the headline's a
bit tacky."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
like it," said Ginny twirling on the spot as if showing off a
magnificent ball gown. Harry grinned at her. "I like being a
princess." Hermione smiled and began to read the article aloud.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">A
visit to a quaint little cottage on the edge of Ottery St. Catchpole
in Devon, will lead you to the current home of Britain's newest
hero, Harry Potter. In a house brimming with character and love, Mr
Potter has found peace with his family. Large gardens, brimming with
undiscovered treasures, speak of a place where children once roamed
free before traipsing back to the family home for hot drinks and
cuddles. Where children's photographs and art line the walls and
family means everything. It is in the cramped kitchen that we find
Molly Weasley her cauldrons brimming with delicious stews and her
heart overflowing with love for her family.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Harry
was eleven when I first met him,' she tells this reporter. "All
skinny arms and knobbly knees-"</em></p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't have skinny arms!" Hermione ignored Harry's outburst and
kept reading.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">-knobbly
knees. He was the sweetest, most polite little thing. He's been as
good as one of mine since then you know." Molly Weasley looks
rather fierce as she says this and the expression on her face cannot
be mistaken for anything other than maternal pride. As matriarch of
this humble home she is the epitome of motherly love which shows in
the way she speaks of each of her children and that includes Harry
Potter. His picture hangs on the wall next to the rest of the
children and his hand on the family clock rests on 'abroad' with
several others of the Weasley offspring</em>.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't know you had a hand on the clock, Harry," said Ron. Harry
shrugged because he didn't know that either.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dad
was getting it made before we left, I guess it finally arrived,"
said Bill. "It was supposed to be there for your birthday, Harry,
but it just didn't arrive in time." Hermione cleared her throat
pointedly and continued.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">A
home as rich in love as this one would find unthinkable the notion
that marriages and matches can be made based on monetary concerns.
The oldest Weasley child, William, who married former Tri-wizard
Champion Fleur Delacour a year ago in this very home, is currently in
Australia with Mr Potter and Miss Weasley.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Wonderful
girl, wonderful,' says Mr Arthur Weasley of his daughter-in-law.
"Young Bill couldn't have made a better match. All of the
children have made very sensible choices; it doesn't do to
interfere with true love.' When questioned, Mr Weasley confirmed
that neither he nor his wife had arranged a match for their only
daughter. An elderly Aunt of his wife's had attempted to do so but
Mr Weasley was most insistent to this reporter that such an action as
arranging a marriage was far outside his experiences or intentions.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">We
will be celebrating another marriage in the near future,' he
confirmed, but denied that it was his daughter's, citing her return
to school and waiting Hogwarts letter as proof."</em></p><p class="calibre8">"Who's
getting married?" exclaimed Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hogwarts
letters," breathed Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
that's great Hermione," said Harry impatiently, "keep reading!"</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">He
confirmed that both his daughter and Mr Potter are returning to
Hogwarts for the autumn term with no plans for marriage, arranged or
otherwise. </em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Young
Ginevra is almost certainly in love with Harry,' adds third oldest
Weasley son, Percy. 'The very idea that our parents would interfere
with her romantic attachments is laughable. They have similarly
refrained from hampering my own activities.' A large diamond ring
in evidence on the left ring finger of Mr Weasley's companion, a
Miss Penelope Clearwater, gives evidence to his own romantic
activities</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy's
getting married?" questioned Ron incredulously. George was grinning
with barely suppressed glee. Harry could see him planning various
nefarious deeds in light of this revelation. Hermione continued
reading.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Mr
Potter's friends confirm Percy's claim that the liaison between
Mr Potter and his only sister is not the result of a post war nuptial
agreement, nor does it violate any relationship between he and Miss
Hermione Granger. Miss Lavender Brown seems very definite that Miss
Granger is in fact going out with Mr Ronald Weasley, the youngest of
the Weasley sons and Mr Potter's best friend.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">She's
been sweet on him for ages,' agrees Mr Seamus Finnegan, who has
shared a dormitory at Hogwarts with both Mr Potter and Mr Weasley
since they were eleven</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
what rot," huffed Hermione. "He's just making that up, <em class="calibre9">ages</em>
indeed. Honestly." Harry and Ginny exchanged a look of amusement
over her head and George laughed outright.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione
dear, it's been obvious to the rest of us since you were second
years," he chuckled in a fair impression of his mother. "If you
two had taken any longer to get on with it I think you might have
both self combusted with the effort of holding it in!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Piss
off," muttered Ron, the tips of his ears as red as Harry had ever
seen them. Hermione cleared her throat and continued reading as if to
ignore George completely.</p><p class="calibre8">"-Seamus Finnegan,
who has shared … <em class="calibre9">'It's
always been Hermione and Ron, anyone who thinks Hermione's with
Harry needs their head read.' The love lives of Hogwarts students
indeed never run smooth but as three young men will attest, Miss
Ginevra Weasley has never used a love potion. Mr Neville Longbottom,
who himself has recently ended a brief relationship with one of Mr
Potter's previous involvements-</em>"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
wasn't <em class="calibre9">involved</em>
with Parvati!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What!
Neville and Parvati have split up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oooh
I hope he gets together with Hannah now. He was trying to get up the
nerve all last year." Hermione cleared her throat pointedly before
continuing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville
says … <em class="calibre9">Ginny
Weasley has been faithful to Mr Potter, despite their separation over
the last year.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">She
really loves him, you know?' says Mr Longbottom. 'I took her to a
dance once, in fourth year. I think she loved him even then. We're
pretty good friends, she certainly never used a potion on me.' This
is a sentiment echoed by Mr Michael Corner and Mr Dean Thomas who
once went out with the beautiful young woman. Both confirm that they
were never slipped a love potion.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">We
heard what happened when Ron was slipped one,' says Mr Thomas.
'There's no way I ever acted like that. Harry doesn't act like
that either; he's as in love with her as she is with him.'</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">It's
hard to compete with Harry Potter,' adds Mr Corner. 'They're
probably soulmates. He comes first with Ginny. She'll hex you if
you suggest otherwise</em>.'"</p><p class="calibre8">"And
don't you know that first hand, Corner," murmured Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Speaking
to Mr Potter's family and friends it is easy to see that this young
hero is surrounded by family and friends who love him, including a
beautiful young lady who adores him as much as he adores her.
Certainly anyone who was present when they kissed for the first time
(pictured right) will attest to that. </em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Mr
Potter does have one responsibility however, that of godfather to
Teddy Lupin (pictured inset), a four month old who has been left a
war orphan as Mr Potter was in the first war. Teddy's grandmother
assures us that rather than collecting the spoils of war Harry Potter
is simply having the quiet and loving life which he so desperately
craved his entire youth. He is lucky enough to have a family more
than willing to give it to him. Little Teddy, who is the son of the
former Professor Remus Lupin and his Auror wife, Nymphadora Tonks,
spends a great deal of time with Mr Potter and by all accounts he
dotes on the boy as if he were his father.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Harry
couldn't be a better godfather,' says Andromeda Tonks, the boy's
guardian. 'He's just lovely with him. When he does have his own
children he'll be a great dad.' He certainly sounds like a fine
catch, ladies but this one just happens to be taken, and according to
all sources, he's not going anywhere.</em></p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">Harry
means the world to us, like the rest of our boys,' Molly Weasley
assures us. 'This is his home.' We at this publication wish Mr
Potter all the best for his future plans and remind him to beware of
Bunyips while he's Down Under</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
Luna certainly did a marvellous job," said Hermione briskly as she
folded the paper meticulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing
at all, why do you ask, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
got your irritated face on and you sound all … annoyed."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
– my what?" asked Hermione, staring at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
irritated face," repeated Harry. "The one you wear when you think
someone's got a fact wrong." Hermione simply stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I think Seamus went a little overboard," she started and George
snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let
it go," he said. "Fred had been running a book on it since the
end of our fourth year. He knew it would take you two ages to figure
it out and he made a killing fleecing everyone who thought it would
happen in the near future."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't believe you ran a book on that!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't, Ronald. Fred did." Ron merely snorted and muttered that
it amounted to the same thing.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
merely had a bet for next year," answered George cheekily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
had last year," said Ginny, settling herself in Harry's lap. "He
cleaned me out." Harry grew tired of discussing Ron and Hermione's
love life and while they and George argued good naturedly, Harry slid
his arms around Ginny's waist and nuzzled his face into her neck,
finding a soft patch of skin behind her ear and kissing it softly.
Ginny arched her neck in response and Harry responded to the unspoken
request by kissing down the length of her neck to her shoulder.
Bringing his mouth back up to her ear he kissed it before whispering
to her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello
Princess."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
giggled before turning her head to look at him. Possibly she was
about to say something but Harry wasn't interested in anything she
had to say right then and he kissed her instead. He didn't have
time to get lost in her though because Hermione suddenly stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"All
right, let's go," she announced. She pulled on Ron's arm and
swatted Harry on the shoulder. "Hurry up!" Hermione grabbed
Ginny's arm and tugged her onto the bus and Harry followed swiftly,
not wishing to incur Hermione's wrath. They settled down in their
seats and Ernie took off, leaving a cloud of dust in their wake.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
miss home," said Ron suddenly. "I mean it's great here but
reading that in the paper … I miss home, y'know?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
nodded and held his hand out for the paper. Opening it he turned to
the page with the picture of Teddy on it. Staring at the picture of
the baby he reached out a finger to trace the outline of his little
face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you miss Teddy?" asked Ginny softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
until just now," replied Harry softly. "I want to go home … and
see Teddy."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
want to go and get my Hogwarts letter," said Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
get what we came for, and then you can go home," said Bill smiling.
It seemed they had not been on the Roobus for more than a few minutes
when Ernie brought it to a screeching halt in the middle of a wide
street lined with shops.</p><p class="calibre8">"Welcome
to beautiful downtown Yackandandah," said Jonathon with a grin.
Harry and Ginny clambered off the bus, followed closely by the rest
of the family and stood looking around at the small town.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I guess we'd better find somewhere to stay," said Hermione,
sounding a little unsure. Jonathon, who was standing next to her,
reached out to put a hand on her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll
be all right, Hermione," he said. "There's bound to be a Bed
and Breakfast here somewhere and you'll find your parents and be
able to take them home before you know it. Give us a yell when you've
sorted it out and we'll come and get youse." Hermione smiled at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
for everything," she said, the others echoing her. "It's been
an adventure."</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay,
well, not too many more then," said Bert as she climbed back onto
the Roobus. "Time to get back to your own life I reckon." Harry
watched as the bus took off, Bert and Jonathon hanging from the back,
waving madly and thought that it was high time he got back to his
life and he couldn't wait.</p><p class="calibre8">***************************</p><p class="calibre8">Finding
a place to stay wasn't difficult. It might have been peak tourist
season in the middle of nowhere but seasons were different further
south and north eastern Victoria was pretty chilly. There was plenty
of room at a cosy Bed and Breakfast on the main street and the
proprietor happily shared with them all she knew about the town's
new dentists. They had a small practice a few doors down the street
and were a very nice couple. Harry could see Hermione itching to bolt
out the door while the old lady who ran the establishment blathered
on and on about nothing relevant that he could discern.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yes and she makes the most wonderful scones, Dr Wilkins. You really
must try some of Mavis's though, hers are better, more buttery,"
said the old lady, who's name was Doris. "I put sponges in the
show myself. Nothing beats a good sponge. You will be here for
afternoon tea, won't you? I expect you'd like to sample some of
my sponge. It's award winning you know. Of course I can get some of
Mavis's scones if you'd really like to try them. You'll see,
you won't be able to resist them."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
well we'd best be off for some lunch," said Bill as he edged
towards the door. "Thank you so much and we'll see you back here
later." Doris muttered something cheerfully as she shuffled off in
the direction of what Harry assumed was her formidable kitchen,
designed to produce forty different types of cakes and pastries with
which to lure unsuspecting passers by.</p><p class="calibre8">Once
outside the group decided to split up. Bill and Hermione went alone
to ascertain what, if any, problems they might encounter while the
rest of them went for a walk. Harry and Ginny trailed after George
and Ron as they all ate sandwiches purchased from a small sandwich
shop and took a walk along a hiking trail that they found. Fleur
complained the entire time about the smells, the sounds and the fact
that she was sure some evil little bush creature was watching them.
Afternoon tea back at the Bed and Breakfast with Mavis's scones and
the 'best sponge cake in the district' was a subdued affair as
they waited for Hermione and Bill to return.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
was smiling when they did return and revealed that they had met with
her parents as representatives regarding their inheritance and Bill
discovered that the charm on them would be fairly easy to reverse but
might take some time and concentration so it had best wait until an
appointment they had set up for the next day. George suggested that
they celebrate Ginny's coming of age in style at the local pub. The
birthday celebrations went off without a hitch despite stale cake and
Ron's fascination with the television over the bar, but the next
morning wasn't as successful.</p><p class="calibre8">It
had started out well enough; Hermione had greeted her parents and
politely explained she was there about there about the inheritance
matter. The rest of them were supposed to wait down the street.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
really didn't think it was Ron's fault that he managed to get
stung by a Billywig and levitated down the road right in front of
Hermione's unobliviated parents.</p><p class="calibre8">Nor
was it George's fault that he actually felled the gum tree in which
Ron had anchored himself. Anyone can make a simple mistake with spell
pronunciation.</p><p class="calibre8">It
certainly wasn't Ginny's fault that the spell she cast to cushion
the impact conjured an incredibly large purple cushion in the front
yard of the dental surgery, that could happen to anyone.</p><p class="calibre8">It
definitely wasn't Harry's fault that he didn't know how to deal
with the Aurors sent by the Australian Ministry to sort out the
problem who were young, female and rather taken with him. Anyone
could have understood Ginny's pressing need to send a <em class="calibre9">Densaugeo
</em>hex
their way.</p><p class="calibre8">By
the time a Healer had been summoned to fix the teeth, a team of
wizards had Obliviated all the Muggles who had seen the giant purple
cushion and a witch with expertise in fixing magical accidents had
put the gum tree back it was mid afternoon.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione's
parents had barricaded themselves in their surgery. Hermione was
reluctant to frighten them any further by breaking in using magic and
Ron was still floating six feet above the ground, now surrounded by
several charms to make him completely unnoticeable by the Muggles.
Hermione was sitting dispiritedly on the low stone wall in front of
her parent's surgery and three Ministry wizards were filling out
paperwork in triplicate on clipboards.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,
let me go and talk to them," said Bill, squatting in front of the
younger witch. He picked up her hands which had been twisting the hem
of her jumper mercilessly. Harry was struck with how tender Bill was
with her. It reminded him of how Bill had calmed him in the early
days following the battle at Hogwarts. Harry realised that this was
how Bill was with all his younger siblings and it meant that he and
Hermione had been taken into the Weasley family wholeheartedly and
not just by Molly and Arthur.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was supposed to be quick and simple and easy," wailed Hermione. "It
wasn't supposed to be a big mess like this!" Harry could see Ron
trying to swim through the air in an effort to get down to Hermione
but he was wholly unsuccessful and gave up, crossing his arms across
his chest and hanging helplessly in mid air. Bill smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
has anything you've done with these two been simple?" he
indicated Ron and Harry. "Don't worry we'll get it sorted out.
Please, let me go and talk to them." Hermione looked at him sadly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
scare them," she said. "They looked really scared."</p><p class="calibre8">She
burst into tears and Harry went to her and pulled her into a hug. He
looked up at Ron as Hermione cried into his chest. The look on Ron's
face was pure frustration and Harry felt utterly helpless. Bill
strode off towards the old house into which the dental surgery had
been built and, unlocking the door with a simple <em class="calibre9">Alohamora</em>
he, entered in the front door, closing it behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
worry 'ermione, 'e weel fix eet," said Fleur as Hermione
straightened up and stared at the door of the house. Harry kept his
arms around her and she made no move to extricate herself, perhaps
she needed the comfort and to his own surprise Harry found himself
quite willing and able to give it. He listened with half an ear to
Ginny and George being questioned rather heavily by some Ministry
wizards over the spells they had managed to completely botch in
spectacular fashion.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
do realise the seriousness of this event, Mr Weasley?" a rather
harassed looking official said gravely. George nodded solemnly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
yes," he assured the Australian wizard. "It was a most
unfortunate incident that will never happen again. I do assure you of
that sir."</p><p class="calibre8">"We
can't have half competent witches and wizards running about the
countryside doing whatever they please to poor unsuspecting Muggles
you know!" said a second official who was wearing a rather odd
combination of a kilt and a leather jacket. Harry thought that the
official was much more likely to make Muggles question things than
George's tree felling spell would.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
no, absolutely not, I quite understand," murmured George, sounding
incredibly sincere. The wizard in the kilt did not notice George slip
something into his pocket as he walked away to finish filling in his
paperwork.</p><p class="calibre8">"Miss
Weasley," simpered a squat witch who reminded Harry uncomfortably
of Umbridge. "You are of age dear, but perhaps you'd best wait
until you get home before attempting any more … magic." The witch
thrust a piece of paper at Ginny and smiling in a very disconcerting
manner, marched off to consult with her colleagues. Bill came back
out of the house as Ginny made a noise of disgust.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not fair," said Ginny. "I just got legal and now I'm not
allowed to do any magic!" She showed Harry the piece of paper she
had been given. It said Ginny was not permitted to perform magic in
Australia except in Origin Alley so she didn't disturb the Muggles.
George leaned over to read it and let out a low whistle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
if you're going to conjure giant purple cushions-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
yes I do that all the time! Honestly if you hadn't felled that
tree-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
so your stupid spell is my fault now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
if the robe fits, George-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
stop it!" bellowed Ron from mid air. "Stop upsetting Hermione!"
He looked fierce and incongruous all at the same time and Harry found
it hard not to laugh. Hermione had begun crying again and Harry
patted her gently on the back while Ginny and George murmured their
apologies. Bill shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
willing to listen to you now," he said to Hermione, holding out his
hand. "Come on." Hermione stood there contemplating Bill's
outstretched hand. Eventually she put her hand in his as if clutching
at a lifeline and followed him inside. Harry watched them go and
stood staring at the closed door. He felt Ginny's hand slip into
his.</p><p class="calibre8">"She'll
be all right, Harry," said Ginny. Harry smiled at her and squeezed
her hand but did not say anything. Bill emerged from the front door a
short time later.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well?"
Harry questioned him. Bill smiled wearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"We've
reversed the charm," he said. "Hermione got stuck but we managed
to fix it. I made my excuses and left them to their reunion." Fleur
got up and threw her arms around her husband.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
you are so clever," she gushed before kissing him soundly. George
groaned and Ginny made a gagging noise. Bill surfaced from the kiss
and glared at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can talk," he grumbled before returning to the kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!"
Ron's disembodied voice floated down. "I'm getting hungry!"</p><p class="calibre8">*****************************</p><p class="calibre8">It
seemed that Ron was particularly susceptible to Billywig stings. Bill
managed to conjure a rope and tow him back to the Bed and Breakfast
where he floated in the corner all night like an overgrown kite.
Hermione stayed the night with her parents, promising to come and see
them all in the morning and Ginny, perhaps not wanting to be alone,
had crept into the boys' room some time during the night and
commandeered Ron's bed. When Harry awoke to the sound of absurdly
loud squawking birds, he could smell her and eyes still half shut, he
padded over to the bed, climbing in and wrapping her in his arms
before falling back asleep. It was to a much louder squawking that he
awoke the second time.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
does he think he's playing at?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
leave them alone!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think you can see that nothing's going on."</p><p class="calibre8">"Deed
'er birthday mean nothing to you? 'E weel look after 'er, non?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
mum would find this information interesting!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
muzzer cannot say anyzing, she ees of age!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't believe you are on her side!"</p><p class="calibre8">"We
are women; we do not take ze side of ze men!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Face
it; she'd be in his bed in a flash. Why can't it go both ways?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
… because … he's supposed to be the noble one!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Would
you four just shut up?" hissed Harry. "You'll wake Ginny if
you're not careful. Besides, between you lot and those ridiculous
birds making that horrible noise, even in the middle of the night, I
haven't had much sleep."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
you're in bed with Ginny!" protested Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
and I'm wearing clothes. You tell her we can't. Be my guest,"
smirked Harry as he snuggled further into the covers. The air was
chilly and the old house clearly did not have central heating. Ginny
sighed in her sleep and snuggled closer to his chest as he closed his
eyes. The truth was he had no intention of sleeping just now but he
wasn't about to let a good opportunity to hold and caress Ginny get
away. He heard the others leave the room, Ron grumbling as he hit his
head on the lintel. He'd still not stopped levitating but at least
he was no longer floating as high. Harry stayed in the bed, holding
Ginny until she woke up. A slow smile spread across her face when she
realised Harry was snuggled next to her drawing patterns on her back
and thigh with his fingertips and she turned her face up to him, an
unspoken question on her face. Harry leaned down to kiss her softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
making it up to you," he said softly and Ginny smiled. The two of
them lay in the bed, feet entwined, bodies pressed against each other
as they kissed each other softly. Ron stomped back into the room a
few minutes later with a strange squishing sound and sat heavily on
Harry's bed.</p><p class="calibre8">Apparently
Ron had stopped levitating rather suddenly and managed to slam into
the table in the dining room and now had a jug of orange juice in his
shoes. He'd kept out of Doris's way and she hadn't seen the
mishap but George had to wear the responsibility of spilling the
juice and breaking her best glass jug because as far as she was
concerned Ron was still in bed and certainly not floating three feet
above her dining room table.</p><p class="calibre8">"At
least I can eat properly now," Ron grumbled as he cleaned and dried
his trainers with his wand. "You've no idea just how hard it is
to grab bacon when you keep bouncing off the ceiling."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
all about food with you, isn't it Ron?" asked Ginny from her
supine position in Harry's arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
everything!" Ron defended. "Are you two going to get up and have
some breakfast or are you trying to get Bill riled up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
his problem?" demanded Ginny sitting up abruptly. Ron shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
dunno, he sounded okay with everything yesterday," he said. "Maybe
he just doesn't like seeing it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Seeing
what?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That,"
muttered Ron waving at them randomly again. "The lovey dovey
stuff." Ginny snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
he can talk," she said snidely. "He used to let Fleur feed him
while she sat on his <em class="calibre9">lap</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
don't you ask him what his problem is, Ginny," said Ron, standing
up. "I don't care what you do, sort it out with Bill." Ginny
turned to Harry as Ron walked towards the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you hear that he doesn't care what we do," she said, smiling
lasciviously. Harry gulped and Ron turned around abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't want to know what you do either," he said, shuddering as he
went out and closed the door behind him. Ginny fell back into the bed
giggling but Harry didn't find it very funny at all. Bill had been
giving him odd looks for days and he didn't know why and now it
seemed as though Bill wasn't as okay with things between him and
Ginny as he'd thought. As much as he didn't want to he decided
he'd better have a talk with Bill. Absently he summoned his glasses
and climbed out of the bed. Ginny caught at his hand as he did so.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
up?" she asked softly. Harry looked down at her and smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing,
just hungry," he said. "I'm going to get dressed and go in for
breakfast." He rummaged in his bag and pulled out some clothes.
Turning around he noticed that Ginny was lying on her side, in the
bed, her head propped up on her hand, watching him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
going to get dressed now."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can't watch!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
not?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
– because … well it's …" Harry trailed off. He had no good
reason why she couldn't watch so he sighed and pulled his pyjama
top over his head and put his t-shirt and jumper on. Next he put his
socks on, putting off the inevitable. When his socks were the
straightest they had ever been, meticulously adjusted inch by inch he
eyed his boxers and jeans warily. There was nothing for it; he would
have to just do it. Sighing and blushing furiously, his hands went to
the waistband of his pyjama pants and he was about to pull them off
when Ginny leapt from the bed and headed for the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
see you at breakfast," she squeaked at him before she scuttled out
the door and closed it behind her with a loud click. Harry laughed,
realising he had called her bluff. As he headed to the dining room
for breakfast his thoughts soon turned to Bill as he wondered what
the other man was thinking. If
you'd asked Harry a few days ago if Bill approved of him going out
with Ginny he'd have thought Bill did but now it seemed to be the
opposite. Thoughts
were swirling through his head as he sat down at the dining table,
nodding good morning absently. He ate mechanically and only
acknowledged Ginny briefly when she sat down next to him a few
minutes later. By the end of breakfast Harry was none the wiser about
Bill and had no clear idea about how to approach him.</p><p class="calibre8">***********************</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
and her parents came to the Bed and Breakfast later that morning
while Ron was complaining over a Muggle chess set in Doris's
spacious living room. He had been unable to beat either Ginny or
George who were now engrossed in a ridiculous cooking show on the
television in the corner. Bill and Fleur had gone for a walk and
returned with red noses and freezing finger tips. They now stood
huddled in front of the fire that Harry had been staring into for the
better part of an hour. It was cold in country Victoria and Doris
favoured a real fire during winter. Harry was glad. It felt familiar
to stare into the flickering flames and think. Ginny was tucked up at
his side and he had one arm draped around her, idly playing with the
ends of her hair. Harry didn't look up when Hermione entered; he
was too busy thinking about what it would be like to be home and in
familiar surroundings again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
everything's settled," Hermione's voice broke though his
thoughts and Harry looked up to see Hermione and her parents standing
in the middle of the room. "We went to find a cocky this morning
and sent it to Bert and Ernie. Mum and Dad are as anxious to get home
as we all are now that they remember who they are. Hopefully the
Roobus will pick us up sometime on Friday."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked at Mr and Mrs Granger who looked more tanned and more relaxed
than he had seen them before. He listened with half an ear to their
account of the past year and Hermione's explanations that they'd
have to find a new place to live once they got home but it was clear
now that their memories had been restored Hermione's parents were
very eager to get back home.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
I'm going to help pack," said Hermione after a brief lull in the
conversation. "Er, does anyone want to come and help?" Ron
volunteered immediately and Fleur agreed shortly afterwards. Harry
said nothing as George and Ginny agreed to come as well.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?"
Ginny asked expectantly. "Are you going to come?" Before Harry
could answer, Bill spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think Harry and I should do the packing here."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked up at Bill, startled but the older man only smiled at him so
he nodded. Ginny looked between the two of them before kissing Harry
softly on the cheek and following Hermione out the door. Harry
started to get up immediately but Bill put out a hand to stop him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,
can we talk?" Bill asked quietly. Harry nodded, unsure what this
meant. He sat uneasily in his seat, watching the fire and waited for
Bill to speak.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fleur
told me that Ginny's in love with you," he said eventually. Harry
looked up at Bill who was standing and staring out of the window. "I
knew she had a crush on you but I had no idea that she was so …
serious about you. I want to think you are as serious about her but
I'm just not sure." Harry watched Bill as he pushed his hands
into his pockets and turned around to face Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
Tuesday-" started Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was her birthday, I said what she wanted to hear," said Bill
roughly. "I was surprised when you and George and Ron seemed to all
be on the same page. So I spoke to George last night. He said you're
in love with her." Harry only nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"For
how long?" asked Bill abruptly, "six months, a year?" Harry
looked Bill directly in the eye.</p><p class="calibre8">"Forever,"
he said. Bill held his gaze for what felt like hours.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
my baby sister," said the older man quietly. "Watching
you two lately … how serious it all seems … how quickly it's
all moving.
I used to tell her stories you know, stories about you, when she was
little. She used to tell me she was going to marry you one day. But
it was kid stuff, a little girl's dreams. I watched her talking to
you about getting married. I couldn't bear for her dreams to be
shattered when you've decided you've had enough."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
sat silently watching the flames. He didn't know how to convince
Bill that he wasn't playing with Ginny's feelings.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron
and George trust you," said Bill suddenly. "That's good enough
for me."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked up. He could see that Bill wasn't telling the whole truth.
It was nearly good enough, but not quite. Harry was entirely unsure
how to convince Bill but things seemed less strained between them now
and they worked together mostly in silence to pack up the belongings
that had been scattered during their brief stay.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
received a cocky from Bert late that night saying that Ernie and
Jonathon would pick them up the following afternoon, which was
Friday, and enclosed a piece of parchment inviting all of them to The
Dripping Bucket on Saturday afternoon for the wedding. Hermione sent
back their acceptance and a Portkey booking for Sunday. Bill and
Fleur having decided they'd squashed quite enough adventure into
their trip and that they'd spend the remainder of their honeymoon
at home in their own little cottage, were going to accompany the
others home. It was with a sense of relief that the little group
retired that night, they'd be going home soon and there really was
no place like home.</p>
