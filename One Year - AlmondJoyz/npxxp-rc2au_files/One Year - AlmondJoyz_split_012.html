<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_13">*Chapter 12*: July</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong><br class="calibre6"/>
Chapter Twelve:<br class="calibre6"/>
<em class="calibre8">July</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny opened her eyes to the
bright sunlight that streamed into her room, temporarily blinding
her. Looking up at the ceiling, she stretched her arms above her head
and smiled broadly, happy to be home once again. It was strange,
somehow, knowing that she would never have to share a room with five
other girls, or have to eat at scheduled times anymore. She was
finished with her education at Hogwarts. She was in love. Life
couldn't get much better.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">She rolled onto her stomach and
noticed that Hedwig had once again taken roost on her bureau. The
bird gave her a quiet hoot and flew over to the bed, landing softly
on Ginny's shoulder.</p><p class="calibre9">"Morning, Hedwig,"
she whispered as she untied the note from the owl's leg. Hedwig
hooted again and fluttered out the open window.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Morning Gin</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I can't wait to see you. I
finish up with my last class at eleven, and I'll Apparate right over.<br class="calibre6"/>
Your mum said I could spend the
month there until training starts up again, so we'll have the whole
time together.<br class="calibre6"/>
Hermione has your room ready
for you to move into; so whenever you're all situated I'll help you
get your things over there.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">See you in a few hours,<br class="calibre6"/>
Harry</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>With a broad smile, she added the
letter to the collection that now filled the drawer of her bedside
table to the brim. She would never throw these letters away and knew
that she would read them over and over again in the future.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">She swung her legs out of bed and
grabbed her dressing gown, settling her feet on the cold wooden floor
of her bedroom.</p><p class="calibre9">Her bedroom. It was the only
room that she truly felt was her own, even though she loved her dorm
at Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre9">But soon, she would be leaving
forever.</p><p class="calibre9">Well, not exactly forever, she
knew that, of course. But her address would change in a matter of
weeks, bringing about a certain sense of nostalgia that was rather
persistent.</p><p class="calibre9">She remembered how Bill had
helped her learn to play Exploding Snap when she was five. She only
cried once when the cards exploded and after that, with Bill at her
side, she'd proven to be a wicked player.</p><p class="calibre9">She smiled as she recalled how
Charlie would sit and draw dragons with her for hours, describing
them in vivid detail even before he started Hogwarts. It was evident,
even then, that he would follow his passion.</p><p class="calibre9">She giggled at how Percy tried
to teach her how to write letters and numbers when she was three. He
was a patient teacher and by the time she was five, she was able to
write a neat manuscript and began writing cursive.</p><p class="calibre9">Fred and George, of course, took her
under their wing and taught her how to be devious and take care of
herself. They never tried to protect her the way the others did, and
for that, she would always be grateful.</p><p class="calibre9">Ron was more than a brother. He
was her friend, and for the first ten years of her life he was also
her confidant and protector. In a way, she was glad that she would
still see him often, given the fact that they were each dating
flatmates.</p><p class="calibre9">Her parents would have the
hardest time letting her go, especially her mother. Ginny knew that
she was the surprise of the family, and the fact that she was female
made her parents want to protect her even more. While their
protectiveness was irritating at best, she always knew that they
loved her. She was encouraged to keep up with her brothers and not
let them leave her out of things. Ginny had to admit that they did a
wonderful job raising her to be the witch she was today.</p><p class="calibre9">A soft knock at the door tore
her from her thoughts. Ginny looked up to find her mother standing in
the door carrying a tray with a teapot and the French press Bill and
Fleur had given Ginny for Christmas.</p><p class="calibre9">"Do you mind if we
breakfast here together?" her mother asked. "Your father
had to leave for the office early today." She set the tray on
the bedside table and pulled the desk chair over.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh that'd be great, Mum,"
Ginny answered with a smile. She sat back down on the bed and took
the coffee mug handed to her.</p><p class="calibre9">Her nostrils filled with the
aroma of the steaming liquid, and she smiled as she brought it to her
lips.</p><p class="calibre9">"Did I make it right?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Mmm-hmm. I missed this at
school. The house elves are great and all, but they can't make a
cup of coffee to save their lives" Ginny chirped. It was true.
Try as they may, the house elves messed up the coffee every time she
tried to get some. Dobby and Winky hit themselves over the head
numerous times and finally, Ginny just gave up trying to find good
coffee at Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny and her mother chuckled at her
remark and each drank their beverage in companionable silence.</p><p class="calibre9">"Now, I know you didn't
just come up here to drink coffee with me, Mum. What's going on?"
Ginny set her cup on the bedside table and looked at her mother
expectantly.</p><p class="calibre9">With a heavy sigh, her mother
placed her tea on the desk. "Fine. I don't think you should move
to London."</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum, we've talked about this,"
Ginny told her.</p><p class="calibre9">"No, you informed us in letters
that you had already made up your mind." Her mother gave her a
rather stern look that told Ginny that she was serious. "I don't
like the idea of you out there on your own."</p><p class="calibre9">"But I won't BE alone,
Mother. I'm going to be living with Hermione!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Do you know that she and Ron
are usually at her flat? Will you stay there when Ron stays over?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Er, well, I thought-"</p><p class="calibre9">"You will not be spending the
night with Harry, my dear."</p><p class="calibre9">After their talk about this
same subject back in January, Ginny couldn't believe that her mother
was still harping about this. She'd told her that she and Harry had
not slept together, and Ginny assumed that her mother believed her.
Apparently, it only lasted while she attended Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre9">"We haven't even done
that, Mum," Ginny pointed out. "We talked about this
before, and I thought you trusted me."</p><p class="calibre9">"I do. But you'll be in
the same city and seeing each other more often and I'd just be more
comfortable with you here, at The Burrow, that's all."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny watched as her mother rose from
her chair and began picking dirty clothes up off the floor.</p><p class="calibre9">"I don't believe you! You
honestly have no faith in either one of us?" Ginny stared as her
mother continued to straighten up the room. "Mum, look at me!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginevra, dear, I trust
you. But I also know what runs through the minds of eighteen-year-old
young men living on their own." Ginny's jaw dropped. "They
get it in their heads that sex is the be all and end all of a
relationship. I don't want to see either you or Harry make a
mistake."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny sprang from her bed.
"Mother! I am not a child anymore. Please trust me!" She
knelt on the floor in front of her mother and took her hands in her
own. "Mum, I've always had people looking after me. Between you
and Dad and the boys, I've never been on my own. Even at Hogwarts
there was always someone there to keep an eye on me." She
paused, thinking back to the poor example that was her first year.
With a deep breath, she continued, "I can handle it. I'm strong,
and I'm smart. I need to do this for myself, I really do." Ginny
locked eyes with her mother, noticing the tears beginning to well in
her eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny felt her mother's hand on
her cheek gently stroking the fullness of her cheek with her thumb.
"But remember, you'll always have a home here if things don't
work out, alright?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Serious?" She couldn't
believe her mother was agreeing with her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes, but don't keep
pestering me, or I may just change my mind," her mother teased.
"You're right. You've never really been on your own, and it
would be more conducive to your training at St. Mungo's. Please be
careful, love," she whispered huskily as tears began forming in
her eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">"I will," she
promised as her own tears began dripping down her cheeks. "I'll
come home for Christmas and some weekends, I swear." She smiled
weakly at her and found herself pulled into a Molly Weasley hug.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny stood outside The Burrow,
anxiously awaiting Harry's arrival. According to his letter, he
finished class at eleven that morning and was due to arrive any
minute. Checking her watch again, she saw that it was fifteen minutes
to twelve, and she was getting nervous. She kept telling herself that
he wouldn't pull another stunt and not come today. She turned around
to head back inside the house but before she got very far, a familiar
crack caused her to turn on her heel.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Harry!" She ran
toward where he stood and flung herself at him, wrapping her arms and
legs around him and meeting his lips in a crushing kiss.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry stumbled as she slammed into
him and held on tight, returning her kisses until he couldn't breathe
anymore.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi," he said, in
dazed sort of voice. Harry set her on the grass and took her hand in
his. "I hear you nearly beat Hermione's marks."</p><p class="calibre9">"Not quite, but close enough,"
she stated proudly. "You're late. I'd thought you'd be here
sooner."</p><p class="calibre9">"Did you want me all stinky and
sweaty from combat training?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh, yes," she teased
while she ran a hand through his hair. "I always liked looking
at you after Quidditch, all manly and rugged. It's sexy." His
eyes locked on hers as she spoke, and Ginny couldn't get over the
look of raw desire she saw in his eyes. "Er, um, Mum's held
lunch till you got here." She looked away and pulled Harry
toward the house.</p><p class="calibre9">Once inside the kitchen of The
Burrow, Ginny felt herself relax a bit more. Being around Harry these
next few weeks was surely going to test her resolve, but she wanted
to prove to her parents that she had her hormones under control.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry, m'boy! Good to see
you!" Ginny's father stood up, shook hands with Harry, and
pulled him in for a quick man-hug. It was adorable the way her father
had tried to teach Harry how to accept affection over the years. She
had to admit that Harry'd come a long way from the shy, stand-offish
boy that first walked through those doors seven years ago.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank you, Mr. Weasley."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny shook her head at Harry's
remark. Her parents had been after him for a while now to call them
by their given names but no matter how hard he tried, he maintained a
formality that reflected his lonely and detached childhood. She
silently hoped that some day, he would get past that and allow
himself to truly become part of their family.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry, my don't you look
fit!"</p><p class="calibre9">Her mother had entered the
kitchen and for once didn't chastise him for being thin and not
eating enough. She went over to Harry, pulled him into an embrace,
and kissed him on the cheek.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum, I think Ginny's
supposed to notice that, not you," added George who sauntered in
after his mother. "I do have to say, though, Potter, that you
are no longer the scrawny kid I remember."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry looked down at the floor
sheepishly, and Ginny took the opportunity to give Harry a good once
over. What she finally noticed, took her by surprise.</p><p class="calibre9">Without her realising, Harry'd
grown about three inches, now standing nearly a head taller than her.
His face took on the look of a man now that he had matured, and if
she wasn't' mistaken, he'd forgotten to shave that morning and had
a day's growth on his face. His shoulders were broader, and she knew
that his abdomen had to be more defined than back in November. His
arms were more muscular, and she longed to have them wrapped around
her again. She quickly closed her eyes and tried to rid herself of
the image she'd just conjured.</p><p class="calibre9">In short, Harry looked even more
luscious than before.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny and Harry spent most of
their days relaxing by the pond and watching the garden gnomes
traipse across the garden. They would often have their lunch out
there, under a wide willow tree, and enjoy the quiet of the day and
their time with one another.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ron wasn't staying at The
Burrow for the summer. Puddlemere was in the playoffs and Ron had to
stay at the house the team had rented for daily training. The match
was set for the following week, and it would be the first time that
Ron and Hermione would be together since she'd left for Portugal.
Ginny had teased Harry that their reunion would be spent in Ron's
room, and Harry would end up playing house-elf.</p><p class="calibre9">"So, Ginny," Harry
mused while he played with her hair and wrapped it around one of his
fingers. "You wanna go fly?" He asked her this every day,
and the answer was always the same.</p><p class="calibre9">"Not today, Harry."
Ginny would never admit it to him, but she was dead frightened to get
back on her broom since the accident that had left her with a
concussion and temporary hearing loss. She snuggled back into his
lap, hoping that he'd change the subject and not push it any more.</p><p class="calibre9">"But Ginny, it's been almost two
months since you've been on your broom. You need to get back up
there," he begged.</p><p class="calibre9">She knew he really wanted to go
flying with her; she caught him cleaning her broom and fixing the
twigs more than once, and each time she told him not to bother. She
knew Harry was right, and that getting back on the broom would do her
more good than anything. But she also couldn't shake the sense of
trepidation that came over her whenever she thought about it.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't you think I know that?"
She sat up and looked at him with what she hoped was a fierce look in
her eyes. "I was hit in the head with a Bludger and lost my
hearing for hours at a time, Harry. I'm scared." There, she'd
finally admitted it. She was scared to fly.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry pulled her into his arms
and stroked her hair while she let tears escape her. Flying was
always the one thing that made her forget her troubles and brought
her more happiness than anything else. She hated being afraid of
flying, and wanted to go with him, she really did.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, how many times
have I got hurt while flying? I broke my arm second year. I fell off
after a Dementor tried to kiss me up in the sky. I got hit constantly
with Bludgers in practise just because I was too busy looking at
you." He took a breath, and put a finger to her mouth to keep
her from answering. "Even after Umbridge forced me off the team,
I never let her win. Flying is a part of me, just like it's a part of
you. I want to take you flying, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">He stood up with a determined look on
his face, holding out his hand in invitation for her to take it. His
eyes held a determined look and she was torn between going and
holding her ground.</p><p class="calibre9">"I don't know, Harry…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, there's nothing to be
frightened of. I'll be right there with you. No Bludgers, I promise,"
he pleaded.</p><p class="calibre9">"I…I can't explain it,
but I don't think I can," she told him and hung her head,
looking to the ground.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're stronger than
that, and you know it! You need to get back up on that broom. The
longer you wait, the harder it will be." He sounded irritated
and frustrated. When she just stared at him, saying nothing, Harry
huffed, "You're going!"</p><p class="calibre9">He grabbed her hand and pulled
her up to him. Before she could find her wand, he pulled it out of
her pocket and banished it to Merlin knew where.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry! Give me my wand back!"
she screamed at him.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Accio</em> <em class="calibre8">Firebolt</em>!"</p><p class="calibre9">With a whoosh, Ginny saw
Harry's broom zooming towards them and then hover above the ground.
Despite the added weight of her body, Harry slid them both onto the
broom, holding Ginny in front of him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry! Put me down!"</p><p class="calibre9">Before she could wiggle off the
broom, he kicked off and they were soon up above The Burrow, zooming
over the orchard and toward the paddock. Ginny closed her eyes tight
and held onto Harry's arms, which were around her waist, even
tighter. She felt him slow the broom down as they descended a bit.</p><p class="calibre9">"Shh, Ginny it's okay. I'm
here," he whispered into her neck, his breath making her shiver.
"Open your eyes. You love flying almost as much as you love me,
remember?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny let out a snort of
laughter and opened her eyes. They were circling the pond behind her
house, and she noticed that the lily pads were in bloom. Their soft,
delicate pink flowers were a strong contrast to the murky green of
the pond. Harry pointed the broom downward, and she felt her bare
toes skim across the cool water. He lowered the broom so that their
feet were dragging in the water as he leaned down to pluck a flower
from one of the lily pads. They ascended again, and he placed the
flower behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are you okay, Gin?" he
whispered before dragging his lips down her neck, stopping at her
collarbone and sending another shiver down her spine.</p><p class="calibre9">Sitting there on Harry's broom,
with his arms around her, she never felt safer. She sighed and
savoured the feel of being held by him. She was more than fine. This
is where she wanted to stay.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin?" He reached
around and turned her face toward his and gave her a light kiss on
the lips. "Is this okay? We can land if you want."</p><p class="calibre9">"It's fine, Harry. I'm
okay." She kissed him this time, letting him know that what he
did for her was just what she'd needed.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The third Saturday of July was
Ron's final Quidditch match of the season, and as it happened, it was
the English League Championship Match: Puddlemere versus Wimbourne.
Wimbourne was favoured to win the championship, and the week prior to
the match was very reminiscent of the World Cup five years ago, with
the twins making bets with anyone that mentioned Quidditch.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Harry was in for ten Galleons
for a Puddlemere victory, while Ginny put twelve Sickles on
Wimbourne. It wasn't that she didn't believe in her brother, but she
knew that Ron was overly anxious about the whole thing and his nerves
made him insecure and that meant losing. Even though he had a good
season, big matches were some of his worst performances.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry, don't forget the
Omnioculars! Ron wasn't able to get us very good seats, remember?"
Ginny shouted over her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre9">"Got 'em!" Harry
dashed from the house and ran to catch up with Ginny and the rest of
her family. "I don't know why he wouldn't let me get the
tickets. I could have got us in a lot better section," Harry
mumbled.</p><p class="calibre9">For all she loved him, Ginny
couldn't understand his obsession with the sport. She didn't need the
best seats in the stadium to watch a match; the experience was the
most important thing in her opinion. Besides, everyone would expect
Harry Potter to sit in the Top Box. If he wanted to 'hide' from
people, the cheap seats were the best place. As an added assurance
that he wouldn't be noticed, Harry donned his Yankee cap, which he
wore to The Three Broomsticks in November, and a pair of sunglasses.
Ginny shook her head at him. <em class="calibre8">Yeah, all wizards wear that.</em></p><p class="calibre9">Once outside the boundary wards
of The Burrow, the group Apparated, one after another, to the stadium
outside of Manchester. The crowd, while not as large as that from the
'94 World Cup, was just as noisy. Ginny had a difficult time hearing
the security wizard's instructions and had to step aside to have her
rucksack inspected. Unfortunately, the guard confiscated her stash of
Every Flavour Beans and the bottles of Coca-Cola that she'd brought
along. With a stern warning to remember that "No outside food or
beverage is to be brought into the stadium," Ginny was finally
able to rejoin her family.</p><p class="calibre9">"I told you to leave that
stuff at home," George teased her. "I thought you were a
smart witch, Ginevra." He gave her a sly look, and she knew he
was up to something.</p><p class="calibre9">"Apparently," Fred
chimed in, "our dear sister has forgotten who we are."</p><p class="calibre9">"And that we are masters of
sneakitude." Fred and George grinned widely at each other while
they walked alongside Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sneakitude? You just made
up that word, didn't you?" Ginny said in an irritated tone.</p><p class="calibre9">The twins stopped and turned
out their pockets to reveal what looked like four miniature bottles
of Muggle fizzy drinks. "When you get thirsty during the match,
take one of these and say '<em class="calibre8">Engorgio</em>'. They'll go back to their
original size," instructed Fred, shoving two of the small
bottles into Ginny's pockets. "Enjoy!"</p><p class="calibre9">The match was fabulous, and
Ginny couldn't believe that it lasted nearly six hours. The Chasers
on both teams were more skilled than any she'd ever seen. The
Puddlemere Chasers flew seamlessly, something that amazed and
astonished her in much the same way when she saw Angelina, Katie, and
Alicia fly and worked together back at Hogwarts. And the Beaters were
ruthless. Even though she still cringed whenever the Bludgers zoomed
too close to any of the players, she marvelled at the accuracy
achieved. The Seekers, however, were rubbish. Both she and Harry, on
a number of occasions found the Snitch before either professional
player did. They both agreed that had one or both Seekers been any
better, the match would have ended quicker than it did.</p><p class="calibre9">Ron, much to Ginny's delight and
chagrin, was flawless. He had got so confident on his broom over the
past year that he didn't need to hang onto the broom handle whenever
the opposing Chasers flew his way, and used it to his advantage
mercilessly. The other Keeper, while not as skilled on the broom as
Ron, was also a tremendous player and neither team allowed in many
goals. In fact, before the Snitch was caught, the score was an
impressive 60-70, in favour of Wimbourne. But it was Julian Whitmore,
the Puddlemere Seeker, who finally ended the game after a daring
catch while flying in reverse.</p><p class="calibre9">The Weasleys exploded in
screams as they watched the team circle the stadium in a victory lap,
arms punching the sky in victory. Ginny watched excitedly as the team
made their way to the centre of the pitch, where the award
presentation was to be held. Ginny felt a tug on her arm and turned
to find Harry trying to lead her away.</p><p class="calibre9">"Come on! We get to go
onto the pitch!" His voice was drowned out by the shouts from
the crowd.</p><p class="calibre9">She followed him eagerly and
held his hand tightly, trying to avoid getting separated by the mob
that was surrounding her. They ran down the three flights of stairs
and before they could catch their breath, the entire Weasley family
was whisked away by team officials and brought out onto the pitch
where they were greeted by the families of the other players, all
anxiously waiting to be joined by the tired members of Puddlemere
United.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!" came a shout
from behind her, causing both her and Harry to turn around.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hermione!"</p><p class="calibre9">The three of them held one another in
a massive hug and tried to speak at the same time before Hermione put
her hands over both Harry and Ginny's mouths.</p><p class="calibre9">"Where's Ron? I miss him!"
she pleaded. Ginny could tell that she was anxious to see Ron. After
all, they had been apart for nearly two months. She had only just
arrived a few hours ago, and had watched the remainder of the match
from the lower bleachers.</p><p class="calibre9">"We haven't seen him yet,"
Harry told her. "We're waiting for the team." Harry put one
of his arms around Ginny's waist and the other around Hermione's
shoulder.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ladies and gentlemen!"
a voice from the centre of the pitch boomed, calming everyone down.
"I am honoured to present the championship trophy to the captain
of Puddlemere United, Seth Condon!"</p><p class="calibre9">The crowd cheered as the
sandy-haired captain climbed the stairs to the newly-conjured stage
area and shook hands with Joseph Dolan, head of the Department of
Magical Games, a tall wizard that Ginny recognised from some of Ron's
Quidditch matches.</p><p class="calibre9">Seth Condon held the trophy
aloft in the air for all to see amidst chants of "Champions!
Champions!" At his behest, the rest of the team joined him on
the platform and there was another throng of cheers.</p><p class="calibre9">"Here to present the award
for Player of the Match is none other than world-renown Seeker,
Viktor Krum!" the disembodied voice boomed.</p><p class="calibre9">Ron, Ginny noticed, tensed as
Viktor climbed the stairs. She had a feeling that Ron was trying
desperately to ignore the fact that Hermione returned the same day
Viktor showed up at the Quidditch Pitch.</p><p class="calibre9">The years, unfortunately, were not
kind to Viktor Krum. Ginny knew that he was injured during the war
and now walked with a noticeable limp. His face looked haggard and
his ever-present scowl was even more noticeable. He looked even more
grumpy than usual.</p><p class="calibre9">"Qvidditch is the one
thing dat brings Vizarding Vorld together, in good times as vell as
in bad. I pleased to announce dat the Player of the Match is Charlene
Bellamy!"</p><p class="calibre9">The female Chaser's hands went
to her mouth as she stepped forward to receive the plaque from
Viktor. Flash bulbs went off around the platform for team photos and
individual ones with the trophy.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny beamed with pride as she took
in the momentous occasion before her. There had been only one female
Player of the Match before, and that was Gwenog Jones. Charlene
played a wonderful game and scored all but one of Puddlemere's
goals. In fact, Ginny speculated that Charlene was the lead candidate
for Player of the Year.</p><p class="calibre9">Charlene, Ron and the rest of
the team gathered for numerous photographs. Ron, she noticed, kept
scanning the crowd, no doubt looking for Hermione. A wide smile
spread across his face as his eyes stopped toward the area around
Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">At that, Ron leapt off the
stage and strode across the grass while the crowd parted for him
until he stopped right in front of Hermione. With a look of lust and
sheer joy, he swept Hermione up into his arms and swung her around,
kissing her deeply before walking away from the crowd with Hermione
still in his arms, legs wrapped around his waist.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"What do you want for your
birthday?" Ginny asked Harry.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">It was a cool afternoon, a few
days before Harry's birthday, and Ginny had Apparated to London for a
dinner date with Ron and Hermione. She sat cuddled up with Harry on a
comfortable sofa in his sitting room, waiting for Ron and Hermione to
arrive. The two of them hadn't had much time together since the
Quidditch match.</p><p class="calibre9">"I guess I hadn't really
thought about it," Harry answered, his mouth up against her ear.
The combination of his arms around her and his breath on her skin
made her heart skip a beat. She knew what he was doing, and she was
happy to oblige.</p><p class="calibre9">She turned her head towards him
and Harry's lips claimed hers in a deep, languorous kiss that sent
tingles through her body. His tongue entered her mouth and set about
on its task of teasing her own tongue into following his lead. She
gladly gave in, and settled into his arms as he pulled her across his
chest.</p><p class="calibre9">His hands went to her hair and
gently caressed her scalp, relaxing her even more and turning her
knees to jelly. His mouth left hers and began blazing a trail of hot
kisses along her jaw line and down toward her neck and collarbone.
She let out a groan as his hands left her hair and travelled down her
arms before softly touching her waist and easing his fingers inside
her shirt.</p><p class="calibre9">"You feel so good, Ginny,"
he moaned. Harry began kissing the skin of her shoulder and stroking
the underside of her breast with eager fingers.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh," she eked out,
and her own hands pulled Harry's shirt from his trousers and found
entrance to run her fingers through the soft hair of his torso and
chest. She hastily went to work unbuttoning his crisp oxford shirt,
and fought the urge to drag it off his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre9">Their kisses grew frantic, just
like their hands, and soon Ginny was breathless, lying underneath
him, his thigh between her legs while she rubbed against him trying
to satisfy a need that roared in her ears. She had long lost the
cardigan sweater she was wearing, leaving her only with a light
shell, which was now hiked up around her armpits. Harry was in a
similar state of dishevelment with his shirt open and half-way down
his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin…" Harry's
voice came from deep in his throat, and she knew what he was asking.
"Please…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes," she whispered and
pulled on his earlobe with her teeth, making him groan again. It was
the sexiest sound she'd ever heard.</p><p class="calibre9">"Wha-what?" Harry's head
emerged from between her breasts, his glasses askew on his face and
his lips puffy. He'd never looked hotter. "Did, did you say…"</p><p class="calibre9">CRACK!</p><p class="calibre9">The unmistakable sound of
Apparition drove all sexual thoughts out of Ginny's head, and she and
Harry were greeted with Ron's horrified look and Hermione's highly
embarrassed expression.</p><p class="calibre9">"Shit, Ron!" Harry sat up
and tried to concentrate on redoing his buttons and shielding Ginny
from her brother's eyes. "Don't you knock?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You're in the blasted
sitting room, Harry!" Ron bent over and tossed Ginny her
sweater. "You knew we'd be here." Ron stormed out of the
room and headed toward the entry hall, swearing to himself along the
way.</p><p class="calibre9">"Come on, Ginny. Let's fix
your hair," Hermione urged. Ginny followed her up the stairs and
gave Harry one last wistful look.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>With much negotiating, Harry
convinced Ginny's mother to have his birthday party at his house
rather than at The Burrow. He kept reminding her that his classes
started again on the first and he didn't want to have to be up too
late. Ginny was amazed at how well Harry had developed his own puppy
dog look; more surprising was that it actually worked on her mother.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny stood in the back garden, one
hand clasped in Harry's and the other holding a bottle of Butterbeer.
They were chatting with a now very pregnant Tonks and a very
over-protective Remus.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are you sure you're fine
to stand, Dora? You hadn't been feeling well earlier," Remus
asked her after she groaned and put a hand to her back. Ginny smiled
as she watched Remus caress the small of his wife's back.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm fine, Moony," Tonks
answered in a harsh tone, which was quite out of character for her.
"It's just a backache!" She was getting downright snippy
now.</p><p class="calibre9">"We should go. You look so
tired," Remus pleaded with his wife. "You've been
complaining about your back all day." Ginny couldn't help but
notice the look of concern on his face. Perhaps there was something
wrong with her.</p><p class="calibre9">"You do, Tonks," Ginny
added, placing a hand on her friends shoulder. "Go, sit down."</p><p class="calibre9">"I don't bloody well want to sit
down! I have a fucking backache that's all!" Tonks shouted,
turning heads and causing several curious looks.</p><p class="calibre9">"Dora!" Remus hissed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Tonks, dear, are you alright?"
Ginny's mother walked next to Tonks and began stroking her back. "Is
anything wrong?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I don't kn…OW!"
Tonks winced and doubled-over, making Remus lurch forward and put his
arms around her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre9">Before Ginny could get to Tonks'
side, Amanda and Fleur were there alongside Ginny's mother. Was it
time?</p><p class="calibre9">"Tonks? Is…is it
the…baby?" Harry's face had gone pale, and he looked utterly
sick. Ginny had to stifle a giggle as he began to back away.</p><p class="calibre9">After that, it was a mad blur
of activity. The women rushed Tonks inside to the study and began
ordering the men around. Ginny tagged along out of curiosity, both
medical and personal. She'd never seen a baby born and it fascinated
her.</p><p class="calibre9">Tonks, for all her added weight
and new centre of gravity, managed to fight off the arms of the women
that surrounded her, knocking Fleur to the floor.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Sacre bleu</em>! 'ow
dare you throw me to zee floor!" Fleur screamed at Tonks. "Ze
bebe…" Her hands flew to her face and she blushed furiously.</p><p class="calibre9">The room went suddenly quiet as the
women as well as Remus and Ginny's father stared at the blonde on the
floor.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fleur? Are you…" Ginny
watched as her mother flew to Fleur's side and helped her to stand.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Oui</em>, Mama."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny groaned as Fleur was
wrapped up in the arms of Amanda and her mother. The Apocalypse was
at hand.</p><p class="calibre9">"Get him the hell out of here
before I skin the dog alive!" Tonks pointed a finger at her
husband with a wild look in her eye. "For the love of Merlin,
Remus, go get pissed or something!"</p><p class="calibre9">Harry pulled Remus out of the
room and waved goodbye to Ginny with a grin on his face. Tonks was
right. Remus was useless. She'd gone into active labour three hours
earlier, right there in the middle of Harry's birthday party, and all
Remus could do was ask if she was feeling alright. He was nervous and
very much out of his element. In fact, Ginny was surprised that Tonks
put up with it as long as she did.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's mother had gone ahead
and examined Tonks once she was settled in the study and found that
she was already dilating and that her water had broken. That was when
Remus really lost it and nearly passed out. Tonks, Ginny swore, was
a very mean person when experiencing pain and even managed to bring
tears to Andromeda Tonks, her own mother, who was summoned
immediately.</p><p class="calibre9">"Tonks, look at me," Ginny
urged as she knelt in front of her on the floor. Tonks' eyes met hers
and Ginny was shocked at the fear she saw in her friend. "Remember
when you and Remus taught me yoga?"</p><p class="calibre9">Tonks nodded and winced as she was
hit by another contraction.</p><p class="calibre9">"Breathe with me, okay,
just like you taught me. Feel the air enter your body and flow all
the way down to your toes." Ginny held her sweaty hands and
exaggerated her own breathing in an attempt to calm Tonks down. She
smiled as Tonks did what was asked, and they continued their
breathing through the contraction. "Good, good. Now before the
next one, I want you to find your centre and imagine yourself lying
on a warm beach with the sun heating your skin…"</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny kept talking Tonks through the
contractions and before either of them knew it, it was time for Tonks
to get to work and meet her baby. Ginny never left her side and kept
talking to her and reminding her to breathe; she'd never felt so
confident or in control of a situation as she did at that moment,
helping in Tonks' delivery.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">After another four hours,
Phoebe Estelle Lupin entered the world. Her mother, tired and sweaty,
smiled and mouthed "Thank you" to Ginny as she left the
room. On her way out, she paused at the door and took in the scene
before her.</p><p class="calibre9">Remus sat on the edge of the
bed, stroking his wife's bubble-gum pink hair and stared at the
little bundle cradled in her arms. His hand left Tonks and went to
stroke the downy light fuzz on his daughter's head, and Ginny noticed
tears beginning to form in his eyes. Ginny had never seen a more
beautiful sight.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey, you," Harry
whispered as he leaned against the doorframe of the study. "That
was brilliant. You are brilliant." He leaned in and kissed her
softly on the lips. "Come on. Let's leave 'em alone."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny nodded and walked in
silence with Harry out onto the flagstone patio in the back garden.
It was nearly morning by now, but she was too wound up to sleep. He
stopped at some chairs that were still left from the party and they
sat down, hands still clasped.</p><p class="calibre9">"That's what I want to do,
Harry." Ginny smiled widely at him, feeling the pride just pour
off her. "I want to help mums deliver babies."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah? You did a great job with
her." Harry pulled her close and kissed the top of her head.
"Your mum did great, too. Looks like you and she can help Fleur,
too," Harry teased.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, won't that be a joy."
They both laughed softly. "Harry?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah?" He kissed her hair
again and hugged her tighter.</p><p class="calibre9">"It's been an odd year, hasn't
it?" She felt him nod. "But we made it, didn't we?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yep. I love you."</p><p class="calibre9">"I love you, too. Let's not
worry about the future, okay? We'll make plans when we need to."</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Phoebe means 'Goddess of the
Moon', and Estelle means 'Star.' </em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">PS—There is an epilogue!!</p>
