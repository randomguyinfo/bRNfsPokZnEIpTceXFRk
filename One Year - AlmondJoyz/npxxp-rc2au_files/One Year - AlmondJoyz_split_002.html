<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_3">*Chapter 2*: September</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Two:</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre8">September</em></p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
sat curled up in a window seat in the common room looking out over
the hills, trying to keep from feeling sorry for herself as she
waited for eight o'clock to roll around for her meeting with
Professor Lupin. She was so very lonely this year and it was only
the third week of school. Hermione was usually the one who listened
to her and gave her advice; she was more like a sister than a friend.
The other girls were, well, too girly and they didn't really have
that much in common with her.</p><p class="calibre9">Hell,
she even missed Ron. She smiled to herself, realizing she'd
forgotten what it was like not to have him around. He was a git, but
this was the first time since she was ten that she was on her own, so
to speak. He was annoying, over-protective, and as thick as
overcooked Polyjuice Potion, but she loved him because he was all
those things. As much as she hated to admit it, she missed her
brother.</p><p class="calibre9">Then
there was Harry. She knew it would be hard to be away from him after
being spoiled for so long, but even in her wildest dreams it was
never this difficult. Every nook and cranny of the common room held
some sort of memory of the two of them together: the sofa where they
used to cuddle, the rug in the middle of the room where they had
their first kiss, this window seat where they looked out at the stars
and shared their deepest secrets. She held back the tears, knowing
she needed to pull it together. The clock struck eight o'clock and
she headed out the portrait hole and towards Professor Lupin's
office. She knocked on the door, and was greeted by Tonks, who was
sporting a curly hairdo this evening.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey,
Ginny. He's expecting you." She then turned to her husband.
"Night, dear," she told him, making him blush as she left for
their quarters.</p><p class="calibre9">"Have
a seat, Ginny." His face looked all too serious.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
did you want to see me about Professor?" She kept her head down
and rolled the hem of her sweater between her fingers.</p><p class="calibre9">"Please
have a seat, Ginny." She looked up at her favourite teacher and
smiled quickly as he continued, "I've received word that your
classes haven't been going so well these first few weeks. What's
the matter?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
could only look up with glassy eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Is
it a who?" She nodded. He came around the desk and sat across
from her in the other chair. "I know you miss him, but you're
such a good student; I don't want this to get in the way."</p><p class="calibre9">"It's
not just Harry. I miss Hermione and Ron, too. I'm lonely, that's
all." Remus frowned at her answer. "Fine. I miss Harry more.
Why does love have to hurt?"</p><p class="calibre9">"It
doesn't. We make it hurt by ignoring it, not taking care of it and
not letting it grow. Believe me, I know." He looked at her sad
face and sighed. "Has he written?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
grinned. Hedwig woke her every morning and her pile of notes was
gathering some interest from her roommates. She even had to place a
spell on her drawer to keep them from snooping. "Hedwig's more
reliable than an alarm clock." She wiped her eyes on her sleeve.
"I just don't know when we'll be able to see each other. He's
so busy now and I'm stuck here."</p><p class="calibre9">"This
is your NEWT year and you are a very talented witch." A smile
started to creep up on his face. "That's why I wanted to speak
with you. Madam Pomfrey has spoken with St. Mungo's and they've
accepted you into Healer School. Pending your NEWT results, of
course."</p><p class="calibre9">Her
face suddenly brightened and she smiled. "Really? Oh, this is
fabulous!" She reached over and hugged Remus. "Oh, sorry,
Professor. Thank you!"</p><p class="calibre9">"But
Ginny, you need to get back on track in your classes. Potions is
very important. I've heard that you've fallen off a bit from
before, yet Professor Slughorn feels you are very adept at it. Did
you get your hands on Harry's book?" He raised an eyebrow as he
went around sitting behind his desk again. Harry was rather adamant
about not sharing Snape's old Potions book with her.</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
He's still got it. The prat wouldn't part with it." She
smiled remembering Harry's lecture to her about his Advanced
Potions book. "All he did was mark a few potions that I should
rethink. He didn't do anything else, Professor, honest."</p><p class="calibre9">"Good.
You need to learn that all by yourself." Lupin's mood changed
quickly and a smiled filled his haggard-looking face. "Hey, how's
the team shaping up?" Ginny was the new Seeker on the Gryffindor
Quidditch team.</p><p class="calibre9">"We're
terrible. Our new Keeper is awful and the chemistry isn't much
better. You better get ready to hand over that trophy, Remus.
Demelza is doing a great job trying to pull us together, but she's
not..." <em class="calibre8">Harry</em>. She took a deep breath. "Everyone seems
to think that I'll magically turn into Harry just because he's my
boyfriend and I've got his broom. But the team truly does stink.
It's pathetic."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
the Gryffindor reign is going to end on my watch." He had an odd
twinkle in his eye that belied his concern.</p><p class="calibre9">"Looks
that way. Sorry." <em class="calibre8">He doesn't believe a word I'm saying.
What's up with him?</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Minerva
will be so disappointed." Lupin leaned forward across the desk
conspiratorially. "Do you really think Demelza and I would let
that happen?" Ginny didn't understand, and it must have shown on
her face as he smiled and said, "We owled Harry and Ron last week
for help."</p><p class="calibre9">"What?" <em class="calibre8">I didn't hear him correctly did I?</em></p><p class="calibre9">He
sat back in his chair, a satisfied smile on his face. "Now, this
cannot leave the room. Demelza and I don't want everyone in the
castle to know, all right? They're coming next Saturday and we've
got the pitch booked all morning, starting at seven."</p><p class="calibre9">"No way! Oh that's fantastic!"
She got up and started pacing the room. "How long will they be
here?" Her face beamed with joy.</p><p class="calibre9">"They're
practising with you on Sunday, too. And I think one of the twins
will be coming, too. They both wanted to come, but the shop's
rather busy." He began to smile, too.</p><p class="calibre9">"Do the other Heads know?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You
kidding? Minerva would have kittens if this got out and the others
would have my pelt if they knew. They just think that we need the
practise more than anyone since we lost half the team in June." He
folded his arms over his chest, taking a serious stance. "Remember,
Ginny, don't tell a soul, okay? Not even the rest of the team.
Demelza wanted you to know because she knew how hard a time you've
been having. Now, go get your homework done because I know you
haven't been doing it!" He shuttled her out of his office,
looking quite pleased with himself.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
threw herself into her course work over the next week and found
herself caught up with everything she had fallen behind on. She and
Demelza huddled together in the common room every night, talking
about what they wanted to do in practise with Harry and Ron.
<p class="calibre9">"Oh,
I really hope Ron can help out poor Dennis. He better put him
through the paces, Ginny, or I'll never speak to your brother
again." Demelza checked her list of thing she wanted done at the
practise. "Do you think Harry can help with the Chasers?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah.
Why not? Are you going to try and get Ron to divulge some
Puddlemere secrets while you're at it?" The other girl smiled.</p><p class="calibre9">"He
bloody well better!" Demelza retorted. "It's hard enough
trying to patch this team together but I have to uphold tradition,
too. Harry sure has made it hard for me, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't take it so personally. You're
doing a great job. I'm just glad it's not me."</p><p class="calibre9">"Why
not? You have more experience, you know."</p><p class="calibre9">"Come on, let's get to bed. Hedwig's
been coming earlier and earlier these days. Damn that Potter."
The two of them giggled and they gathered their rucksacks and headed
up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
had a hard time getting to sleep that night and was tossing and
turning in her bed. Harry would be here in two days and her heart
was just bursting with excitement. She also kept remembering how it
felt sharing Harry's bed, even if in her dreams things progressed
much farther than they actually had. He could turn her insides to
mush with the slightest touch and sparks flew every time he had
kissed her. She shook her head and tried to fall asleep; her dreams
always drifted toward Harry.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Ginny!
That bleeding owl's here. Wake up!" She felt herself rustled
awake by Sarah Mitchell. Her eyes opened and saw her roommate's
face, blackened with soot.
<p class="calibre9">"Did
you really think he wouldn't put a charm on it? Really, Sarah."
Ginny sat up and held out her arm for Hedwig, who landed gracefully.
Ginny pulled the curtains around her bed and released the spell from
the note in a hushed voice.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Morning, Sunshine,</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Remus
told me last night you know about practise tomorrow. I would have
hoped he'd keep it a secret, but he said it had a dramatic change
in your work. I'm so glad I could help. And no, you're not
going to get my Advanced Potions book this weekend.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Stupid prat," she muttered.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Ron
is coming home after his last practise and we're Apparating to
Hogsmeade after dinner. We're staying at the Three Broomsticks.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hermione
can't make it. She wanted to, but she took on an extra project at
work. Typical. Fred's Apparating in the morning and he'll come
over with us. George's new girlfriend keeps him pretty close to
home, and won't be joining us. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I
tell you, though, it's going to feel odd being back there. I do
want to stop by Dumbledore's grave, though, if you don't mind. I
was told by the Ministry that I am NOT being held responsible for the
damage caused to the greenhouses and the Astronomy tower during the
final battle. Oh, gee, thanks. So nice to know that they
appreciated my efforts to free them from Voldemort. Assholes. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Well, I had better go. I'll see you
tomorrow!</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Love, Harry</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
couldn't wait. Tomorrow seemed like an awful long way from now and
she knew their time together would be too short a time the way it
was. After breakfast, she headed down to Professor Lupin's
classroom and found Tonks outside the door, trying to balance books
and parchments in her arms. She was wearing what looked like her
husband's old teaching robe and her hair was its normal brown but
was swept up into a knot at the base of her head. In Ginny's
opinion, she looked much too stuffy.
<p class="calibre9">"Morning,
Ginny. I'm covering for Remus this month." Ginny had forgotten
it was the full moon tonight.</p><p class="calibre9">"Nice
to see you, too, Tonks." Ginny held the door for her and they
walked into the room, which was nearly full already.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank
you, Miss Weasley," she said. Gone was the fun-loving young woman
Ginny considered her friend and in her place was an efficient, if not
rather clumsy, teacher. She set her pack on the table and waited for
the remaining students to arrive. The clock chimed the hour and she
spoke, "Professor Lupin has informed me that you were working on
the Patronus Charm in your last class, so let's clear away these
desks and give it a go." She waved her wand, and the benches and
tables sailed to the sides of the room and the class gathered in the
middle.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
already knew how to conjure a Patronus and was the example the class
was to follow. She performed the charm several times, and a silvery
doe trotted across the room each time. The only time she wasn't
able to answer a question was when she was asked, "Why is it a
doe?" She simply smiled and shrugged her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre9">The
rest of the day seemed to fly by and she kept looking at her watch.
Seven more hours. Five more hours. Three more hours. At nine, she
sat in the window seat and opened the window, looking out toward
Hogsmeade. Before the common room began to empty she had been asked
several times what she was waiting for, but she never answered. She
hated keeping secrets from her friends, especially Colin, but she'd
promised Remus.</p><p class="calibre9">Her
thoughts soon drifted back to her birthday party and the events that
followed. She was able to calm her nerves, and reluctantly fell
asleep.</p><p class="calibre9">A
light pecking on her head woke her to find Hedwig resting on her
shoulder. She quickly untied the note and sent Hedwig on her way.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hi.
Be at the fireplace in ten minutes. Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
fairly leapt off the window seat and sat in front of the fire,
impatiently waiting for him to appear. She charmed her hair smooth
and undid one of the buttons on her shirt, then buttoned it again. <em class="calibre8">Don't look like a slag, Ginny</em>, she told herself.</p><p class="calibre9">Then,
there he was. His hair was a bit longer and he looked tired, but he
was still her beautiful Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi! What time is it?" she asked
him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Half-
twelve. Ron's taking a shower." Harry raked a hand through his
hair. "How've you been?" His eyes brightened with the
question.</p><p class="calibre9">"All
right. I got accepted into the Healer program!" She had saved
this news so she could tell him to his face.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
that's awesome, Gin! Congratulations!" He turned serious. "I
miss you."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
I know. I was a mess before that meeting with Remus. Once I had
proper motivation I was able to catch up. We did Patronus Charms
today."</p><p class="calibre9">"And
how is my little wide-eyed doe doing?" He smiled widely at her.
Her Patronus changed shape once she and Harry got back together, and
he was so very pleased that hers was a doe.</p><p class="calibre9">She blushed. "I wouldn't say why it
was a doe."</p><p class="calibre9">"Good."
He looked down into his rucksack and grabbed something. "Do you
want some company?" His Invisibility Cloak lay in his lap.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are
you kidding? You can't come over here!"</p><p class="calibre9">He
started to pull the cloak over himself. "Gin, come on…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
you can't. You just can't. Oh, don't look at me like that."
He scoffed as he lost the puppy dog face. "I've got to get some
sleep because some stupid practise starts at seven in the bloody
morning." She laughed as she complained. It wasn't really a
complaint, though, since Harry was only a few miles away. "Don't
forget to send Hedwig. I stopped setting my alarm the fourth day of
class, thank you very much."</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
come on! I haven't seen you in over a month!" He looked
uncomfortable. "Do you know what that's doing to me?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes, I do, Harry Potter, and you'll
just have to go have a good wank now won't you? Now go to your
little bed. Alone. And dream of me."</p><p class="calibre9">"That
won't be a problem, Ginny," he said dryly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Good. But here's something to help
you along." She lifted up her shirt, and flashed him her breasts.
His mouth dropped and his eyes nearly popped out of his head. "Good,
night, Harry."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah." He was still dumbstruck.
"Love you."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
love you, too, Harry." <em class="calibre8">He's going to have some pleasant
dreams tonight.</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
didn't need to have Hedwig wake her in the morning. She woke up a
little before six, and got dressed. Breakfast wouldn't start for
another half-hour and everyone else was still sleeping. Ginny
grabbed a book and tried to read. It was hopeless. Harry's face
kept popping up on the pages and his voice echoed in her mind. Out
of the corner of her eye, she saw a white blur coming toward her.
Hedwig.
<p class="calibre9">"Morning,
girl. How are you? Did Harry just get up?" She stroked the
fluffy white owl and slipped her a little cracker from the drawer of
her bedside table. She reached down and removed the note from
Hedwig's foot.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Morning,
Sunshine.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Open
the window.</em></p><p class="calibre9">She
dropped the note on the floor and, springing from the bed, she stuck
her head out the window. There he was! He waved at her, begging her
to come down. She was down the stairs in a flash, ran across the
entrance hall, flung the huge oak doors open and leapt into Harry as
he held out his arms.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi!"
Ginny kissed him hard, surprising him immensely. Ginny wrapped her
legs around his waist and he carried her across the lawn and sat down
by a tree with her in his lap.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
I've missed you, Gin." He bent to kiss her again, more slowly
and tenderly this time. He teased her mouth apart with his tongue
and ran it along hers, savouring the taste, smell and feel of her.
She sighed into the kiss, which made him kiss her even harder and
with more determination. She tugged at his pullover, trying to lift
it off his shoulders, gave up and then pulled him tighter to her.
They fell back on the grass without breaking apart.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny..." Harry raised his head and
looked at her with a pained expression. "I'm cold." He
stifled a laugh and Ginny burst out laughing herself.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
all wet. Dew's a bit heavy." Ginny got up and noticed Harry's
pullover. "'Fraid that is, too. Sorry." He got off the
ground and kissed her again.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, that's easy enough to fix."
He did a drying charm on both of them and soon her clothes were warm
and dry.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks, Harry. Always knew you were
good for something." She gave him a quick kiss in thanks. "You
want some breakfast?" She grabbed his hand and began leading him
back to the castle.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, no one's supposed to know I'm
here." He pulled her to him again. "I'll see you at the
pitch. I just couldn't wait."</p><p class="calibre9">"When
did you wake up? You're not much of a morning person." <em class="calibre8">I bet
that IT has been up all morning.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"After
what I saw in the fire last night, I barely got any sleep. You are
quite the naughty witch, Ginevra." He had a little gleam in his
eye.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't
look at me like that or I'll never let you get over there to save
our sorry arses," she said. Ginny gave him one last hug and a
quick kiss before heading back to the castle.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey, Ginny," he called after her.
"Try and act surprised, okay. Greet me like that again, okay!"
She snorted in laughter.</p><p class="calibre9">When
Ginny got to the Great Hall for breakfast, the rest of the team was
at the table; half of them looked like they would fall asleep at any
second.</p><p class="calibre9">"Morning,
everyone!" Ginny greeted her team-mates. "Beautiful day for
flying!"</p><p class="calibre9">Dennis Creevey looked at her with a
glazed expression on his face. "When the hell did you become such
a morning person?" He sank his head back onto his folded arms,
trying to get some sleep.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, Professor Lupin feels we really
need to get our game back on, and that's why he booked us the pitch
this morning." Demelza tried to hide her smile.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
yeah," smirked Adam Donahue, the Gryffindor smart mouth. "Where's
Lupin then? Oh yeah! Holed up in his quarters because it's the
full moon."</p><p class="calibre9">Demelza's
smile faded and she told her team, "Come on then, get your gear and
let's go." They slowly rose from the table and trudged out into
the crisp morning air.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, you've got a leaf in your
hair," said Dennis, gently removing it. "Where'd you sleep?"
Ginny ignored the question and walked in silence with the others.</p><p class="calibre9">Coming
over the rise, they were able to see the pitch in the distance; three
figures were already there.</p><p class="calibre9">"Bloody
hell! That had better not be Ravenclaw stealing our time!" Adam
was livid. Ginny's heart skipped a beat.</p><p class="calibre9">As
they got closer, some team members started muttering to themselves
and then Demelza cried out, "Harry? Ron? Is that George?" She
wasn't a very good actress. "What <em class="calibre8">are</em> you three doing
here?"</p><p class="calibre9">The
mood of the team changed in an instant from glum to near ecstasy.
The three of them began greeting the others and Ginny hung back from
the group, watching Harry as he smiled and reminisced with the
others. She noticed Natalie MacDonald hovering near Ron, trying to
get his attention. The poor girl obviously hadn't got over her
crush on Ron. Her eyes once again fell on Harry and he looked up and
caught her eye.</p><p class="calibre9">"There's
my girl!" He strode over to her and swung her around, kissing her
again. "Morning, Sunshine!" They smiled a knowing smile. Harry
grabbed her hand and walked back toward the others.</p><p class="calibre9">"Morning, Fred, Ron," Ginny greeted
her brothers with a slight blush.</p><p class="calibre9">"So when did he wake you up?" Fred
asked dryly. He could always read her like a book. "You still
have some grass in your hair. Potter, next time, clean the ground
first if you want to keep your little trysts a secret, okay?"
Everyone laughed but Ron, which was typical.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay,
so this is why Lupin got us out of bed so early this morning,"
Demelza began. "He asked them to come and help us out and this
must remain top secret, or everyone will want them to help." Her
voice became more excited as she talked. "Dennis, you get Ron to
yourself and please, Ron, don't be gentle." Ron smiled. "Now
Harry's going to help me and the other Chasers while Fred takes on
the Beaters."</p><p class="calibre9">"So what is Ginny supposed to do?
Stare at Harry all day?" asked Ron. He was starting to wake up
now. "She played Chaser for two years, so why is she Seeker,
Demelza?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Because
she wanted to be. That and the fact that she's got the fastest
broom certainly doesn't hurt, either."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
Harry's still pulling strings, huh, Ginny?" Fred retorted. <em class="calibre8">He's
pushing my buttons</em>. Harry looked from Ginny to Fred to Ron to
Demelza with a worried look in his eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh,
Ron, Fred, leave her alone. You know she can out fly you any day,
you gits. Gin, I was going to save this, but <em class="calibre8">Accio Ginny's
present</em>!"</p><p class="calibre9">They
all looked toward the village and, with a sudden whoosh, along came a
package flying toward Harry, who casually stuck out his hand and
caught it. "Here, Ginny. You've finally got your own broom."
Ginny stared at him with her jaw dropped and quickly went to the
package, ripping off the brown paper.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry!
You..." She couldn't finish her sentence as she saw the brand
new Firebolt Pro looking up at her.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're welcome." Harry simply
smiled and looked at the others. "Well, come on. We're burning
daylight!" Harry grabbed his Firebolt from Ginny and took off into
the air.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Sunday's
practise was much the same as Saturday's, except they scrimmaged
for the last two hours. Fred, Ron and Harry were on one team with
Demelza and Charlie Nicholson while Ginny, Dennis, Adam, Jimmy and
Natalie McDonald were on the other. Ginny was really looking forward
to flying against Harry since he was at a disadvantage and had to
play Chaser as well. She found he was easily distracted by her and
seemed to have a problem sitting comfortably on his broom when she
was close.
<p class="calibre9">Her
broom was unbelievable. It was pretty much like Harry's Firebolt
but was a bit faster on the dives. She loved how comfortable she
felt as she zoomed past Harry and beat him to the Snitch, ending
practise.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gotcha, Potter!" she shouted at him,
giving the Snitch a quick toss and catching it in her hand.</p><p class="calibre9">The
team landed in the centre of the pitch and saw Professor Lupin come
walking toward them, looking more than a little tired. Tonks was
right behind him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well
done! I trust our guests were able to help," he asked. The entire
team then surrounded him, telling him all about the practises and
what they'd accomplished over the weekend. It was true. Ginny had
her misgivings about the team, but the three of them were exactly
what they needed.</p><p class="calibre9">Dennis,
even though he was a little shorter than Ron, was able to figure out
how to stretch across the goals while still hanging onto the broom, a
trick Ron inadvertently learned a few years ago. He also gained a
lot more confidence and got over being in Ron's shadow. Fred got
along quite well with Charlie and Jimmy. He taught them some of his
and George's old tricks to fool the opposing Chasers.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
hate to break this party up, but Ravenclaw's on their way down to
practise after lunch," said Lupin, "and I'd hate to have them
see our guest coaches." Fred and Ron began gathering up their
things but Harry strolled over to Ginny and Lupin.</p><p class="calibre9">"Remus,
can, uh, Ginny come to Hogsmeade?" Harry asked, looking rather
shy. "I didn't get to see her much this weekend. She got all
her homework done yesterday, right, Gin?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
yes, sir." She still had a Herbology essay to write and a
Transfiguration test to study for but that could wait; Ron hadn't
hogged all of the procrastination genes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ron
has to be back by two for curfew," Harry explained.</p><p class="calibre9">Professor
Lupin didn't seem to hear and coughed a few times as he headed back
toward the castle.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
ran to catch up to him and Ginny followed. "Remus, you still
haven't answered my question. Can she come to Hogsmeade for a
little while?" His face showed his impatience.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
Ginny, I can't. If I let you, then I would have to let everyone
else with an older boyfriend or girlfriend. It's not a trend I
want to start." Lupin's gaze was stony.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
looked the older man straight in the eye. "Remus, no one else
would know, if you understand me correctly." <em class="calibre8">The Whomping
Willow. The Shrieking Shack.</em> Ginny looked from Harry to Lupin
and back again. <em class="calibre8">Please, please, please.</em></p><p class="calibre9">Professor
Lupin took a deep breath and crossed his arms in front of him. <em class="calibre8">This
does not look good</em>, Ginny thought. "Absolutely not. By all
means try, but know this. If you do try to sneak her out, she will
have detention from here until Christmas! She could also forget
about the trip to Hogsmeade after Halloween. Understood?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Stop it! Fine.
I'll stay here then. Just don't fight; you're too good of
friends to fight over something like this," she snapped. "Can I
at least have an hour with Harry by the lake? Please?" She
watched Harry clench his jaw.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
have tried not to let my friendship with either of you get in the way
of my job here. You're pushing that boundary right now." Lupin
took a deep breath. "However, I will allow you, Ginny, one hour
before you must be back inside those doors. I will be waiting, make
no mistake."</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank
you, Professor," said Ginny softly. She furrowed her brow as she
fought to reign in her anger.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're welcome." Lupin looked to
Harry, whose expression had softened a bit.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fine.
And you're welcome for saving your Quidditch team. Let's go,
Ginny." Harry took Ginny's hand and they walked toward the lake,
stopping at the same tree they went to after their first kiss in the
common room Harry's sixth year.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry sat down and looked up at Ginny,
still standing in front of him. "Aren't you going to sit down?"</p><p class="calibre9">"He's right, Harry. He can't break
the rules just because it's you." She looked at him, hoping his
mood would change. "If you're going to stay angry, then I'll
just go back to the castle."</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm sorry. I'm
just...frustrated," he said with a smile, grabbing her hand and
pulling her down to him. She laughed as she fell into his lap.
Their laughter quickly faded as they looked into each other's eyes,
knowing what the other was thinking. The green of his eyes turned
dark as they bore into her.</p><p class="calibre9">No
words were necessary as their lips met, bridging the distance between
them as tongues began battling inside Ginny's mouth and their hands
started to roam across backs and into hair. Breathing became
secondary as their need for each other started to outweigh everything
else. For what seemed like an eternity, they sat there under the
tree, kissing each other senseless, not caring whether anyone would
walk onto the scene. He pulled away from her and gently lifted her
jumper off of her, leaving only a tank top behind. She wasn't
wearing a bra, and he swallowed hard. He reached for his pullover
and removed it, tossing it aside like a banana peel. Her fingers ran
across his chest, rubbing his nipples and feeling his chest hair.
His hand went to her shoulder and began to tug at the strap of the
tank top, stopping as if looking for permission. Millions of
thoughts ran through her mind as she watched him start to remove the
thin top. Cold air pierced her body, causing her nipples to harden
as the shirt was pulled off. He gathered her in his arms again and
started kissing her all over again, and explored the new territory he
had revealed. Her head fell back as she moaned and he moved to her
exposed throat, treating it to delicate kisses.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
looked at him and lay back, placing his hand on her breast, watching
him knead it and tease the nipple with his thumb. How many times she
dreamt of this, she didn't know, but this was better than any
dream.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
lay down on the top of her, careful not to hurt her. Their hips
moved to meet each other, his hardness pressing into her. He leaned
down and began kissing her again, more tenderly than before. His
hands ran down her arms, causing goosebumps along the way. Their
hips kept time with one another, causing Ginny to feel her body react
in ways it hadn't before. Her legs wrapped around his, causing
their rhythm to increase, and the kisses to deepen and grow more
frantic. She began to explode between her legs, sending out a small
gasp, catching Harry off guard, causing him to stop.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny?"
His breathing came in ragged, shallow gasps. "What is it?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Nothing,
I feel wonderful." She watched his face and knew that he was
turned on. <em class="calibre8">Oh no, what have I started here?</em> she thought.
"Harry..."</p><p class="calibre9">His
head fell onto her chest in resignation. "Why? Why, Ginny?"
His voice sounded so distant. "Please. I love you. I can't go
back now." He lifted his head and looked at her again, pleading
with his eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">"I want to, really, Harry, but..."
She couldn't stand the hurt look in his eyes and turned her head
away from him. He quickly rolled off of her and looked up at the
clouds, trying to slow his breathing.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
do you want from me?" he asked. Ginny couldn't tell if he was
angry or confused.</p><p class="calibre9">"I want you to love me. That's all.
I don't know if I can handle going beyond this yet. I thought I
could, but I can't. I'm sorry, Harry." He let out a huge
sigh.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin,
that's fine, and all, but don't you realize how hard it is for me
to stop? You're beautiful and your body...God!" He pulled shirt
back over his head. "I'm eighteen for goodness sake! I can
hardly take it any more!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't
you think I feel the same way? Merlin, Harry! You're in my
dreams, waking and sleeping. I can't concentrate on my homework
because I remember every little touch between us!" She took a deep
breath. "I just don't think I can make that commitment right
now. There's no going back once it's done."</p><p class="calibre9">"Is it all right if we just sit here,
then? We don't have much time left." He sat up, watching her
get dressed. She leaned against his chest and he wrapped his arms
around her protectively. "I love you, Gin. Don't forget that.
Can I come for the Hogsmeade weekend?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You'd
better." They sat under the tree and watched the giant squid
splash in the water. Harry looked at his watch and released her.
They stood up and started walking back toward the castle. As
promised, Lupin was waiting at the doors.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'll send Hedwig in the morning,"
he told her, kissing her lightly. "I love you." He grabbed his
broom and flew off as she walked into the castle.</p>
