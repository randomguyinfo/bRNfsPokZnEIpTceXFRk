			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Six:</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre8">January</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Does
everyone have all their things? Ginny, your dress?" Mrs. Weasley
was tittering around the lounge of The Burrow, checking and
re-checking everyone's trunks and the four garment bags that were
strewn across them.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
Mum. You already checked. Four times. Now come on, Dad's getting
impatient!" Ginny grabbed her mother by the shoulders and
stopped her pacing. "Everything is ready, and Dad wants to go.
Bill's waiting for the trunks; now let's get a move on!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
right then." Mrs. Weasley said a quick incantation and the
trunks disappeared with a pop. A few moments later, a piece of
parchment flew in through the fireplace and Ginny snatched it from
the air.</p><p class="calibre9">"He's
got them. It also says that Amanda's ready to go into labour."
Ginny's mother's eyes widened at the words.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?
But…but…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum,
it's a joke. He's telling you we're being slow. Get a grip!"
Ginny rolled her eyes at her mother, who took the note from her
daughter's hand. and they were joined by Mr. Weasley and Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
lot all set to go then?" Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch, and
picked up a gold dinner plate. "Grab hold now." Their hands
clasped the plate and all too soon, Ginny felt the strange tugging
behind her navel, transporting them across the sea to a valley in
rural Sweden.</p><p class="calibre9">"Damn,
it's cold!" Ginny shouted absently. "Why'd Charlie have
to get married in the middle of the bleeding winter?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginevra,
don't swear!" her mother reprimanded her. The four of them
walked toward the large house in front of them, and the door opened
without them knocking.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Hej,
välkommen till vårt hem</em>,"
said a small woman with greying hair and crystal-like blue eyes.
"Arthur! Molly!" The woman gave each of Ginny's parents a
warm hug.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
felt awkward and looked over at Harry, who looked just as
uncomfortable as she felt.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Du
måste vara Ginny</em>!" She then
found herself wrapped up in the woman's arms and merely nodded, not
knowing what in the world the strange woman was saying. "<em class="calibre8">Och
vem är det här</em>? The woman
looked at Harry, scanning him up and down.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Here
we go again. She's noticed the scar. </em></p><p class="calibre9">"Harry
Potter! <em class="calibre8">I mitt hem! Jag är så
ärad</em>!" She was nearly jumping
up and down, barely able to contain herself. "<em class="calibre8">Nils,
Harry Potter är i vårt hus</em>!"
Her voice jumped a few octaves as she shouted behind her. She took
hold of Harry's hands and voraciously shook them.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh,
hello there. Nice to meet you," Harry said with a nervous smile.</p><p class="calibre9">A
very pregnant brunette came up behind the woman, sounding frantic.
"<em class="calibre8">Mamma, mamma, lugna ner dig! Du
glömde översättningsformlen igen</em>!"
The young woman removed her wand and said more words Ginny couldn't
understand. "Really, Mother. Let the poor boy go!"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
felt her mouth drop as she suddenly understood the words. <em class="calibre8">What the
hell just happened? </em></p><p class="calibre9">The
young woman looked at Ginny and smiled. "Hello, there, Ginny.
I'm Amanda. Is this the first time you've ever witnessed a
translation charm?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh,
yes. Nice to meet you." Amanda put her arm around Ginny, leading
her and her parents into the front room while Amanda's mother kept
hold of Harry's hands and pushed him onto a settee, sitting right
next to him. "Harry, you'll have to pardon my mother. She
doesn't get out much anymore," she teased.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
Amanda! You are so rude!" She got off the settee and took
Ginny's cloak from her, motioning for her to sit on the settee next
to Harry. "My name is Eva. And my husband…" She glanced
over her shoulder. "Nils!" She shouted in a voice that
reminded Ginny of her mother. "The Weasleys are here. And they
brought Harry Potter!" Harry's face began to turn pink and his
head sunk to his chest while his body shook in laughter.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The
day of the wedding proved to be much more interesting than Bill and
Fleur's wedding. Granted, it was about fifty degrees colder than
Bill's, but things were much more relaxed; Harry wasn't leaving
to hunt for Horcruxes and war wasn't an imminent threat anymore.
Life was just, well, normal now. Ginny looked around at the reception
hall and noticed the smiles on everyone's faces. It made her heart
quicken to know that she had a part in it.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Amanda
and Charlie looked wonderful together. His red hair and her brown
locks complemented each other quite well. They reminded her of Ron
and Hermione who were, at the moment, totally enraptured with one
another and sat disgustingly close together. Amanda's belly was
rather humorous, and Ginny had to drag her mother away from Amanda
several times when she attacked her daughter-in-law's belly with
her hands.</p><p class="calibre9">"But,
Ginny," her mother had protested only moments before, "this
is my first grand baby, and I've missed out on everything!"
After that, Amanda took pity on her new mother-in-law, allowing her
to feel the kicks and take guesses on the gender.</p><p class="calibre9">Charlie
was so different now. Gone was the rakish devil who never talked
about anything but Quidditch, dragons and girls with differing shades
of hair. In his place was a strangely wonderful Charlie; one who
talked about love, babies and family. She watched him while he talked
to Bill, wondering what was on their minds. If Bill ever became a
father, that would surely be a sign of the Apocalypse. Not that Bill
wouldn't make a wonderful father, but the thought of Bill and Fleur
as parents is what really bothered her. Ginny didn't know what
would be worse, the little Veela prima donna complaining about
stretch marks or the fact that Ginny would actually have to accept
Fleur as a member of the family. Shaking her head at that thought,
she headed back over to the buffet table to drown her thoughts in
food.</p><p class="calibre9">Before
she could turn around, Ginny felt someone beside her and smiled as
she felt a breath on her neck. "I hope you know that I have a
boyfriend."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?
What's he like?" He began nibbling on her ear.</p><p class="calibre9">"Skinny,
has messy hair and can't see worth a damn without his glasses."
She giggled softly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well
then, he sounds pretty lame to me." Warm arms went around her
waist.</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
he's not," said Ginny as she turned around to face Harry.
"He's really rather sweet." She kissed him softly on the
lips. "I need some privacy." His face lit up and he
followed her as they began to weave their way through the crowd,
finally taking a seat on the stairs leading to the basement of the
hall. She sat down next to him on the narrow tread.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
looked so serious there. What's going on?" he asked. His hands
absently went to her hair and took out the clips that held her hair
in place during the wedding.</p><p class="calibre9">"Just
thinking. Charlie's married and becoming a father. That's a right
scary thought." She cocked her head to the side, taking note of
the way his hair fell across his brow. "I feel old."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry's
rich laughter echoed down the stairs. "You're seventeen! If
anyone should feel old, it's Hermione. Nineteen is ancient."</p><p class="calibre9">"You
git." She rolled her eyes. "I meant that so much has
changed in the last few months that it's just difficult to believe
that things as normal as having babies and weddings are taking place
again."</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
I did it for you," he whispered. He leaned in and kissed her
softly on the lips, teasing her lips apart with his tongue. The last
time Harry kissed her like this, they were in her father's shed at
Christmas and Ginny was trying to explain to him why she kissed
Jonathan Martin. His talented lips, tongue and hands soon made her
forget about everything and she felt herself floating along on a
cloud of pure bliss.</p><p class="calibre9">"Eh,
hem." The two of them broke apart and turned around to find Bill
looking down at them, his scars standing out in either anger or
amusement. "They're leaving. Bouquet and all."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
quickly stood up and helped Ginny to her feet as she smoothed her
dress and hair.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh,
Harry? You've got some lipstick right there," Bill pointed
out, briefly touching Harry's cheek. Harry turned red and quickly
rubbed it off as he muttered his thanks. They followed Bill back into
the reception hall and Ginny was immediately swept up by Hermione and
taken to the front of a large gathering of witches, all single.</p><p class="calibre9">"All
set, ladies?" Amanda teased them. "One, two, three!"
the little bouquet floated in the air, and without any effort or
pushing, it landed right in Ginny's arms. Applause filled her ears
and she felt a blush rise onto her cheeks. Her thoughts, however,
were not as innocent as the others imagined.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
dear, Mum, looks like there'll be another wedding to plan,"
Fred announced earning him a huff from his mother. Ginny also heard
the distinct sound of people choking on a beverage. Looking to her
right, both Harry and Ron were gasping for breath.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"So
your dad said that I could take you back to school," Harry
softly told her as they cuddled together in Harry and Ron's room at
the inn they'd been staying at. "The Portkey will take us just
outside the wards, and then I'll have to leave you at the gates."<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny
nodded slowly. They were lying on one of the beds in the room and
listening to the wireless. Ginny lay curled up alongside Harry and he
absently stroked her hair, occasionally twisting a strand on his
fingers. One of her legs was thrown over his knee and her head rested
peacefully on his chest. She loved the sound of his heartbeat and
began tracing circles around his chest, stopping at the points of his
nipples that formed.</p><p class="calibre9">The
thought of going back to school was not a very pleasant one. She
enjoyed the last week in Sweden and her time with Harry. But their
time alone was never enough and Harry was supposed to take her back
to Hogwarts in a few days. Her eyes began to sting as she tried to
hold back the tears.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey,
it's alright. I'll miss you, too, you know. I'll come for the
Hogsmeade weekend in February and we'll get all mushy at Madame
Puddifoot's, okay?" He hated that place and all its horrible
memories, but if that's what she wanted, he'd suffer in silence
for her. "Gin, don't cry. I lose all masculinity when you do
that."</p><p class="calibre9">She
snorted in response as she wiped her eyes. "So, um, how long do
they usually take?" Ron and Hermione had taken over Ginny and
Hermione's room a few hours ago, leaving the two of them alone.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,"
he began, shifting on the bed, "depends sometimes. Now
understand, I usually make myself pretty scarce and all, but one
night I was in the kitchen for three hours. I went up to my room, and
I could still hear the floorboards whining above me." Ginny
began to laugh, but he put his hand over her mouth. "It's not
funny, Gin! Do you have ANY idea what it's like to hear your two
best friends fucking all night while your girlfriend is in bloody
SCOTLAND?" He shook his head as she burst out laughing.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sorry.
But it is funny, you know." She turned towards Harry and softly
touched his cheek, enjoying the warmth of his flesh on her hand.
"Fred and George aren't going to be back for awhile. They're
still out with, um, Kristin and what's her name."</p><p class="calibre9">"Ingrid.
They're out with Kristin and Ingrid. And what, pray tell, are you
trying to tell me?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
Mr. Auror-in-Training, put a spell on the damned door so we can have
some time alone!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
I'm going back to school in two days! The last time we had a
snog--a <em class="calibre8">really good</em> snog--was back in November. Remember?"
Ginny remembered and she was sure Harry did as well. Harry's mouth
turned up in a wide smile. "The spell, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Pseudo
Portus</em>!" The door leading to the hall became eerily
semi-opaque. Harry added a second spell "<em class="calibre8">Alarum</em>!"</p><p class="calibre9">"What
did you do? I can see into the hallway."</p><p class="calibre9">"Auror
secrets. I'll have to Obliviate you later on, just so you know,"
he teased. "So, Miss Weasley, what kind of a snog did you have
in mind? Last time, I was the one who was starkers, right?" His
lips met hers and soon Ginny forgot all about going back to school
and being away from Harry. He kissed her softly, almost timidly until
he was satisfied it was okay. She deepened the kiss out of
frustration over his shyness. Their kisses became more passionate and
their hands grew bolder in their exploration.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin?
Can I?" Ginny opened her eyes and suddenly remembered that she
was without her shirt and Harry was in a similar state of undress.
Trying to focus on what he wanted, she looked down, seeing his hand
resting at the waistband of her sweatpants.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry's
eyes never strayed from hers as she nodded and felt his hand sneak
under the grey cotton and satin that covered her and settle on her
skin. Ginny knew she was wet and caught a shy smile play across
Harry's face. Placing her hand on his cheek, she drew him in for
another kiss, parting his lips with her tongue at the same moment
that his fingers parted her folds, slipping one finger inside her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Wow,"
he muttered against her lips.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mmmm,"
Ginny groaned against his mouth while she lifted her pelvis off the
mattress, pulling him farther into her. His fingers quickened, bringing a little shriek from her.</p><p class="calibre9">Their
lips separated with a small pop and Harry looked down at her. "I'm
sorry. Did I hurt you?" He began to withdraw his fingers, but
she held him fast.</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
Harry. I loved it." He smiled. "Yeah, right there." She rocked
her hips against his hand and again felt the ripples of pleasure
begin to build inside her. Harry watched her in fascination while she
arched her neck against the pillow and bit her lower lip. Little
sounds escaped her as he moved faster and faster.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny?
Love, are you alright?" He was gasping for air as Ginny
tightened around his fingers and let out a moan that reverberated
throughout the room. She wrapped her arms around him, letting the
aftershocks subside.</p><p class="calibre9">"Wow."
Ginny breathed as she brushed her hair off her face, feeling the
sweat along her hairline. She had never felt so good, so relaxed and
satisfied. But she knew, someday, there would be more. The prospect
of that situation brought a toothy grin to her face. "Thanks."</p><p class="calibre9">"My
pleasure," Harry murmured. "But, um, I need a little help
here." Harry rolled to her side and she felt him poking her. A
little laugh escaped her lips when her eyes landed on Harry's cock,
which was poking out of his boxers.</p><p class="calibre9">"Did
I do that?" He nodded. "Well, I guess I should fix it then,
yeah?" His arms went around her and gathered her close for
another kiss. As her hand drifted down Harry's torso, a disturbing
squelch filled the room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh bloody hell! It's Ron!" Harry bolted from the bed and threw Ginny's
clothes at her while quickly hopping into his jeans.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?
How do you know?" Her pullover went over her head and she barked
at Harry again once her head came through. "Harry? Answer me!"</p><p class="calibre9">"The
spell I put on the door. It's an alarm spell." Harry threw his
t-shirt over his head and sat on the sofa calming his breathing.
"Hurry up."</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
where the hell is my bra, Harry?" It flew across the room and
landed on her head. She sprang from the bed and ran into the bathroom
to finish dressing, slamming the door behind her.</p><p class="calibre9">It
wasn't three seconds after she shut the door that she heard Ron's
booming voice asking Harry to turn on the wireless so he could listen
to the Cannons—Portree game. Sounds of Quidditch fans filled the
air and Ginny sat on the toilet trying to calm down. Fully dressed,
she opened the door and walked over to Harry, giving him a quick peck
on the cheek.</p><p class="calibre9">"Good
night, Harry. Ron, you have a hickey on your neck. Have Harry teach
you a glamour charm or Mum'll freak." Ron blushed, bringing a
smile to Ginny's face as she left the room.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny's
mother was giving a wonderful impression of a mother hen as the young
Weasley made her preparations to head back to school. She'd been in
and out of Ginny's room for the past hour and a half and Ginny was
down to her last nerve.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Mum!
It's fine! I think I can pack for school without your constant
vigilance!" Ginny yelled, her voice clearly making it though her
mother's muttering.</p><p class="calibre9">Unexpectedly,
Mrs. Weasley wiped her eyes as she looked at her daughter. "Oh,
sorry. I promised I wouldn't do this." She sank onto Ginny's
bed and dabbed at her eyes with her handkerchief. "It's just
that you're the last one, and it's not long until you leave me,
too. Then you'll be headed off to Healer school and then you'll
get married to Harry…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum!
I never said anything about getting married!" <em class="calibre8">I thought about
it, but not now.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,"
she began, shaking her head, "I have eyes, dear. Harry is
completely taken with you and he has been for ages. You'll be
married before you're twenty."</p><p class="calibre9">"Mother!
I can't believe you!" This wasn't quite the conversation she
pictured having with her mother. "You've always told me to put
school first. Now you've already got me married off. So when am I
going to be a mother?" Mrs. Weasley took her daughter's hand
and motioned for her to sit next to her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Dear,
I know you're only seventeen, but I've known you and Harry would
be married ever since he defeated…Vol…Voldemort." <em class="calibre8">Wow,
she actually said his name. Good for you, Mum!</em> "He looks at
you the same way your father looked at me. And still does."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
really don't need to hear that mother," Ginny giggled.</p><p class="calibre9">"Bill
and Charlie have that same look. Yes, even for Fleur. She is growing
on me, dear." Ginny shut her mouth upon hearing her mother's
words. "Harry saved the world for you Ginny and whether he
admitted it or not, you were his motivation. I don't think he'd
be the same person if you weren't in his life."</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum,
I do love him. Very much." Her voice was soft and low, a mere
fraction of her normal tone, which surprised her. Ginny felt her neck
warm with her admission, never dreaming that she would ever have this
conversation. "He's my world. Or at least a very big part of
it." Ginny noticed Mrs. Weasley's expression change in a
millisecond, telling Ginny the conversation would be getting even
more serious.</p><p class="calibre9">"Now
have you and he…?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No!
No, no, no!" She sprung from the bed, feeling hot and
uncomfortable in her own room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Good.
But you are a grown woman and I didn't bring you up to do things in
the improper order," she reminded her daughter.</p><p class="calibre9">"But
you did Charlie?" Ginny saw her mother's expression change in
the blink of an eye.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
am not going to say anything about that. But I know you and I know
Harry. He's not that type of young man."</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum,
can I ask you a question?" She took her mother's hands and
looked straight into her eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Absolutely,
dear," she replied. "You can ask me anything."</p><p class="calibre9">"Did
you and Daddy wait?" Ginny could feel her heartbeat thump harder
within her chest. She wished she could take back those words.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,"
she began, taking a deep breath to calm her nerves, "I can't
lie to you. No, we did not. Times were different. Stop." She
placed a finger on Ginny's lips before she could get the protest
out of her mouth. "I was about to say that love never changes. I
wish you would wait until you are married, but I know I can't stop
you. Your brothers…yes, I know about them <em class="calibre8">all. </em> They at
least had the courtesy to keep their trousers zipped while they still
lived in my home."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
couldn't help but laugh. "Well, Ron kind of messed that up."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
really don't need to be reminded about that, young lady. The
blinding white of your brother's bum is forever etched into my
memory." They both laughed heartily before wrapping their arms
around each other in a hug. "Come now. Harry will be here soon
to take you back to school."</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>She
stood at the gates to Hogwarts, dreading to enter. It had started to
sprinkle, and Ginny was glad of it since it hid her tears from Harry.
His eyes were dark and he managed to hide his emotion from her behind
his glasses as they stood there in the rain. He softly touched her
cheek and stroked the tender flesh underneath her eye, wiping the
rain, or a stray tear, from her face.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Here
comes Remus." Harry's voice was soft , drifting away on the
wind that began to drive the rain harder across the landscape.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hello,
Ginny. Harry." Professor Lupin opened the gate from his side and
with a wave of his wand, made Ginny's trunk disappear; she knew her
things would be waiting for her at the castle. Looking up,, she
noticed her friend wore a huge smile on his face, despite the foul
weather.</p><p class="calibre9">"Evening,
Remus," Harry replied, appearing a bit amused by the older man's
appearance. "What's with you? They discover a cure for
Lycanthropy or something?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
Even better," Lupin replied.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
right, Remus. What could be better than that?" Ginny cocked an
eyebrow while she observed his face. <em class="calibre8">Ah, there it is. That little
gleam in his eye.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
Tonks won't be able to substitute for me much next school year,"
he told them. His grin grew even wider, if that was even humanly
possible.</p><p class="calibre9">"What's
wrong? Is she okay?" wondered Harry, sounding very concerned.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
and Remus began laughing at Harry, whose confused look only drove
them into further hysterics.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
Harry! I love it when you're thick!" She put her arms around
him and whispered in his ear. "She's pregnant, silly!"
Harry's face snapped toward his friend, eyes wide in shock.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are
you alright, Harry?" Remus asked. In answer, Harry launched
himself at the Marauder and hugged him. Laughter came from the two of
them as they pulled apart.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
that's fantastic! Bloody fantastic!" Harry reached over and
grabbed Ginny's hand, giving it a tight squeeze.</p><p class="calibre9">The
three of them stood there, in the rain, talking inanely about the
upcoming arrival of the littlest Marauder. Ginny learned Tonks was
ill all the time and that she had sudden cravings for rarer meat than
usual. No, they hadn't picked out any names yet and yes, the baby
would be fine and unaffected by Remus' condition. A heavy clap of
thunder reminded them of the reason they stood there.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
Ginny, we need to get you inside, I suspect." Remus still hadn't
stopped smiling. "I'll turn my back so you can give him a
proper goodbye." He slowly turned around and faced the castle.
It wasn't much privacy, but enough.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'll
see you next month for Valentine's, okay? I promise," Harry
reassured her. They leaned toward each other and kissed softly, not
allowing themselves to get too carried away. He pulled her in for a
hug and she closed her eyes, savouring the feel of his arms around
her and his rain-soaked scent.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
love you, Harry," she murmured against his neck.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
know. I love you, too," he whispered back as he pulled away from
her, holding onto her hand until it fell away as she entered the
gates of the school.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
decided that January was a boring month. Nothing happened at Hogwarts
in January. No Quidditch. No Hogsmeade trips. Nothing. After the
grand adventure of the trip to Sweden and her weeks with Harry,
nothing could really compare to what had already happened. Her school
work was nothing to get excited over, even after she was caught up
with everything that she missed. The month seemed to drag on forever.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">She
sat in the Great Hall for lunch one dreary Thursday, idly chatting
with Colin and Demelza when Hedwig dropped by to see her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi,
girl." She stroked the owl's feathers lightly, tossing her a
piece of roast beef. "How's Harry?" Hedwig hooted her
response. "Off you go now. Get some rest or Hagrid will kill
me." The snowy owl took off quietly and left the castle.</p><p class="calibre9">"So
what's new with Harry?" asked Demelza.</p><p class="calibre9">"Can
I read it first without you breathing down my neck?" Ginny
thought she sounded nonchalant, but Demelza's look told her she
sounded more irritated than amused. Her eyes scanned the page and she
unconsciously furrowed her brow. "Great. Just great."
Putting the letter into her bag, she got up from the table. "I
need some time alone. Sorry I can't talk about it right now."</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
okay, Gin. I'll see you in Defence, okay?" She nodded and
walked out the large doors to find her hiding spot behind a tapestry
on the fifth floor.</p><p class="calibre9">Settling
herself in a somewhat comfortable position, Ginny dug the letter out
of her bag and unfolded the parchment to reread Harry's letter.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Gin—</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">This

sure as hell better show up for Valentine's Day, Potter, or
there'll be hell to pay." Ginny crushed the letter in a ball
and set it on fire with her wand. As she watched the parchment turn
into ash, her thoughts sped towards Valentine's Day and her reunion
with Harry.<p class="calibre9"/><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><span class="calibre11">Author
Note:</span> I want to thank the lovely MillieWeasley for helping me
with the Swedish. Since most of you are not familiar with the Swedish

Welcome to our home," said a small woman with greying hair and
crystal-like blue eyes. "Arthur! Molly!" The woman gave
Ginny's parents warm hugs.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
felt awkward and looked over at Harry, who looked as uncomfortable as
she felt.</p><p class="calibre9">"You

arms and merely nodded, not knowing what in the world the strange
woman was saying.</p><p class="calibre9">"And

Potter! In my house! I am so honoured to meet you." She was
nearly jumping up and down, barely able to contain herself. "Nils!
Harry Potter is here!"</p><p class="calibre9">Her
voice jumped a few octaves as she shouted behind her. She took hold
of Harry's hands and voraciously shook them.</p><p class="calibre9">A
very pregnant brunette came up behind the woman, sounding frantic.
"Mama, Mama, calm down!" The young woman removed her wand
and said more words Ginny couldn't understand. "You forgot the
Translation Charm again!"</p>
