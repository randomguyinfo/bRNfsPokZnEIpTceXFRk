<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_9">*Chapter 8*: March</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Eight:</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre8">March</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
punched her pillow for what seemed like the thousandth time that
night, trying to get comfortable and fall asleep. She'd gone to bed
almost three hours earlier, and yet hadn't slept a wink since. The
true reason for her restlessness came to mind: she had a fight with
Harry during their Floo call earlier that night.<p class="calibre9"/><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"Hi,
Gin." Hermione was right, he did look terrible. His normally
unruly hair was cropped short, and she could almost see his scalp. He
looked like a starved monk.</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Hey."
She tried to hide the bitterness in her voice, but was unsuccessful.
This wasn't going to be a pleasant call.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Look,
Gin, I'm sorry." His eyes pleaded with her from the fireplace
of his bedroom, and if she hadn't been so angry with him she might
have felt pity toward him.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Trying
to get her emotions under control, she took a deep breath. "You
really hurt my feelings, you know. You told me to make all those
plans and then you forgot." An angry tear surprised her as it
slipped down her cheek. She hated feeling like this.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I
had a lot on my mind. I was at boot camp and was busy every day. I
hardly ever got a break, Ginny."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"But
you did have enough time to think about the gala, keep me from
attending, and write to me about that, did you?" Ginny huffed in
annoyance and crossed her arms in front of her chest.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Is
that what this is about? The gala? I thought you understood me when I
explained it to you." Harry shook his head in annoyance. Ginny
knew that look and was quite familiar with it.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I
thought I did" She paused, taking a deep breath as her anger
slowly turned into bitterness. "So who did you take? Was she
prettier than me? Did you fuck her, Harry?" The words were out
of her mouth before she knew it and quickly realised she couldn't
take them back. But a part of her really didn't care. She wanted
him to hurt. She wanted him to feel as miserable as he had made her
feel. "This isn't the first time in the school year that you
didn't want me to go to London. Who are you hiding?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"There
is NO ONE else! I didn't want you here because of the press. I
can't even go to Fortescue's without getting mobbed," Harry
shouted. He stood up and paced around the room. When he returned, he
wore the same look he did when he'd killed Voldemort. "I don't
want to put you through that. The one time was bad enough."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Trying
to protect me again, huh, Harry? Don't think Ginny's a big enough
girl?" That was low, and she knew it. When he had left to hunt
for the Horcruxes with Ron and Hermione, she'd felt like she'd
been stabbed in the heart. She hated it when he thought she couldn't
take care of herself.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"That
is not the reason, and you know it."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Whatever.
Are we done?" She checked her fingernails for dirt.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"No.
I miss you." Harry looked pathetic, staring into the fire. She
knew she should forgive him, but the hurt went too deep.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Good.
Why didn't you call before now?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ginny,
you sent Hedwig back without even reading any of my letters. I didn't
think you'd even wanted to even see me." She let out a little
snort of laughter in spite of herself.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"You've
got a point there." </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">He
returned her smile.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I
was a mess."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"You
still are. Your hair looks terrible." He looked like a prisoner
of war. Harry's soft, raven locks were gone and in their place was
stubble about half an inch long. It didn't suit him in the least.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
he muttered, running a hand over the remaining hair on his head.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"No
problem." Ginny adjusted her legs underneath her as her foot
was beginning to fall asleep. "So what did you do on
Valentine's Day, then?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry
stared into the fire on his end, shifting uncomfortably. Ginny knew
him well enough to know that he was hiding something. Something he
was desperately trying to avoid telling her.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Harry…answer
the question."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Hope…"
He barely got the word out before she erupted in anger.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"You
spent the day with HOPE?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ginny,
she woke up…" </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Ginny
swore under her breath. "And you had to be her hero, didn't
you? She almost killed you and Kingsley. She almost RAPED you,
Harry."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"NO!
We needed to question her and debrief her about the whole thing. It
took all day," he protested. His eyes were wide, giving him the
look of a man possessed. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"And
I suppose the fact that she's gorgeous didn't matter at all"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Stop
it! You know that's not true, Ginny." Harry looked her in the
eye and took a deep breath. "I love you. You, Ginny. I've shot
her down every time she asked me out."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"She
asked you out? When were you going to tell me this? I knew she
fancied you, but…"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Nothing
is going on between us. You're being stupid." Harry realised
the error of his comment, and his mouth hung open as he tried to form
words to take away his statement.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Oh,
fuck you, Potter." Ginny rose from her place on the floor and
began marching toward the stairs. She felt like throwing something at
him but stopped, realising it wouldn't do any good at all.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ginny!"
His shout stopped her dead in her tracks, making her turn around, her
eyes blazing with a mixture of anger and hurt.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"No,
you listen to me, Harry Potter!" she shouted, her finger
pointing at his image in the fire. "You hurt my feelings. You
made the day miserable for me. You forgot our date, and I had to
fight off Jonathan AGAIN while you spent the day with another girl.
How am I supposed to feel, Harry?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"That
was NOT my fault!" The flames of the Floo call grew with Harry's
remark. "I wanted to come right away when Tonks told me, and you
knew that! Why couldn't you Floo me right away yourself? I had to
hear it from Tonks the next morning!"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Harry,
I was embarrassed, okay? I was stupid believing you'd want to meet me
in a cave," Ginny muttered, more for her benefit than Harry's.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ginny,
you didn't do anything wrong. He brought this on himself," Harry
told her, his anger having calmed somewhat. "Are you sure you're
alright?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I'm
fine, Harry. I can take care of myself, you know," she reminded
him yet again. "I have to go," she said, hiding a yawn
behind her hand. "I have practise tomorrow morning."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"That's
right! You got reinstated!" </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Ginny
couldn't help but notice his attempt at being cheerful.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Yes.
You</em> <em class="calibre8">can remember my status on the House team, but you forget
me on Valentine's Day?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"When's
your game? I want to see it," he pleaded.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ask
my brother. I think he has loads of free time these days. Hermione is
hacked off at him, too." She couldn't quite remember why her
brother and friend were fighting, but she assumed it had something to
do with her brother's prat-like behaviour that had been blown out
of proportion by Hermione.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Don't
remind me."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Saturday
after next," she stated calmly, not quite willing to get her
hopes up.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I'll
see you then?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"If
you want." She smiled at him, failing to hide her pleasure at
the prospect of a visit from him.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I
love you, Ginny."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Mmm
hmm." She watched as the flames died in front of her and Harry
disappeared into his room.</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
wiped the errant tears from her cheeks. She hated crying. She hated
what Harry had done. She hated how she treated him earlier that
night. She hated feeling as if the world was against her when all she
wanted was to finish school and be with him in the world they'd
helped save. But she knew deep down that nothing like that would
happen if she kept acting like this. She had to forgive Harry, but
he also needed to know that a repeat of Valentine's Day was
unacceptable.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Sitting
on the edge of her bed, she sighed heavily, a determined set in her
jaw. "Am I a Weasley or not? Come on, Ginny, you give Fred and
George a run for the money," she gloated into her curtained bed.
"You can find something that will finally make Harry Potter
realise that Ginevra Weasley is not a witch to be trifled with."</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny's
spare moments were rare as she set out to find a spell that would
teach Harry his lesson. Her homework took first priority, but she
often found herself looking through heavy tomes of spells instead of
studying for her NEWTs. She was able to sweet-talk Professor Slughorn
into giving her access to the Restricted Section of the library,
which she took advantage of on a particularly dreary Sunday.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Her
head was buried inside <em class="calibre8">Vision Spells: Beyond Correction</em>, a
rather thin book compared to the others she had found. The title
intrigued her only because of Harry's pathetic vision. She shook
her head wondering how the Wizarding world could do so much with
magic, helping all sorts of ailments, and making life easier in
general, yet they couldn't do a thing about correcting one's
vision. <em class="calibre8">When I'm a Healer, that'll be a definite research
project,</em> she told herself on Harry and her father's behalf.
Percy could go blind for all she cared.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
that's interesting." Her voice echoed in the alcove she sat
in, causing her to look around in case Madam Pince was lurking about.
Ginny reached inside her book bag and pulled out a parchment and
quill, taking down the incantation of the spell she found.</p><p class="calibre9">When
she finished copying the information, she made notes at the bottom to
complete the spell and reread it with a smile on her face.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"The
Vision Confusion Charm was developed in the early 20th
century to confuse Muggles who happened to live in close proximity to
Wizards. The main purpose of the spell is to confuse the victim,
making them see things that aren't there or to see what the caster
desires. It has been used in various forms over the years, but has
dwindled in popularity due to the rise and ease of the traditional
Confundus Charm.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">The
incantation must specify what the victim can and cannot see. A vessel
for the spell is necessary, such as spectacles. Once the victim of
the spell puts the glasses on, the spell will activate and continue
to work even if the glasses are removed. The effect will continue
until the caster removes the spell. For this reason, among others,
the Vision Confusion Charm has fallen out of favour."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Primary
incantation: </em></p><p class="calibre9">Conturbo
oculus</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Incantation
to charm the glasses:</em></p><p class="calibre9">Muto

Weasley's clothing!!! (<em class="calibre8">He will
finally see me naked!)</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Reverse
Incantation:</em></p><p class="calibre9">Reverto
<em class="calibre8">(specific item from above)</em> Ginny
Weasley's clothing</p><p class="calibre9">Feeling
utterly satisfied with herself, Ginny shut the book and replaced it
on the shelf before leaving the library.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"What?
Are you crazy, Ginny? That's just…just…"<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Brilliant?"
Ginny finished Hermione's sentence with a smirk.</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
It's cruel, devious…and, well, yes, brilliant." Hermione
allowed herself a tiny smile at the corners of her mouth. "He'll
never forgive you."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
he will. I could have done something much more physically impairing,"
Ginny pointed out. She sat back on her heels and watched Hermione
through the flames of the Floo call.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
had contacted Hermione to enlist her help in carrying out her plan
for the change in Harry's vision. The Quidditch match was in two
days, and after trying out the spell on Colin and Dennis, Ginny was
confident that the spell would work on Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">The
Creevey brothers were rather amused at the lengths she was wiling to
take in order to teach Harry a lesson. However, much to Dennis'
chagrin, the test did not include them in being able to see Ginny
sans clothing. Rather, they had seen Professor Slughorn in the buff,
and that vision was enough for them to keep their mouths shut.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
wanted to make sure she had all her bases covered. "I've
tested it and the spell works. I just need you to bring me Harry's
glasses on the way out to the Pitch, and then I'll cast the spell.
He won't notice a thing is wrong until I come out onto the Pitch."</p><p class="calibre9">"You're
sure?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Positive.
Colin and Dennis will give you testimony to its effectiveness if you
want proof," she responded.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!
What did you do to those poor boys?" Hermione's expression was
a mixture of horror and amusement.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,"
Ginny stammered, "they volunteered to help me out." Ginny
was barely able to contain her laughter. "For a price."</p><p class="calibre9">Hermione
guffawed at Ginny's statement. "Have you been channelling Fred
and George? You're sounding too much like them." Hermione
chuckled lightly. "Fine, I'll do it." She turned around
to look into her sitting room. There was a crack, signalling
someone's Apparation. "I think that's Ron. I'll see you
Saturday."</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay,
Hermione. Thanks a lot!" The fire died out as Hermione doused
the flames, leaving Ginny sitting in front of the empty hearth.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
shaded her eyes against the sunlight on Saturday morning. She thought
she'd caught a glimpse of Harry, Ron and Hermione heading down the
path to the Quidditch Pitch. The figures grew larger the closer they
got to the castle, and she smiled as Harry's face came into focus.
He looked better than the last time they talked; his hair was growing
back but it was still unnaturally short. His hands were stuffed into
the pockets of his cloak, and he looked grumpy to say the least. Not
wanting to appear too anxious, Ginny calmly left the area outside the
changing rooms and headed toward the trio. Ron caught sight of her
and waved excitedly at his sister.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!"
Ron cleared the remaining distance between them and enveloped her in
a warm hug. "Whatever it is you're going to do to Harry, make
him hurt. I didn't speak to him for a week," Ron whispered in
her ear. Ginny's mouth fell open as he pulled away.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're
so sweet, Ronnie!" she teased. She usually hated when Ron pulled
the big brother act, but this really surprised her. "Don't
worry, he will."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
and Hermione arrived and Ginny made a point of greeting Harry coldly.
She did, however, allow him to hug her, which made her want to melt
right there into his arms. While the hug itself didn't last long,
it felt as if time stopped and Ginny took in every little detail
about him. He'd washed his hair that morning and she could smell
his shampoo and soap. He still had the leftover fragrance of cinnamon
from his toothpaste on his breath that mixed with the musky scent of
his cologne. Harry's skin was rough against her cheek, almost as if
he forgot to shave and his warm breath against her neck sent shivers
up and down her spine.</p><p class="calibre9">She
pulled away and kissed him quickly on the cheek. "I wasn't
sure you were coming."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
said I would, Ginny. I missed you." Harry reached for her hand
and she let him take it as they walked toward the changing rooms.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!
Demelza wants you back in here!" Ginny turned toward Natalie
McDonald, who gave Ron an exaggerated wink, standing near the door.</p><p class="calibre9">"Be
right there, Natalie." Ginny turned back toward Harry. "I'll
see you after the match, okay? We'll talk then." She tried to
put an ominous tone to her voice but wasn't sure if she had pulled
it off. "See you, Ron, Hermione." Ginny widened her eyes
and nodded at her friend before heading in to meet with the team.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
and the rest of the Gryffindor squad listened half-heartedly to
Demelza's pep talk. They were leading in the Quidditch Cup, and she
kept reminding them that they needed this win to assure that
Gryffindor won their third straight Quidditch Cup. Tradition, after
all, was on the line.</p><p class="calibre9">The
team had a few minutes left before they needed to head out onto the
pitch, they were sitting on the benches when Hermione flew in.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!
Here! I knocked the glasses off Harry and told him I would clean the
lenses, so do the spell." She was out of breath and looked
nervous.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay,
Hermione. Calm down. You're making me nervous." Ginny removed
her wand from her inner pocket and began the wand movements and
incantation. "<em class="calibre8">Conturbo oculus</em>." A flash of blue
light sparkled from the end of her wand. "<em class="calibre8">Muto oculus</em>."
Harry's glasses glowed purple. "<em class="calibre8">Eximo Ginny Weasley's
clothing</em>!" The lenses turned orange, then blue, and then
returned to normal. "There. It worked. It did the same thing
when I tested it on Colin and Dennis. Go!" Hermione took off,
glasses in her pocket, leaving Ginny smiling broadly.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Now
entering the Pitch… the Gryffindor Team!" announced Ethan
McClelland, amidst shouts of joy and boos of annoyance. "Captain
Robbins! Donahue! MacDonald! Peekes! Nicholson and Wheeez-leeeeeee!"
Ginny cringed at the way Ethan said her name. He started saying it
that way in the halls between classes and the git knew she hated it.
Ginny quickly scanned the crowd, wanting to find Harry, Ron, and
Hermione and make Harry aware of his new vision as soon as possible.
She mounted her broom and made her way slowly around the arena.
There. She saw him, eighth row from the bottom. As Madam Hooch
approached the centre of the pitch, Ginny pulled directly in front of
Harry, did a small circle on her broom, and finally turned her bum
Harry's way. She wiggled her hips suggestively, knowing that all he
could see was her firm round buttocks with the words, "Potter is
MY King," written across her backside in magical lipstick. She
was completely ruthless.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">All
through the match, Ginny felt distracted… with good reason, of
course. She knew Harry was ogling her and not because of her
Quidditch skills. A few times, she flew past him and noticed his eyes
resembled dinner plates; the feeling made her uncomfortable. She
loved Harry, loved spending time with him and kissing him, loved his
body, and what the pleasure he could give to hers. However, knowing
that all he was focused on was her naked form made her feel uneasy.
She didn't want him to love her because of that, and decided she'd
remove the spell as soon as possible.</p><p class="calibre9">In
her distraction, she lost sight of the Snitch and nearly cost her
team the match. But a well-timed push against the Hufflepuff Seeker
gave her enough time to speed up and snatch it from her opponent.
Cheers rose from the crowd and she swiftly swooped to the ground,
anxiously looking for Harry. Gryffindors and Ravenclaws alike
immediately mobbed Ginny in the middle of the pitch, and she found
herself swamped, unable to move away and look for him. The mob
surrounded the entire team all the way to the changing rooms, and she
barely escaped into the cavernous locker room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!"
She turned to see Demelza at the door, holding it open. "Someone
wants to talk to you!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Who?"</p><p class="calibre9">"It's
Harry, Ginny," Demelza said softly. The door opened to reveal
Harry with a full head of hair and a look of utter shock and
embarrassment. He smiled at Demelza and walked across the room to
Ginny, trying to avoid looking at her.</p><p class="calibre9">The rest
of the team began to filter out of the changing room, and soon they
were left alone.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi,
Harry," she said with a slight giggle. "Something wrong?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Remove
the bloody spell, Gin. NOW!" His eyes fell to the floor and he
began tapping his foot impatiently.</p><p class="calibre9">"Give
me your glasses, okay?" He handed them over and she drew her
wand. "<em class="calibre8">Reverto Ginny Weasley's clothing</em>." Harry's
glasses glowed pink, signalling to Ginny that the spell had been
successfully removed from them. "Put them on. They'll fix your
eyes, too." He took the glasses from her and placed them back on
his face. His eyes sparkled pink for an instant as well. "Better?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You
are cruel, evil and <em class="calibre8">damn sexy</em>, you little wench!" Harry
pulled her to him, kissing her hard. Breathing was secondary as she
responded to his kiss. Their teeth clashed against each other while
Harry continued his assault on her mouth. He removed his lips from
hers with a loud noise and looked her in the eye. "Don't you
EVER do that again! I couldn't look at you. I couldn't look at
Ron. I couldn't sit. I couldn't even enjoy the game. Stop
laughing at me!" Harry lost the battle with his own laughter and
joined her now raucous laughter.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
think I'm sexy?" she asked, looking innocently up at him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Do
you even have to ask? Where'd you find that spell anyway?"</p><p class="calibre9">"The
Restricted Section. I sweet-talked Slughorn," she admitted.
"Will you please excuse me now so I can shower and change?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You
want some company?" <em class="calibre8">Where did that come from</em>?</p><p class="calibre9">"No!"
Although, if Ginny were truly honest with herself, she would have
admitted that the thought was a rather delicious one. "Be a nice
boy and wait for me outside. I know all sorts of vision spells now,
Potter," she warned. She kissed him quickly on the cheek and
watched him leave the room.</p><p class="calibre9">Once
she was showered and freshly dressed, Ginny met Ron, Hermione, and
Harry outside the changing rooms, smiling at the three of them.</p><p class="calibre9">"So,
what are we going to do for the rest of the day?" she asked,
receiving a blank look from Ron and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh,
we're going home. I have a game tomorrow, remember, so I have to
get back in about an hour," Ron reminded her. "Hermione
leaves for Portugal tonight. Actually, love, why <em class="calibre8">are</em> we
hanging around this lot when you're going to be away for three
weeks? Let's go home!" Hermione blushed furiously as Ron took
her hand, and the two of them dashed off toward the gates of Hogwarts
with Hermione waving good-bye.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
I guess we know what they'll be up to for the next hour,"
Harry stated. He looked over to Ginny and gave her a lopsided grin.
"So…uh…it's just you and me, huh?"</p><p class="calibre9">She
eyed him suspiciously, looking out the corner of her eye. Ron didn't
have a game tomorrow. She knew he was lying, simply because she knew
Natalie. If there really were really a game, Natalie would have been
sure to fawn all over Ron. Harry was up to something, she just knew
it.</p><p class="calibre9">"Master
of the obvious, aren't you, Potter?" Ginny cleared the small
distance between them and stood in front of Harry, her body touching
his ever so slightly. "So what's your plan? Ron doesn't have
a game." She watched Harry swallow and put on a smirk.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fine.
I told Ron I wanted to be alone with you, okay. Is that so wrong?"
Harry reached up and tucked some of her hair behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
reckon not. It's actually kind of nice. Lemme guess, you got
another room at The Three Broomsticks?"</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
shifted his feet and looked at her with a pained expression. "Is
that really what you think I'm after? To get into your knickers?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Well…I,
uh," she stammered. She was utterly gobsmacked. After all they'd
done together, this was a surprise to her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
it's not. Yes, you drove me spare during the match and yes, I've
been a right, randy bugger," he began before taking her chin in
his hand, "but I love you, Ginny. You, and only you. All the
other stuff is nice, but I just like spending time with you." He
let his hand fall and they resumed walking again, hand in hand.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
wiped stray tears from her eyes. She hated crying and Harry knew it.
He squeezed her hand and she knew he was smiling. "I feel so
stupid, Harry."</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
no. It's okay. I'll survive, you know." Ginny chuckled.
"Lots of people don't have sex at eighteen. I'll manage and
so will you."</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
you always ask me to," she reminded him.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
a guy. You can stop laughing at me now." She noticed that they
were on the outside perimeter of the school grounds. He stopped by a
large willow tree and sat down underneath it, motioning for her to
sit next to him. Ginny joined him and he pulled her into his
shoulder. "Gin, that's not what's important. I want to be
with you. Just you, okay?"</p><p class="calibre9">"But
what about, well, snogging?" A little giggle escaped her lips.
"Don't you like that?"</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Yeah</em>,"
he answered quickly and enthusiastically. "But I know you're
not ready for more, and to be honest, I'm not sure I am either.
From what Ron says, it's a bit addictive once you start, and I
don't think I want that feeling while you're all the way up
here." Harry blushed a shade of pink, and he turned away from
her when he saw the look in her eye.</p><p class="calibre9">"So
how randy do you get, Harry?" She reached over and turned his
face back towards her. "How bad is it?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Remember
how Ron used to behave whenever he saw Hermione in a bathing suit?"
Ginny smiled at the recollection. "Multiply that by around a
thousand." Her eyes widened.</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?"
He nodded his answer. "Wow."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah.
And Ron keeps teasing me that I'll go blind in a year if I keep it
up." They both laughed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ass.
You just remind him about Moody's Castration Potion, and he'll
shut up. He's really worried about that one." Harry pulled her
in for a quick kiss.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't
ever doubt how I feel about you, Ginny," he began seriously. "I
love you, and if I could have been here last month, I would have just
to save you from what Martin put you through. <em class="calibre8">You</em> should have
told me yourself."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
know. I think I was still in shock for a while. If you remember, I
was a little upset with you," Ginny reminded him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Will
you ever forgive me for that one? Please?" Harry placed both his
hands on her face, and stroked her cheeks with his thumbs. "I
will spend the rest of my life trying to make it up to you if that's
what it takes."</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">He said
the rest of his life!</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Not
that long, Harry. Maybe twenty-five years," she whispered,
meeting him half way for a kiss that cleared her mind of all doubts.
<em class="calibre8">Maybe only twenty-five seconds</em>, she told herself, <em class="calibre8">but I
won't let him know that</em>.</p>
