<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_5">*Chapter 4*: November</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Four:</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre8">November</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Morning,
Hedwig," Ginny told the white owl as shet sat perched at her window
of the dormitory.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Morning, Sunshine.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I brought Hedwig with me so you'd
wake up. I know you don't like to get up early. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Let me tell you one thing…if
Jonathan Martin thought that cancer was bad, wait until he has to
deal with me. I'm not going to hurt him. I'm just going to make
him remember who he's dealing with.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I love you.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">PS—Come to the Three Broomsticks.
Alone. I need some private time. Wink, wink.</em></p><p class="calibre9">She
had always thought she was an independent, strong-minded witch who
didn't need to be coddled or taken care of, but part of her really
enjoyed the fact that Harry wanted to do just that.</p><p class="calibre9">"So,
are you meeting Harry in the village?" asked Sarah from her bed on
Ginny's left. Hedwig had been rather noisy that morning, waking up
the other girls in the room. Her look was a little too eager for
Ginny's comfort.</p><p class="calibre9">"Why
do you care? What difference could it possibly make in your life,
Sarah?" <em class="calibre8">I really don't like her anymore</em>, Ginny thought.
She quickly folded up the note and placed it in the drawer, sealing
it with a new non-verbal spell. "Don't ever talk to me again."
Ginny got off her bed and grabbed her clothes to head to the
bathroom, noticing the utter look of utter shock on Sarah's face as
Ginny passed. She changed quickly and left the tower.</p><p class="calibre9">Down
in the Entrance Hall, she groaned as she saw Jonathan standing by the
doors with Ethan and Ian. The three of them looked up with huge
grins on their faces and Jonathan motioned for his two mates to go
into the Great Hall so he could wait for Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"Morning.
Where are you off to so early?" He casually crossed his arms and
leaned against the wall. "They won't let us leave for a couple
hours yet. I've already checked." His eyes were a bit darker,
more mysterious this morning. Ginny needed to be careful and not let
on that she knew about his plan.</p><p class="calibre9">"None
of your business, Jonathan." She turned toward the Great Hall but
he grabbed her arm. "Let me go."</p><p class="calibre9">"Come
on, Ginny, be nice. I'm not contagious, you know. I just like to
go after what I want. And at the moment, that's you." He
grabbed her other arm and pulled her close to him. He leaned over
quickly and kissed her on the mouth. Ginny bit his lip and shoved
him away. "Like it rough, do you?"</p><p class="calibre9">Before
he knew what hit him, Ginny hexed him. His face blew up with
bat-sized bogies and he ran up the stairs, cursing. <em class="calibre8">That felt
good</em>, she told herself. Entering the Great Hall, she walked to
the Ravenclaw table and stood next to Luna.</p><p class="calibre9">"Come
sit with me." Luna grabbed her plate and walked with Ginny to the
Gryffindor table, where they joined Colin and Dennis at one end.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey,
you two. Ready for the trip?" asked Dennis. He was wearing a
baggy pullover with the Irish Quidditch team logo on it. "Harry
here?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah,
he Apparated into Hogsmeade this morning. Can Luna and I trust you
two? Completely?" Ginny wanted to tell them what Jonathan was
doing.</p><p class="calibre9">"Absolutely.
What's the matter?" Colin had a worried expression on his face.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Muffliato</em>!"
Ginny whispered at the others around her. She and Luna began the
tale of what they had overheard.</p><p class="calibre9">"Bastards!
Don't they know Harry? My gods, he's gonna be livid! They must
not want to live," Dennis retorted. He looked disgusted and ready
to leap over to the Ravenclaw table.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
Harry is rather miffed. I already told him." Ginny took a drink
of her water. "He's got a plan."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
will there be a showdown?" Colin looked entirely too excited.
"Might make a nice picture for the school paper. 'Randy Cancer
Survivor Castrated by Harry Potter.' Good headline, don't you
think?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Or
how about 'Sex Scandal at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry: What Are They Teaching Our Children?' The<em class="calibre8">Prophet
</em>would have a field day!" Dennis laughed at himself, causing
Ginny and Luna to join him. "Ginny, if you need anything at all,
you can count on us." Colin nodded in agreement.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny,
Luna, Dennis and Colin walked into Hogsmeade shortly before eleven
that morning, eager to see Harry and plot revenge against Jonathan
Martin for being such a bloody prat. When they arrived at The Three
Broomsticks, they looked around but found no familiar face. Rosmerta
greeted them warmly but gave no indication as to whether Harry was
there or not. They grabbed a table by the fireplace and ordered up a
round of Butterbeers.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"He
said he'd be here by now," Ginny complained. "He's never
late. I don't understand; he got here this morning." Ginny sank
into her chair and began to pout.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
he'll be here." Luna rested a hand on Ginny's, trying to
comfort her. Suddenly, they saw wide grins flash across Colin and
Dennis' faces and the girls turned around quickly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Neville!"
Luna sprang from her seat and grabbed him around the neck, nearly
pulling him to the floor. "How is my Baby Brooding Begonia?" He
widened his stance and regained his balance as his face flushed red.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi,
sweetie," he said shyly, kissing her quickly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Neville,
good to see you!" Dennis chirped in, standing to shake his hand
with Colin following suit.</p><p class="calibre9">Luna
pulled another chair to the table and Neville sat between Luna and
Ginny. Luna's smile hadn't faded and she looked like she could
fly, in a Luna sort of way. Ginny was glad Neville surprised her but
she felt quite disappointed that Harry wasn't here. In fact, if
she were truly honest with herself, she would feel very jealous and
irate. Another dark figure stepped up to the table. No one said
anything, and Ginny was sure it was Jonathan. The person cleared his
throat, and Ginny turned around.</p><p class="calibre9">She
didn't recognise him, but he looked oddly familiar. He looked like
he was about Harry's height but that is where the similarities
ended; he had dark brown hair underneath a Muggle baseball cap, a
goatee and extremely dark brown eyes that looked at her with intense
scrutiny. He wouldn't stop staring at her. She started to feel
uncomfortable under the stranger's gaze and shifted in her seat.</p><p class="calibre9">"Did
you want something? I'm waiting for someone, so please leave."
She surprised herself with her boldness, having never spoken to a
stranger like that in her life.</p><p class="calibre9">He
bent uncomfortably close to her ear and whispered, "So nice you
still remember me."</p><p class="calibre9">Her
eyes widened in recognition and she threw her arms around him,
kissing him hard. She parted his lips and increased the fever of
the kiss. He did likewise; exploring her mouth with his tongue and
allowing himself to caress her back with his hands.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi,
Harry," Dennis interrupted.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
pulled away from Ginny, giving her his full attention. She pulled
off the cap and tried to remove his hair.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ouch!
That's my hair, woman!" He rubbed the side of his head. "Don't
even try to pull off the beard." <em class="calibre8">He cut his hair</em>, Ginny
observed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Some
disguise there, love" Ginny mused, rubbing her hand across his
chin. "What's the big idea?" The others still hadn't gotten
over the shock of seeing Harry looking so different. For that
matter, neither did Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah,
Harry, what've you got yourself into this time?" asked Luna.
"You look rather, well… hot." Neville shot her a look that
could throw daggers. Luna quickly rubbed his left ear with her hand
and he quickly smiled, forgiving her with a glance.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks,
Luna…I think. It's for some work I'm doing for the department.
I thought I'd try it out here. I guess it worked," Harry said,
turning toward Ginny. "You like it?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Where
are your glasses?" She missed them. They were so much of who he
was, much like his scar. "Your scar's gone, too! What
happened?" At those words, six other eyes were toward Harry, with
Neville quickly looking down into his lap.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ask
him," Harry nodded towards Neville. All eyes moved across the
table.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
I developed a cream, rather by accident, really, which hides scars
and other deformities for around twenty-four hours. The Department
of Aurors is quite interested, and Harry's my guinea pig, which is
why I came along…to observe and report to Moody. He's anxious to
try it out himself."</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
effing genius, Neville!" Colin looked at his friend with
admiration.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
told you he was a genius, Ginny. Aren't you, Nevvie," Luna said
as she leaned in for a kiss. Dennis choked on his Butterbeer, making
his brother whack him on the back until Dennis nodded his thanks.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks,"
Neville said shyly, trying to avoid his friends' eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Nevvie?
You actually let her call you that, Neville? <em class="calibre8">In public</em>?"
Harry very nearly choked on his own Butterbeer, shaking his head.</p><p class="calibre9">"She's
not supposed to," Neville reminded her. Luna only grinned.</p><p class="calibre9">"Everyone,
I hope you will excuse us, but Ginny and I have some catching up to
do upstairs," announced Harry as he pulled her up out of the chair,
leading her to the stairs and up to the third floor.</p><p class="calibre9">"That
was rather rude of you, Harry," said Ginny as he unlocked the door
and pulled her into the room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Politeness
is not my first priority right now, Gin." He pushed her up against
the wall and held her there with his body. "Do you know what is?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I
can feel what is, you naughty boy."</p><p class="calibre9">"Good.
Will you help me?' He ground his hips into hers.</p><p class="calibre9">"To
a certain point." She fingered his goatee gently, enjoying the
texture.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin…"
He bent down to nibble at her earlobe.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?"
She slipped his leather jacket off his shoulders and let it fall to
the floor.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
drive me crazy. You know that don't you?" Harry unbuttoned the
cardigan sweater she was wearing. His breathing increased.</p><p class="calibre9">"Definitely."
Her hand pulled his polo shirt from his jeans and moved her hands
underneath to caress his chest. "Ooh. What have you done here?"
She pulled his shirt up to reveal defined pectoral muscles and the
beginnings of a fabulous abdomen. She spread her fingers across his
muscles, feeling them tense against her fingers.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh,
I've been working out." He swallowed hard. "I have to get rid
of my frustration some how, you know." He smiled.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
see. And how is that working for you?" She was fascinated by the
chest hair that had increased in volume since the last time she'd
seen him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Terribly.
I dream about you; I can't stop thinking about you; I get so
lonely in that great big bed, Ginny. I miss holding you while you
sleep." His eyes never left hers and she began to feel heat
working its way up her body.</p><p class="calibre9">"So,
then…." Harry stopped her words with his mouth and forced his
tongue into her mouth to pursue hers. She relaxed against his oral
assault and returned his kiss eagerly with equal intensity. His arms
wrapped around her as he led her over to the bed and collapsed onto
it with her still in his arms. Harry rolled to his side, feeling her
shirt and pulling the sweater down her arms and past her wrists.
Ginny opened her eyes and saw a new fire in his eyes. This was going
too fast and she knew that she needed to stop before it got out of
control.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't
say it, Ginny. Please." His eyes darted back and forth between
hers, pleading with her. "I need you, Ginny. All of you." His
hands travelled to her shirt and began to lift the hem ever so gently
and softly.</p><p class="calibre9">Millions
of thoughts ran through her mind as she contemplated what he was
asking of her. The majority of them told her to throw caution to the
wind and let him take her right now, just as he wanted.</p><p class="calibre9">"Can
you just hold me, Harry?" She felt him roll off her as he let out
a tremendous sigh.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
don't know what you want from me anymore, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
want…I…can't do this yet. I told you last time."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
know." They were silent for an uncomfortable amount of time.
"Would you, erm, er, touch me?" She couldn't believe he
actually said that. They'd never done that before.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,"
she whispered. <em class="calibre8">Did I really say that?</em> Her answer came in a
wild look from Harry as he again tackled her mouth and stripped off
his shirt.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
do you think, erm, that I could…" He looked shyly at her as he
breathed short, ragged breaths. "Can I touch you?" She shook
her head in response.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
can take off my shirt, okay?" Her eyes never left his, noticing
the green of his eyes turning darker by the second. "I can't do
anymore right now." He nodded and reached for her sweater, pulling
it off her arms and then helped her lift the shirt over her head. He
loosened the front clasp of her bra and her breasts spilled out
before him.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're
beautiful," he said breathlessly as he looked at her. He stared at
her torso, taking in every part of her. His hand went to his jeans
and she heard him lower the zipper. <em class="calibre8">My gods, what a sexy sound</em>.
She closed her eyes as she felt the bed move and he removed his
trousers, knowing that all that remained were his boxers.</p><p class="calibre9">He
stood and pulled back the covers, telling her to join him with his
eyes. She slid inside and pulled the sheet up against her
automatically. His eyes never left hers. When he reached to pull
back the sheet from her, her jaw started to quiver in anticipation
and a little bit of fear.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
promise me you won't ask me to do anything more." He groaned as
he nodded. Their mouths met and her hands travelled downward, trying
to find their way in anticipation.</p><p class="calibre9">She
drew in a deep breath and slowly pulled his boxers away from him.
She felt the urge to look at him, and bravely pulled back the sheet. <em class="calibre8">Oh my</em>. It stood out, pointing at her, and she kept looking. Her heart
beat faster in anticipation as she moved her hand down his length.
It was warm and felt strong, yet soft, almost like velvet.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
gods," he croaked. He leaned over and kissed her softly, taking
his time.</p><p class="calibre9">She
began stroking him gently, teasing the tip by tickling it, making him
buck his hips at her. Then she wrapped her fingers around him and
started to stroke up and down, following the rhythm of his hips. His
kiss became more desperate and he reached for her nipple and started
to tease it to a hard, pink peak. A moan escaped her lips and she
began moving along with him, increasing the speed and pressure of her
hand.</p><p class="calibre9">"Faster,
Gin," he groaned, sounding like he was ready to burst. She
increased her speed and became a bit braver, sliding her hand down further, bringing another wild moan from his throat. He
gripped her tightly to him and kissed her deeply, probing her mouth
and finally screaming into her mouth.</p><p class="calibre9">He
continued to kiss her as their breathing slowed and traced his hand
along her arm, sending goose bumps all along her arm. She moved her
head to the side and kissed his cheek.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank
you." Harry said, sliding off her body slowly. "I love you,
Ginny. That was bloody brilliant." He reached across the bed for
his wand and quickly cleaned her hand.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
glad. It was rather nice, wasn't it?" Ginny snuggled up against
Harry as he held her.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
could do the same for you, y'know…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
you promised," she reminded him with a raised eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre9">He
smiled at her and twirled her hair around his finger. "And you
choose this moment to listen to me because?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Funny,
Potter." She reached over and grabbed her bra, quickly redressing
herself. "Are you going to stay like that the rest of the day?"
She ran her hands across his naked chest. He leaned into her hands
and kissed her firmly while he ran his hands through her hair. His
body began to react to her again, and she felt powerful.</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
enough, Miss Weasley!" He grabbed her hands and pulled them off
his chest. "Get your mind out of the gutter." Harry leapt off
the bed and grabbed his clothing.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
were there first, you know, dragging me up here with sin on your
mind and lust in your heart." She smiled wickedly at him. "Face
it, Potter, you started it. I was only following your lead."
Ginny watched him as he finished dressing himself and had to hide a
giggle when he had trouble fastening his trousers. She walked across
and stood in front of him, barely touching his body with hers,
teasing him. "What do we have here?' Her hand travelled down
his body, grabbing his crotch and licking her lips.</p><p class="calibre9">"Corruption.
Pure and simple." He opened the door andl ed her out of the room,
stopping at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
are you doing?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Seeing
if they've left. I don't want to give you a bad reputation."</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
I think I already have." She squeezed his backside and giggled.
She peaked around the corner to look for herself. "Hey, there's
Jonathan with Ethan and Ian. Weren't you going to teach him a
lesson?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
yes. I must have something else on my mind. Here, let's go out
the back door and come in the front. Follow me."</p><p class="calibre9">They
went out the side door that was inside the kitchen and stopped in
front of the pub. He put the baseball cap back on and pulled out
his wand. "<em class="calibre8">Normalus Oculus</em>," he said as he tapped his
forehead and then squinted at her. "Is this better?" Ginny
nodded her agreement. He pulled on his glasses and his brilliant
green eyes were back. There was the Harry she loved.</p><p class="calibre9">They
entered the pub, and glanced around, trying to act as if they were
looking for someone.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry!
Nice to see you again!" Ethan stood up, reached for Harry's
hand, and shook it vigorously. Ian did the same. "Remember
Jonathan Martin? He just returned this term."</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi
there," Jonathan said, eyeing Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
could tell Harry was trying to get into his head, and apparently, it
was working since Harry's eyebrows rose and he took on a new
expression. He looked over Jonathan's shoulder and rearranged the
cap on his head.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah.
Have a seat," Jonathan motioned to the empty chair and then gave
Ginny his seat. He got himself a chair from the next table and sat
down. "Nice cap. The Yankees are my favourite team, in fact."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
glanced at the cap, which did not have on that logo when she first
saw him today<em class="calibre8">. Sneaky one, Potter</em>, she thought.</p><p class="calibre9">"Heard
they're the best, and I only like the best." He squeezed Ginny's
shoulder.</p><p class="calibre9">"But
football's really my game. It's the only thing that kept me
going when I was sick."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
are you a West Ham fan?" Ethan and Ian chuckled.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
think you're confused. I was talking about American football, not
soccer." Jonathan glared at Harry. "A much more physical
sport."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
yes, the watered down version of rugby." <em class="calibre8">Score one for Potter,
Ginny thought</em>.</p><p class="calibre9">"A
lot more difficult than flying around on a sissy broomstick after a
little golden ball with wings. No offence, Ginny," he added.
Ginny smiled and nodded. <em class="calibre8">Idiot.</em></p><p class="calibre9">Harry
smiled again. He stopped to smile at Madame Rosmerta as she brought
over their drinks. Raising his Butterbeer in a toast, he announced,
"To sports!" The boys raised their glasses and drank deeply. "I
understand you're into other sports as well, Martin."</p><p class="calibre9">"Not
particularly."</p><p class="calibre9">"Funny,
because I was told you enjoy a game of cat and mouse." Harry's
eyes darkened and he put on his battle face. He tapped his fingers
against his chin and the area around the table became quiet. She'd
seen this look before, when he fought Voldemort, and could tell he
was ready to pounce on the lad. Ginny sat back and got ready for the
show.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sorry,
but I don't quite know what you're talking about." Jonathan
looked nervous and glanced at the other two. By the looks of them,
Ginny reckoned Harry placed a sleeping charm on them and gave it a
nice twist by making them look wide-awake. The rest of the room was
silent from the <em class="calibre8">Muffliato</em> spell. "What did you do?" He
looked scared.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
just want you to know who you're dealing with, Martin. I've
eaten little assholes like you for breakfast and if I wanted to, I
could castrate you right now and no one would notice. When Voldemort
tried to kill me, he gave me some of his powers, Jon, and I still
haven't discovered them all."</p><p class="calibre9">"You
don't scare me. You're just a bunch of hot air, Potter. "
Jonathan's shaking legs gave him away. He was scared out of his
pants.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ever
hear of <em class="calibre8">Sectumsempra</em>?" Ginny's eyes widened, and she
noticed the hair on her arms stand on end.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
is that some stupid little spell you made up?"</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
reached into his pocket, pulled out a photograph, and laid it face
down on the table. "This is a picture of the last bloke who was
unfortunate enough to get in my way and be on the receiving end of
the spell. Too bad for him Snape was no where around and he nearly
bled to death before they got him to St. Mungo's."</p><p class="calibre9">Jonathan
turned the picture over and his face became ashen. He laid it back
on the table, and Ginny peeked at it. It was a picture of Lucius
Malfoy after Harry got hold of him. The slashes across his face
where covered in blood, which was beginning to pool on the ground
beneath him. It showed Harry standing over him, waving Lupin and her
father over to carry him away.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
were a friend of Draco's, right? You were a bit upset you were
sorted into Ravenclaw, right?" Harry glanced down at the picture
and tapped the image of Lucius Malfoy. "Nasty little thing, that
spell. I learned that one from Snape. Ron took care of him. Did
you know Ron's a Professional Quidditch player? He can also have
a nasty little temper. Protective, too." Harry's eyes settled
on Jonathan's face. It was working.</p><p class="calibre9">"A
little possessive, aren't you, Harry? What if the little lady
doesn't like that? Maybe she'll find something a little better.
A little closer."</p><p class="calibre9">"Jonathan,
do you <em class="calibre8">know</em> how many brothers I have?" asked Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"So
what? I can handle a couple brothers." Jonathan was getting
arrogant.</p><p class="calibre9">"Let's
see. What's Bill doing these days, Gin?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
he's Chief Security Officer for Gringotts. Knows lots of horrible
curses." She smiled with pride. "Charlie's living in Sweden."</p><p class="calibre9">"Sailing
the fjords, no doubt," scoffed Jonathan.</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
sorry. He's breeding Swedish Shortsnouts," Harry informed
Jonathan. "His fiancée is a top-level Auror there and
teaches Occlumency and Legilimency, which you obviously don't
know." Jonathan's eyes grew wider, as he must have realized what
Harry had been doing to him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Charlie
gets away with nothing." Ginny added. "Fred and George are the
jokers, remember? They really should be Potions Masters and can
concoct anything to make you swell, break out or otherwise make you
miserable for at least two weeks," Ginny beamed as she spoke of her
favourite brothers. "Oh, yes, and I almost forgot about Dad! He's
the Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic now. Arthur Weasley.
He was the one who signed your visa and school transfer papers. Take
a look if you don't believe me." Ginny smiled smugly at
Jonathan.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
see, Jonathan, I've known the Weasleys since I was eleven years old
and I'm like a son and brother to them. They love me. And I'm
proud to say that Ginny loves me. Therefore, unless you want the
entire Weasley clan and their temper, coming after you, you had
better watch your step." Harry's eyes fixed on Jonathan's, and
even she could see the fear in the younger boy's face. "Keep
your smarmy little hands to yourself, your fucking mind out of the
gutter, and your bloody gambling habit in check and you'll live to
see the end of the school year, okay?" Harry sat back in his
chair, looking rather pleased with himself. "Oh, and by the way,
Professor Lupin was my dad's best friend and a he's werewolf, in
case you've forgotten. So please mind your step in Defence.
Wouldn't want Remus to find you outside in the full moon all alone
now." Harry stood up and took Ginny's hand. With a quick wave
of his hand, he reversed his spells and they headed out the door.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>After
the Hogsmeade visit, life seemed to be getting back to normal for
Ginny. Jonathan was no longer trying to get in her way and his
friends stopped trying to get to her. Harry's threats must have
made the rounds of the rumour mills in the different houses. Even
Sarah Mitchell stopped being annoying. The only things Ginny had to
worry about now were the Quidditch match tomorrow and the fact that
Harry wasn't going to be able to come. She skipped Ron's match
last Saturday and was kicking herself for that decision because at
the last minute, Harry was able to go, and she hadn't seen him
since Hogsmeade.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">She
sat in her favourite window seat of the Gryffindor Common Room
looking out into the dark night, wishing she were somewhere else.
She read Harry's morning note over and over, trying to make the
words change, but they never did.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Morning, Sunshine.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I have some bad news. I can't make
it to the match tomorrow. I've been put on a training assignment
undercover in Wales, looking for some artefacts that some believe are
Horcruxes that belonged to former Death Eaters. Here we go again.
Yippee.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I get to wear Neville's cream again
and will be a blonde for about two weeks. So I won't be able to
send you any letters or Floo you while I'm gone and that just makes
me sick. I'll be all right. I'm going with Shacklebolt and
another Auror trainee, so I won't be alone. I won't know who
else is going until I'm ready to leave. I just hope it's not
Hope Abraham. Remember me telling you about her?"</em></p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
smiled at this. Hope was constantly flirting with Harry. She knew
he lived alone in a big house and that his roommate played Quidditch.
According to Harry, she was a very capable Auror, but a real pain in
the arse.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I don't think I could handle two
weeks with her. If it is a girl, give me someone like Millicent
Bulstrode who is in no way attractive and would rather squash me like
a bug than kiss me. Unfortunately, for me, there aren't many like
Millicent in the program, and I think most of them would give their
firstborn for two weeks with me in Wales. Faced with this situation,
I would almost prefer to be a poofter. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">You guys will do fine tomorrow and I
really hope you kill Slytherin. Ron will be on the sidelines along
with Fred tomorrow so I think the secret will be out by then. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hey, why is Natalie always sending Ron
those little trinkets? Hermione's getting a bit annoyed. The last
one he got was a garter belt. Ron said it looked good on Hermione
and to say thanks. Maybe she and Ron should snog right in front of
her and then she'd get the message, huh? He better not eat or
drink anything Natalie gives him at the match.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hedwig can stay with you since I can't
use her when I'm gone and she really finds Pig annoying. Let her
stay in your room and she'll be a happy little owl. She loves you.
So do I. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">You know what I did? I took out my
memory of us at Hogsmeade and I put it in a Pensieve. Merlin, it's
hot! I only wish I could take the damn thing with me, but I guess
I'll just have to remember it the old fashioned way and make sure
that I bring extra jeans and boxers.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Love,</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre9">This
was the tenth time she read the letter today and it was still the
same. How can he not be here? <em class="calibre8">I hope he's safe and that he
goes with another male trainee.</em> Reluctantly, she got off the
seat and went up to bed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Is
Harry coming tomorrow?" Sarah asked when Ginny made it to their
room.</p><p class="calibre9">"No."
Ginny placed the letter in the drawer and fell unto her bed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Trouble
with you two?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No."</p><p class="calibre9">"Are
you still mad at me? How long are you going to keep this up, Ginny?
I'm getting really annoyed with you!" Ginny turned her
frustration out on the other girl.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">You're</em>
getting annoyed with <em class="calibre8">me</em>? Excuse me, Sarah, how many times
have you tried to get into my letters from Harry? Who asked me,
point blank, if I was having sex with Harry? In front of the entire
school no less?" Ginny was talking fast, and her breath was
ragged. "Sorry that I don't feel like talking to you because I
really don't want you spreading any more lies around about me. I
refuse to be your source of entertainment any longer, Sarah. So just
go fuck off, okay?"</p><p class="calibre9">Sarah's
face grew white and she suddenly burst into tears and ran from the
room. <em class="calibre8">I should feel guilty about making her cry, but I don't.
I feel damn good.</em></p><p class="calibre9">Climbing
into bed, she drew the curtains around her and tried to get to sleep,
but lay fitfully awake for at least an hour. Later, the door of the
dorm opened. Sarah had come back with Enid.</p><p class="calibre9">"Who
does she think she is? She thinks she's so special just because
she's shagging Harry Potter that she can talk to people like that.
I used to like her, Enid, but she's turned into a real bitch." <em class="calibre8">I didn't think Sarah had it in her, </em>Ginny thought</p><p class="calibre9">"Sarah,
I really don't think she's doing that with Harry. She wouldn't
have got so upset if it was true." Enid had always been nice to
her, but Ginny hadn't expected this. "Harry's not that kind of
bloke, either. You should know better and I'm surprised at you."</p><p class="calibre9">"What's
that supposed to mean?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You've
had your eye on him since second year, Sarah, and don't you deny
it! You're just mad she got him first. I know what you and
Romilda did with that Love Potion, and look what happened to poor
Ron. And last year, you were the one who sent him that Valentine
stripper card." Ginny's mouth flew open. <em class="calibre8">So that's who
sent it!</em> He'd taken one look at it and threw it in the bin,
but Ron retrieved it, sharing it with Fred and George. Several
times, in fact. "Now Ron, he's completely different. He's the
one who was groping Lavender in the boys' dormitory!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Ron?
You're kidding?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Seamus
walked in and saw them. Harry is a bit different than Ron; I don't
think he'd do that sort of thing. I thought you knew them better
than that." Ginny heard a drawer open and close, then bedsprings
give way. "I'm going to bed, Sarah. Ginny's right. You are
annoying." The sound of curtains closing ended the conversation.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Saturday
morning brought with it sunshine and puffy blue clouds. Perfect day
for a game of Quidditch. Ginny was surprised to see Hedwig sitting
on her bed, cooing softly at her. The clock told Ginny it was half
seven.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Good
girl," she told the snowy owl. "You miss him, too?" Hedwig
cooed in response. "Are you alright? You look a little sick."
The owl's eyes had a yellowish crust along the edges and she hadn't
been her normal self: no begging for crackers or nipping at her
fingers playfully.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
pulled back the curtains of her bed and brought the owl into her lap,
gently stroking her feathers. Several fell out and drifted to the
floor. It wasn't time for her to moult.</p><p class="calibre9">"Let's
get you to Hagrid." Ginny quickly dressed and carefully wrapped
the owl in a towel and left the dormitory. She spoke softly and kept
stroking her as they went down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
good luck today!" She glanced up and saw Luna in the entrance
hall. "What's wrong with Hedwig?" Luna followed Ginny outside
and down the hill to Hagrid's hut. Luna banged on the old, oak
door loudly until the half-giant answered.</p><p class="calibre9">"'Ello
Ginny, Luna. Wha' brings yer down 'ere this fine mornin'?" He
looked down and saw the owl in Ginny's arms. "Is tha' Hedwig? She
doesn' look right fit, do she?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I
think she's sick. Look at her eyes. She looks tired and she's
been acting all funny. Not at all herself." Ginny's voice kept
getting higher as she spoke.</p><p class="calibre9">"Wha'
does 'arry think the problem is...Err.Where is he?" Hagrid said
in sudden realization. "He should be 'ere."</p><p class="calibre9">"He's
in Wales. She's staying with me until he gets back. Hagrid.
You've got to do something!" Ginny pleaded. She handed him the
owl, which looked as if she'd gotten much worse, and Luna put her
arm around Ginny, trying to comfort her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Alrigh'
now, Hedwig, what seems ter be the trouble?' He looked into her eyes
and reached for a container from the cabinet. He scooped out some
cornmeal and fed it to her from his hand. "She'll need ter stay
here for a while, I reckon, Ginny. She needs a good dose a
Patterson's Owl Oomph, if I'm no' mistaken."</p><p class="calibre9">"Hagrid,
what's wrong with her?" asked Luna. Ginny was still crying.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don'
know fer sure, but I reckon…" He sniffed and blew his nose into
his handkerchief loudly.</p><p class="calibre9">"No!
She can't! I can't tell Harry she's dying! There's no way
to reach him!" She collapsed onto the big chair. "Wait! Maybe
he hasn't left yet!" She ran over to the fireplace and threw
some black powder into the grate. "Harry Potter's!"</p><p class="calibre9">Harry's
bedroom came into view. "Harry! Harry! Are you still there?"
She looked around the room frantically. The bed was unmade, piles of
dirty clothes were lying on the floor, and a half-eaten sandwich was
still on the table in front of the fire. <em class="calibre8">He's such a slob</em>.
The doors opened, and Ron came in.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!
What's wrong? Is everything okay?" He looked as worried as she
did.</p><p class="calibre9">"Is
Harry there?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
he just left. What's the matter?" Hermione came into view
wearing her dressing gown and stood next to Ron.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!
What happened?" Hermione looked surprised to see Ginny in the
fireplace.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hedwig's
sick and she might…" She couldn't say it.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?
Oh, shit. Hermione, can you talk to Ginny? I'll go to the
Ministry and see if he's left already." Ron bolted from the room
and headed downstairs. A muffled crack signalled his departure.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
it's okay. Hagrid can help her." Hermione tried to sooth her.
"Hagrid?"</p><p class="calibre9">The
only response he gave was a loud blowing sound.</p><p class="calibre9">There
was another crack downstairs and Ron soon reappeared. "He just
left not two minutes ago. Shit. This is not what I had planned for
today. Hagrid, can I take her to Eeylops?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No'
at all. She can' be moved. She needs ter rest." He wiped his eyes
with his big sleeve, his sodden handkerchief now being of little use.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hagrid,
what's wrong with her?" Ron pulled himself together and calmly
sat in a chair.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
I reckon she's a wee bit exhausted and a wee bit sickly, like she's
been put through the wringer. Where've ya lot been sendin'
'er?"?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry's
been sending letters to me every morning." Ginny's voice was
barely noticeable. "Even after school started."</p><p class="calibre9">"London
to Hogwarts ev'ry mornin'! <em class="calibre8">And</em> back! No wonder the poor
thing's plumb wore out!" Hagrid looked beside himself, and Ginny
felt sick to her stomach. "'arry should know better 'n tha'!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
fine, it's entirely my fault. Okay?" Ginny answered while Luna
went over to her.</p><p class="calibre9">"At
least she'll be here for a couple weeks, Ginny. She won't have
to go anywhere, right? You can't send him any letters anyway."
Luna gave her a tissue from her pocket and Ginny blew her nose.</p><p class="calibre9">"'Tha's
right, Luna. Hedwig'll ge' some rest and she'll be back to normal in
no time." He patted Ginny on the head, causing her to stumble.
"Ron, I 'ear yer comin' to the match."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah.
What'd you need?" He looked mildly distracted.</p><p class="calibre9">"Go
ter Eeylops and tell 'em she's exhausted and let 'em know wha's
happened to 'er. They should 'ave summat for 'er."</p><p class="calibre9">"Sure,
no problem. I'll see you later, Hagrid. Ginny, we'll be there
in an hour, okay?" She nodded at her brother, and the connection
closed.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>In
the locker room, Ginny sat quietly on a bench, trying to pull herself
together. She stared at one of Hedwig's feathers, clenched tightly
in her hand and twirled it around. A tap at her shoulder caused her
to jump and she saw that it was Hermione. She turned around and
hugged her.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
it's not your fault. Hedwig will be fine; all that travelling was
bound to catch up with her. Harry should've known better."
Hermione stroked Ginny's hair, much as Mrs. Weasley had done when
Ginny was little.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
know." Ginny let out a heavy sigh as the rest of the team entered
the locker room and, suddenly, there was lots of noise as Ron, Fred
and George joined them. There was a lot of chest bumping and
high-fives, which gave Ginny a good reason to smile.</p><p class="calibre9">Ron
began a rousing speech to the team, who was there to witness his
performance last weekend, and talked about Gryffindor bravery,
tradition and hard work. <em class="calibre8">I really hate his speeches</em>, she
thought to herself. <em class="calibre8">Hermione must have been really good this
morning.</em> She was in a much better mood when the team entered
the stadium to the cheers and jeers of the crowd.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
mounted her Firebolt Pro and took off into the sky, taking note of
the words of the new commentator.</p><p class="calibre9">"And
there goes Ginny Weasley, Gryffindor Seeker, on the new Firebolt
Pro!" It was the voice of Ethan McClelland. "Mighty fine broom
she's got there , a present from Harry Potter." At
those words, cheers and boos rang through the stadium. "Blimey,
will ya look at that. Looks like Gryffindor had a little help from
the Weasley brothers." Ginny spun around and saw Ron, George and
Fred waving to the crowd and taking their bows, acting like the kings
of Quidditch.</p><p class="calibre9">She
was rather surprised at finding Ethan there, but didn't have time
to pay attention anymore as Madam Hooch began the match.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
took her frustrations out on the Slytherin Seeker and high-tailed it
around the pitch, leading him around. His broom was no match for
hers and she left him in her wake. <em class="calibre8">This feels so good</em>, she
thought. <em class="calibre8">I feel like I'm miles away from everybody</em>. She
slowed to watch the action below her and caught sight of Gryffindor
scoring four times.</p><p class="calibre9">"Good
save by Dennis Creevey. I bet Ron taught him that trick!"</p><p class="calibre9">She
smiled to herself and narrowly missed a Bludger hit by Arthur
Bulstrode, Millicent's brother. He scowled at her and tried to
hit it back at her but received one from Jimmy instead.</p><p class="calibre9">After
three hours of playing cat and mouse with the Snitch, Ginny finally
ended the match, giving Gryffindor a three hundred-forty to one
hundred ten victory over Slytherin. Landing softly on the grass, she
was encircled by her team and most importantly, by her family, that
came out especially for the match. It was actually the first time
her mum had seen her play, and she was warmed by the look of pride in
her mother's face.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
Remus gave you permission to have dinner with us in the village, so
when you've cleaned up, we'll be waiting," said her mother,
wearing her old Gryffindor scarf that looked like it had seen better
days. She leaned over, gave Ginny a kiss, and joined the rest of the
family.</p><p class="calibre9">As
Ginny walked toward the changing room, she felt the presence of
someone behind her. She turned around and there was Jonathan. His
sudden appearance, surprisingly, didn't cloud her good mood at all
.</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
some good flying, Ginny," he said to her. "Did Potter really
give you that broom?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
thank you. How've you been?" She was so proud of the way she
acted towards him this afternoon.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
all right," he said, stopping her by the arm. "I'm sorry for
the way I acted towards you. I let them goad me."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really.
Well, I still don't trust you, Jonathan, and I won't let you
mess up my life."</p><p class="calibre9">"How
could I do that? I really like you, Ginny…"</p><p class="calibre9">"And
I'm very much involved with Harry. Is it so wrong to try and be my
friend?" She started walking again.</p><p class="calibre9">"To
tell you the truth, I've never had a girl as a friend before. It
gets too complicated." He jammed his fists into his pockets. "And
I'm not really enjoying it here, either."</p><p class="calibre9">"Why
not?" For the life of her, Ginny didn't understand why she was
having a casual conversation with this fellow.</p><p class="calibre9">"Frankly,
I'm scared that every time I try to ask a girl out, she'll sick
her plethora of brothers on me and I'll be toast in no time." He
laughed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sorry
about that, but it is all true, Jonathan." She couldn't help but
smile. "What did you mean by toast anyway?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
sorry. Er, they'd have my bollocks."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah,
I guess that would describe their reactions. Surely, there must be
some other girl you fancy." They stopped walking. "I mean Sarah
Mitchell is quite taken with you, and I think Demelza is, too."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
don't think so. Sarah is, well..." He paused to collect his
thoughts. "She's a bit of a daft bird."</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
spot on, Jonathan. Lift doesn't go all the way to the top."
Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre9">"So
where is Harry?" She sighed, rolling her eyes, thinking <em class="calibre8">What
are you up to now?</em></p><p class="calibre9">"He's
on assignment in Wales. He left this morning."</p><p class="calibre9">"He
really missed a good one. Hey, are you going to the Solstice
Celebration?" She'd forgotten about it.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
pretty sure I am. I haven't asked Harry, though." She smiled at
the thought of dancing with him in the Great Hall all decorated up
for the holidays. It was her favourite time of year.</p><p class="calibre9">"Didn't
you know it's for students only? You can't bring guests. Not
even the Saviour of the World can attend, Ginny." He cleared his
throat. "Can I take you?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You're
joking, right?" Panic started to wash over her.</p><p class="calibre9">"About
taking you or about Harry not being allowed?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Both."</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
Sorry. The notice was on our board this morning. Wasn't it on
yours?" She'd left the common room in such a hurry with Hedwig
that she never noticed.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
had other things on my mind. Er, listen…I'll see you later."
She went through the door of the changing rooms and threw her things
on the floor.</p><p class="calibre9">Dinner
with her family was a nice change of pace. Ron was reliving every
moment of the match and even Ginny found herself leaning into the
tale, hanging on his every word, even though she had been the only
one playing.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
Remus tells me Jonathan Martin has returned to school." Her father
just had to ruin her good mood.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes."
She didn't want to talk about Jonathan Martin with her family.</p><p class="calibre9">"Poor
boy. I was so relieved to hear that he'd recovered from his, erm
what do they call it, Arthur?" asked Mrs. Weasley.</p><p class="calibre9">"Lucky
Mia?" Mr. Weasley attempted.</p><p class="calibre9">"Leukemia,
Mr. Weasley?" piped in Hermione. He nodded.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
is that, Hermione?" asked Mrs. Weasley.</p><p class="calibre9">She
paused to think. "It's a type of cancer. There are several
kinds, but I really don't know much about it."</p><p class="calibre9">"Where
was he?" asked George. "I remember him a little, but he was in
your class, wasn't he Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
looked up from her chicken, which she had torn to pieces with her
fork. "Before the end of fourth year, he got really sick and his
mum took him to America so his dad, who is a cancer doctor, could
take care of him." She swallowed and tried to remember the rest of
the story. "He was pretty much in hospital for a year, and then he
did one year of school at American Academy of Witchcraft in Wichita,
Kansas. He moved back in July to live with his mother and
step-father, so now he's a year behind me." The others either
nodded their heads, acting as if they knew what cancer was, or simply
had a blank look on their faces.</p><p class="calibre9">"Is
he a nice boy?" asked Mrs. Weasley.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sort
of. He's a bit pushy." She stabbed her roast chicken with a bit
too much force.</p><p class="calibre9">Ron
grabbed her fork. "What did that chicken ever do to you? What's
the matter?"</p><p class="calibre9">"It's
a long story. Jonathan has just been helping to spread rumours about
me and keeps asking me out every few days." She put her napkin
over her half-eaten chicken and pushed the plate away. "So I
really don't feel like talking about it."</p><p class="calibre9">"What
did he do, Ginny?" George was starting to sound a bit like Harry
now. "What's he been saying?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
stared at her brother. "There's no need for you to worry about
me. Harry had a little chat with him during the Hogsmeade visit, and
he got the message, okay?" She looked from George to Fred and then
to Ron. "You're not the only ones that want to take care of me."</p><p class="calibre9">"But
just not the same way as Harry," argued Fred.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fred!"
scolded Mrs. Weasley.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum,
it's true! Harry told me how they…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Shut
it, George!" Ginny screamed, turning red. "For Merlin's sake,
shut up!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Now
that's enough! Both of you!" Ginny had never heard her father
speak in that voice before.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,"
her mother began, "is there something that you and I need to talk
about? I would have hoped we could have that conversation somewhere
else." Fred and Ron snickered under their breath, receiving their
own look of disapproval.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
fell against the back of her chair with a huff, shaking her head and
thinking, <em class="calibre8">Some days I really wish I was an only child</em>.</p>
