Chapter Ten<br class="calibre6"/>
<em class="calibre8">May</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Through
the remainder of April, Sarah stayed at St. Mungo's undergoing
treatment for her depression and suicide attempt. Her absence, while
refreshing for Ginny, weighed heavily in the minds of the
seventh-year girls. Sarah, for the most part, had always been a
bubbly person and her eternal good mood was often contagious,
sometimes even cheering Ginny up when no one else could.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">But
there was no time to really miss Sarah. Ginny and the rest of the
seventh-year students were occupied with the upcoming NEWT exams at
the beginning of next month. Most of Ginny's free moments were
split between classes, studying, and Quidditch practice. All the
time spent on such activities began cutting into her sleep. It was
not an odd sight to find Ginny taking a nap during one of her free
periods.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
was asleep one Tuesday afternoon when the large door to the dormitory
opened loudly, followed by heavy steps crossing the room. Sitting up,
Ginny rubbed her eyes and resigned herself to the fact that she would
miss her daily nap.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sarah?"
Standing a few feet from Ginny's bed was a very different Sarah
Mitchell. Sarah's usually shiny dark, chocolate hair was dull and
hung limply against her shoulders. Ginny noticed that Sarah had lost
weight as well. "Sarah, what are you doing here?"</p><p class="calibre9">Sarah
turned around and Ginny was shocked by the other girl's appearance.
Sarah, who took great pride in her appearance and wore make up on a
daily basis, looked extremely tired and her skin was sallow and
colourless. Her bright blue eyes, heavily lidded, had lost all their
sparkle. "Ginny, oh, I didn't see you there."</p><p class="calibre9">"Are
you back at school?" Sarah shook her head slowly.</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
I'm going away for awhile, Ginny, with my mother," Sarah said
softly and opened the drawers of her bedside table to remove her
belongings. "Mum's taking me to Majorca. I have a lot of
things to work out." The fire was gone from Sarah, leaving Ginny
with a sunken feeling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sarah…er,
what happened, you know, last month?" Ginny didn't think she
would ever get the image of a barely breathing Sarah lying on the bed
after taking the poisonous potion out of her mind.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
first off, Ginny, thanks for finding me. I, er, was a bit out of it,
you know, and had a hard time dealing with things." Sarah sank
heavily onto the bed behind her and let out a heavy sigh.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
heard about your father, Sarah. I'm sorry, I didn't know,"
Ginny softly told Sarah, and got up to sit down next to the other
girl. "He was sick?" Sarah shook her head and began tugging
at her jumper and balling it in her fists.</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
He was fine. And that's what's so unfair," Sarah whispered
in a low voice, one Ginny hadn't heard before. Ginny watched as
Sarah got off the bed and began pacing at the foot of her bed. "We
were in Glasgow for Christmas, and he was going to cross the street
to get to the train station and was hit by a car."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
my goodness, Sarah! That's terrible!"</p><p class="calibre9">"He
was hit pretty hard and died at the hospital," Sarah choked out.
"Mum didn't trust the Muggles and we took him to St. Mungo's."
Sarah sniffed the tears that were heavy in her eyes and trailing down
her cheeks. "They couldn't do anything for him there."
With a rare display of emotion, Ginny found herself crying as Sarah
went on to explain about her father's injuries and the resulting
funeral. But the one thing Ginny still couldn't understand was how
Sarah would want to do something like that to herself.</p><p class="calibre9">With
a deep breath, Ginny went on to ask Sarah that very question. "But
Sarah, why did you do that?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
could sense Sarah's trepidation at the prospect of answering the
question, and Sarah's head fell to her chest.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
I miss him so much. We were so close, and we did everything together
when I was at home. Mum worked while Dad stayed and taught us at
home," Sarah began with a tiny smile on her face. "He
taught me how to play the piano. He was actually very good, you
know." Sarah's eyes lit up at the memory she was sharing with
Ginny, who continued to listen to Sarah as she described her father
in loving terms.</p><p class="calibre9">Mr.
Mitchell, Ginny learned, was much like her own father. He was a
gentle man with a great love for life and especially his family. Even
though he was a pureblood wizard, he preferred to live among Muggles.
He had many Muggle friends who merely thought that he was a modern
man, choosing to stay home with his children while his wife went to
work. By the time Sarah finished talking about her father, Ginny
realised, with tremendous guilt, that she hadn't really got to know
Sarah in all the years they'd lived together.</p><p class="calibre9">Sarah
had finished talking about her father and looked seriously at Ginny.
"Ginny? I want to tell you something."</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay…"</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
sorry. I'm sorry for everything I said about you and Harry. I
should have known better." Sarah looked at Ginny with pleading
eyes. "I always wanted to be you. You have brothers who love
you, and I was stuck with snotty sisters." Ginny let out a
little snort. Sarah was right. Her sisters Caroline and Beatrice were
some of the most arrogant and self-centred girls Ginny had ever met.
"I suspect I'm really not the best Gryffindor there ever was."</p><p class="calibre9">"Sarah,
no, you're wrong. There are much worse examples of a Gryffindor."
And for the first time in seven years, Ginny gave Sarah Mitchell a
hug.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
began pacing back and forth in the changing room as she and the rest
of the team prepared for their final Quidditch match of the season.
It wasn't just any other game, either. It was for the Cup. They
were playing against Ravenclaw again, and the two teams were neck and
neck for the championship. While Ginny had been in this position
before during the year Harry was captain, she was more nervous than
ever. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already stopped by to say hello
and wish her luck. Fred and George had sent her a new set of goggles
for the match, but she refused to wear them, fearing that they had
done something to them. And to her surprise, Charlie and Bill were
also in attendance. Ginny was happy her brothers were here, of
course, but their presence added more pressure than she was prepared
to handle.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny's
thoughts were broken by Demelza clearing her throat in an attempt to
get the team's attention. The room grew quiet and everyone turned
toward their captain.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay.
We've practised hard and we're ready, I know it. Dennis, make
sure you keep an eye on the left goalpost. You've been letting in a
lot of goals on that side." Dennis nodded. "Jimmy and
Charlie, their Chasers are wicked fast so you have to keep the
Bludgers going. If you have to knock 'em off their brooms, fine. We
need any kind of advantage. Adam and Natalie, we'll be using those
formations we worked on for the last couple of weeks and remember,
Adam, I am the one calling out the formations. Not you."</p><p class="calibre9">"Right,
cap'n. Sorry about the last match." Demelza and Adam had got
into a fight because Adam kept ignoring Demelza's called formations
and going off on his own.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
you've been doing great all season. Just catch the damned Snitch as
soon as you can. I don't trust Baker and Busby." Baker and
Busby were the Ravenclaw Beaters. Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre9">The
team gathered in a circle, hands in the middle, ready to chant.</p><p class="calibre9">"Bravery.<br class="calibre6"/>
Strength.<br class="calibre6"/>
Honour.<br class="calibre6"/>
Go
mighty Gryffindor!"</p><p class="calibre9">The
team chant was a little cheesy, but it was a good way to get everyone
focused and ready for the match. Demelza led the way out the changing
room, and the Gryffindor team headed out onto the pitch, ready to
defend their title. Once out on the green grass, they mounted up and
took off into the blue May sky as Ethan McClelland announced the team
in his usual fashion. Although, he was a bit more enthusiastic
announcing the members of his own house team. Madam Hooch released
the balls and with a blow of her whistle the match began.</p><p class="calibre9">While
the weather was perfect for Quidditch when the match started, clouds
gathered after an hour and a half into the match. Ginny was having a
particularly trying time during the match. Tom Baker and James Busby,
the Ravenclaw Beaters, constantly harangued Ginny, blasting the
Bludgers at her one after trying several times to knock her off her
broom. Ginny had the distinct feeling that they were so persistent
because she'd been the cause of Ravenclaw's last defeat two years
ago. Ravenclaws were smart without a doubt, but they were also
logical and excellent strategists. Their tactics didn't really
surprise Ginny. After all, Ron was her brother, and he wasn't the
only one who was good at playing chess.</p><p class="calibre9">After
an hour of flying in the dark clouds, Ginny finally got a good look
at the Golden Snitch and plotted out a path to avoid the opposing
Seeker. She weaved in and out, careful not to make it obvious that
she'd seen it. When she was certain she could make her final drive,
Ginny leaned into her broom urging it on as it built up speed. Out of
the corner of her eye, Ginny saw the speeding form of the Ravenclaw
Seeker come up quickly behind her and Ginny made a quick decision.
Knowing that the other Seeker was a gullible git, Ginny dived for the
ground and saw that her tactic had worked; she was being followed.</p><p class="calibre9">The
roar of the crowd filled Ginny's ears as they figured out what she
was doing while the ground came increasingly close. She knew it was
time to begin pulling up, hopefully causing her opponent to crash
into the grass. What she didn't expect was the Bludger that came
out of nowhere, colliding with the back of her head and sending her
tumbling onto the pitch.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
felt the pain in her head and heard a buzzing in her ears, which
muffled something like the sound of voices. She willed her eyes open,
and when they did all she could see was the high stone ceiling of the
Hospital Wing. Her left ear hurt, and all she could hear out of it
was a constant ringing that would change into an irritating buzz.
Taking a deep breath, she turned her head to the side and noticed
something that made her smile. Harry lay there, with his head at her
feet, sleeping with his glasses clutched in his hand. His other hand
was stretched toward her, and she instinctively knew that at some
point he'd been holding her hand. Her heart ached at his simple
declaration of love.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny's
eyes moved across the room to find her parents leaning against each
other in a pair of easy chairs. Her dad had his arm around her
mother, and her head lay gently on his shoulder. Oh, how she wanted
that some day. To know that the one you loved would always be there
to support you and try their best to make life as wonderful as it
possibly could be. Her eyes again went to Harry, and then she knew.
She had that which she wanted with Harry. All she wanted now was to
hold fast to that feeling and never let it go. She knew that she was
still very young, in the eyes of the rest of the world, but she knew
in her heart of hearts that no one but Harry would complete her the
way he did.</p><p class="calibre9">She
rolled to her side and took Harry's outstretched hand in hers,
stroking the flesh on his hand. His eyes began to flutter, and she
watched as he opened his eyes to her and smiled.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin…Ginny…"
Harry spoke in the middle of a yawn. "Hey, you're up." He
lazily put his glasses back on his face and scooted up the bed to sit
next to her, taking her hands in his. "You scared me, love.
Don't ever do that to me again!" Ginny couldn't help but
notice the way his voice caught in his throat, as if he was trying to
keep his emotions in check.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
it's okay." Ginny reached out and wiped the stray tear that
had drifted down his cheek. "I've been hurt in matches
before."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
suddenly looked very serious. "Gin, it's bad." Ginny's
smile faded at Harry's tone. "First, you've got a
concussion. You probably knew that." Ginny nodded. Harry sighed
heavily and looked down at the stark white sheets. "You've got
a skull fracture, but Madam Pomfrey fixed that. And, uh, you might
have some hearing problems."</p><p class="calibre9">"Might?
Doesn't she know?" Ginny's eyes were wide with panic and she
felt her heart race. "Bloody hell, Harry. What the hell
happened out there?" She looked over at her parents as her
father shifted himself in the chair and let out a loud snort. "Harry,
the last thing I remember was heading into a dive."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
pulled Ginny closer to him and took her hands again. "Well, one
of the Beaters sent a Bludger at you, and it hit you in the back of
the head."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
know that, Harry!" Ginny hissed.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
may have trouble hearing and, uh, well there may be some other
problems that we don't know about yet." Ginny could barely hear
him, but she knew enough to know that her career as a Healer was in
jeopardy.</p><p class="calibre9">"No,"
Ginny whispered, frowning in disbelief. Everything she'd been
planning for could now be lost, and she'd be left with nothing but
a cracked skull. <em class="calibre8">What am I going to do now?</em>
"How are we going to fix this, Harry? What if I lose my hearing?
What if…what if something else happens?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Whatever
it takes, I'll make sure that you get the best care. I'll take
care of everything, I promise." Harry's face was full of
concern and a bit of fear. Her heart broke as she continued to listen
to him. "You'll have the best Healers in the Wizarding world,
and the best Muggle doctors if we need to. Ginny, don't give up."
Tears began falling down his cheeks as he put his arms around her,
the two of them comforting each other with soft caresses.</p><p class="calibre9">All
too soon, a stabbing pain erupted in Ginny's temple and she
screamed into Harry's ear before falling back onto the bed. Her
ears were ringing, and her head felt as if she was being stabbed with
an ice pick. She could hear Harry yelling out for help and the sound
of footsteps across the floor of the Hospital Wing underneath the
buzzing of her ears before it drowned everything else.</p><p class="calibre9">Opening
her eyes wide, she saw her parents and Madam Pomfrey surrounding her
bed and Harry holding her shoulders down to the bed. She couldn't
hear what the four of them were yelling, but she could tell that the
old matron was bewildered by her condition just from the look on her
face. She watched helplessly as her mother had to be removed from the
room by Tonks, who Ginny didn't even know was there.</p><p class="calibre9">"What's
going on!" she shouted at the others, desperate for an answer.
Harry answered her, but she couldn't hear the words.</p><p class="calibre9">Madam
Pomfrey returned with a tankard of steaming liquid and motioned for
Ginny to drink it. She sat up and reached for the pewter container,
lifting it to her lips. It was a thick, purplish liquid that tasted
worse than it smelled. She thought she tasted something like molasses
mixed with bile in it, but decided not to decipher the ingredients.
When she had finished, the ringing subsided and she began to hear
bits and pieces of the conversation before drifting off to sleep
again.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Orange
light filtered in through Ginny's eyelids the next time she woke
up, telling her it was early morning. She allowed her eyes to open
and found Harry's spot on her bed empty. She was hoping he'd
still be there. Ginny rolled to her left side and was pleasantly
surprised with what she saw. He was asleep on the bed next to her,
his mouth open and a soft snore coming from his throat. She held back
a giggle and continued to watch him.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Harry,"
she whispered. "Harry, wake up." He didn't move. She
found a Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Bean on her bedside table and
tossed it at his head, hitting him right above his ear.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gi..awh…neee?"
he said in the middle of a yawn. "You awake?" He sat up and
ran his hands through his hair, making it stick up most handsomely.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah.
Mum and Dad still here, too?" She couldn't see them anywhere
in the room. "And, why are you still here? Shouldn't you be in
class or something?"</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
stood up and walked over to her bed, standing at her side. "I
sent them home last night. I almost had to hex your mum." They
exchanged a smile. "I've worked it out with my instructors.
You're more important than my classes anyway. I had better get
Madam Pomfrey. She wanted to see you as soon as you woke up."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
kissed her cheek before going to get the matron. Ginny hated being in
the Hospital Wing, and she desperately wanted to get back to the
common room and take a shower. Her teeth felt like they were coated
with wool, and her mouth was dry. Thank Merlin Harry didn't kiss
her on the mouth. She reached for her wand and cast a dental hygiene
charm she'd picked up from Hermione and lay back down on the
pillow, turning toward the bed Harry had occupied and enjoying the
rare silence of the usually noisy ward.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
jumped as she felt a tap on her shoulder, and she craned her neck to
find both Harry and Madam Pomfrey standing over her with worried
looks.</p><p class="calibre9">"What's
wrong?" she asked them. She watched Harry's mouth move, but
heard nothing. "What?" She dug at her ears with her index
fingers and shook her head. Madam Pomfrey's mouth was now moving,
and Ginny still couldn't hear what she was saying. "I can't
hear you! What the hell is wrong? Tell me what's going on!"</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
raised a hand and sat next to her, taking her hands in his. Madam
Pomfrey scribbled on a piece of paper and handed it to Harry, who in
turn gave it to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">We
told you that there would be other side effects, and hearing loss is
one of them.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"How
long will it last?" Pomfrey scribbled again and handed her the
note.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">It's
temporary. It will come back after a fashion, but I don't really
know any more than that. </em></p><p class="calibre9">Harry
began scribbling on another piece of paper, and then handed it to
her.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">You
need to go to St Mungo's. They'll be able to tell us more after
they get a good look at you. Your parents will be here in an hour or
so.</em></p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
looked at Harry with anxious eyes, her stomach churning and her heart
racing. "Harry, I'm scared…" She lost control, and he
took her in his arms and rocked her back and forth as she cried into
his shoulder. He began stroking her hair and she felt herself relax.
She wished she could hear his voice; he could always calm her down
with his loving words, but all she could do was feel his lips move
against her scalp.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The
bright light of the Healer's exam room blinded her as she stared up
at the tiled ceiling while the two wizards studied her brain with
assorted spells and wand motions. Her hearing returned soon after
they arrived at St Mungo's, and she was soon whisked away into the
exam room where she was now being examined.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">The
tap of a wand on the top of her head, a rather sharp tap if she was
truthful, brought her out of her thoughts. She wished that Harry or
her parents were with her, just to have a friendly face. But no, they
weren't allowed. It was one time in her extremely independent life
that she wanted someone there to take care of her. Well, besides
strangers with wands.</p><p class="calibre9">"Now
Miss Weasley, when your hearing fades, what exactly happens? Any
pain, or ringing? Do you feel dizzy?" asked the female Healer as
she came around to look at Ginny. She looked to be in her mid-40s and
had soft brown, curly hair with friendly green eyes. Ginny
immediately liked her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
er, the first time it happened, my ears were ringing and then it
really hurt. Then the next time, the ringing just stopped." She
sighed as she remembered the feeling of not being able to hear. "I
fell asleep after Madam Pomfrey gave me a purple potion."</p><p class="calibre9">The
Healer nodded and motioned for her male associate to come round to
face Ginny. He smiled weakly at her and looked down at the notes
he'd taken down. "Uh, yes. Now, let's see. Is your vision
blurred or anything, miss?" Ginny nervously smiled at the young
man, not much older than herself, addressing her so formally.</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
It's just the ringing and headaches." Ginny nervously played
with the hem of the exam gown she was wearing.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay,
Ginny, that's all we need right now. Do you want me to bring in
your parents as well?" asked the female Healer.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
please. Harry, too." She received a smile as the woman went to
the door and opened it for the others, then ushered them into chairs
across from Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"Physically,
Ginny will be fine. Madam Pomfrey's treatment was correct and
delivered quickly. However," the woman began, "there may be
some residual damage that we can't detect."</p><p class="calibre9">"What
do you mean? Can't magic fix anything?" asked Ginny's
mother, worrying the strap of her handbag.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mrs.
Weasley, to be honest, no. Magic can't fix everything. Take for
instance, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Potter's eyesight." Ginny, her
mother, and the two Healers looked pointedly at the bespectacled men,
making them both shift uncomfortably in their seats. "The retina
is extremely delicate and a spell aimed incorrectly can irrevocably
damage the tissue. The same can be said for the brain." The
Healer got up from her stool and began rummaging through a drawer
across the room, removing a pad of paper.</p><p class="calibre9">"So,
what can we do to help Ginny?" Harry asked, running a hand
through his hair as he kept his eyes focused on Ginny, and gave her a
smile.</p><p class="calibre9">"First
of all, there will be daily analgesic potions for you to take, Ginny.
Those are for the headaches."</p><p class="calibre9">"Do
I have to mix them?" she asked with a chuckle.</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
Madam Pomfrey should have them in the Hospital Wing."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
let out a sigh of relief. Even though she was near the top of her
Potions class, she felt uneasy making medicinal potions at the
moment.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
will also need to rest frequently during the day. Naps between
classes and short blocks of studying should help with the fatigue."</p><p class="calibre9">"You
mean I'll have medical ORDERS to take naps?" Ginny couldn't
help but sound excited, and was almost laughing.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!
This is serious and nothing to joke about," her mother
reprimanded, looking to be on the brink of tears.</p><p class="calibre9">"Molly,
Ginny is taking this seriously. She's merely finding a silver
lining," Ginny's father reassured his wife with a pat on the
hand.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
it's no laughing matter, Arthur. Our baby is losing her hearing."
She blew her nose into a handkerchief. "How can she be a Healer
if she can't hear?"</p><p class="calibre9">Her
mother's remarks caused Ginny to panic. What if she did lose her
hearing forever? What would she do with her life? She couldn't be a
Healer. She'd worked all year to hone her skills for that future
occupation, and suddenly it could all be fruitless.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
sure there's something that can be done, Mrs. Weasley. Right?"
Harry piped in, looking both worried and optimistic at the same time.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
there is." The Healer smiled. "I know of a noted Muggle
neurologist whom I have worked with in the past and who should be
able to help you out, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">"Muggle!
She'll go to a Muggle doctor in a Muggle hospital to receive Muggle
treatment?" Ginny's father's face it up like a Christmas
tree and was nearly bouncing on his seat.</p><p class="calibre9">"Er,
yes, Mr. Weasley. Is there a problem?" The Healers looked at
each other nervously.</p><p class="calibre9">"You'll
have to excuse my father. He's rather fascinated with the Muggle
world," Ginny informed the Healers while she smiled at her
father. "I have a feeling my father wants to go along with me."</p><p class="calibre9">"But
this is a magical child. Why would a Muggle want to treat her? How do
we explain ourselves? It's just not feasible." Ginny's
mother shook her head. "Last time my husband dabbled in Muggle
medicine, they sewed him up like barbarians!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Mrs.
Weasley, I'm sure she wouldn't suggest it if she didn't think
it would help," Harry said, trying to calm everyone down. "Just
hear her out, for Ginny's sake." Harry flashed Ginny a
gleaming smile, settling her nerves.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mr.
Potter is right. This is for Ginny's well-being. To answer your
question, Mrs. Weasley, this doctor I spoke of will see her because
he is my brother. I'm Muggle-born, and my brother is as fascinated
by my world as your husband is with the Muggle one. They'll get on
famously." The woman's smile reassured Ginny that this was the
right thing to do. "I'll call his office this afternoon and to
set up an appointment, if that's alright?" She received four
nods.</p><p class="calibre9">"But
she'll have to wait awhile to see him then, won't she? The wait lists
are long for Health Service patients, I understand?" Ginny
watched as her father wrapped his arm around her mother, the two of
them exchanging sad smile.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
well, but I'm sure there is…" the Healer began.</p><p class="calibre9">"It
won't be a problem. I'll pay for it. That way they'll fit her in
sooner. I'll make sure that she gets the best care. I promised her
that in the Hospital wing," Harry stated matter-of-factly. Her
mother's jaw dropped and she stared at Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
no. You need that money, and we can't possibly-"</p><p class="calibre9">"I.
Am. Paying for it." Harry got off his chair and knelt in front
of her mother. "Sirius left me more than I know what to do with.
I love your daughter, Mrs. Weasley, more than I thought possible.
Please, let me do this for her."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's
heart constricted from Harry's words, and she wanted to just leap
off the exam table and snog the breath out of him. Instead, she
watched as her mother pulled Harry into her arms, nearly squeezing
him to death. When she finally released him, her eyes were full of
tears and nodded her agreement. Ginny physically felt herself fall
more in love with Harry, if that was at all possible.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Back
at school, Ginny's days became routine, broken up into small chunks
of time. After breakfast, she would go to the Hospital Wing for her
morning headache medication. The headaches, though easing up a bit,
never went away entirely even with the pain medication. Rather than
sharp and debilitating, they were now merely dull and annoying. After
visiting Madam Pomfrey, Ginny had her morning classes, each followed
by a Healer-ordered nap. Most days, she really didn't need them but
she dutifully went to her room. After lunch, it was another dose of
potion, classes, and naps. The evenings were not much different
either.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny
sat in the common room of Gryffindor Tower one Thursday, looking over
Hermione's notes with Colin. She'd a rather incident-free day. No
snapping at the younger students and no tearful outbursts when
Professor Binns spoke about her uncles Fabian and Gideon. Most of
all, the dull throbbing headache had diminished significantly. In
fact, Ginny was beginning to think her trip to the Muggle doctor was
unnecessary.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny?
Hey, you in there?" Colin tapped her on the shoulder, causing
her to jump.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?
What's wrong, Colin?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh,
you kind of spaced out there for a minute. You got a headache?"
While Colin was one of her best friends, she really didn't need to
be coddled by him, either.</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
I haven't got a headache, Colin. Is that supposed to be my excuse
for everything, a headache?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey,
calm down. We were studying, and you just faded there." Colin's
eyes searched hers, as if he were looking for an explanation. "And
don't get snippy with me, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">"Snippy?
You think this is snippy? You haven't seen snippy, Colin."
Ginny stood up from her chair, knocking it down in the process before
storming across the room to the window seat. "Get out of there!
That's my spot!" she yelled at a fifth-year boy and a
third-year girl.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
don't think so, Weasley. We're busy," the boy said and went
back to kissing his girlfriend.</p><p class="calibre9">"See
how she likes snogging this! <em class="calibre8">Mucous Chiroptera</em>!" Both the
boy and girl began screaming, fighting off the effects of Ginny's
hex. Amid the laughter of the common room rang out a sharp, piercing
voice.</p><p class="calibre9">"GINEVRA!"
She turned around to find a very disgruntled Professor McGonagall
standing at the opening of the common room. "What is going on
here?"</p><p class="calibre9">"She…she
cursed us when we… when we didn't get off the win…window seat,"
the boy explained between bogeys flying at his face, arms flailing.
"Geroff me!" Professor McGonagall, with a practised swish
of her hand, performed the counter-curse and the couple was returned
to normal. "That's it, Weasley! I've had ENOUGH of you
screaming down everyone's throat! Get a fucking grip on yourself
and grow up!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Mr.
Goodwin! Watch your language!" admonished Professor McGonagall.</p><p class="calibre9">Goodwin
merely huffed in disapproval. "The hell I will! You know she's
been a loose cannon and I'm tired of it, and so is everyone else!"
He crossed his arms in front of his chest and glared at Ginny. "She's
pissed off half the House lately."</p><p class="calibre9">"Shut
it, Tad! You're being an arse so just get out of my face!"
Ginny jabbed him in the chest with her finger menacingly. She felt
hands on her upper arms as someone moved to restrain her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
calm down," Colin said in a soft voice. "You need to get
some rest, okay?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
turned around to face Colin and found everyone staring at her,
waiting to see what she'd do next. Every face, she realised, she
had made either scream at her, cry, or turn into giant bat bogeys.
<em class="calibre8">What's going on with me?</em> she asked herself. She put her
hands on her hair and sunk down into the chair behind her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Miss
Weasley?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
Professor?" The woman looked worried, and frankly, Ginny didn't
blame her one bit.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are
you going to be alright? Do you need to see Madam Pomfrey?"
asked Professor McGonagall.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
resisted the urge to roll her eyes and answered calmly, "No,
ma'am. I, uh, think I just need to relax."</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
right! You sure do need to relax! Get Potter to shag you…that might
relax you!" Tad Goodwin shouted from across the room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Now
that's enough, Mr. Goodwin! Miss Weasley, I came here to tell you
that Professor Lupin wishes to see you." The woman pursed her
lips together and turned her attention back to Tad. "Mr.
Goodwin, must I inform your mother about your language this evening?"</p><p class="calibre9">Spurts
of laughter ran through the students standing around. It was common
knowledge that Tad's mother was on the Board of Governors and a
very strict disciplinarian. Tad set his jaw and slowly shook his
head. Satisfied with his response, Professor McGonagall placed her
hand on Ginny's shoulder and led her out of the common room.</p><p class="calibre9">The
two of them walked in silence, the clicking of their heels the only
sound as they made their way to the Lupins' residence.</p><p class="calibre9">"Professor?"
Ginny stopped and waited for the older witch to turn around. "What
am I doing here? Have I done anything wrong?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
Miss Weasley, you haven't," Professor McGonagall reassured
her. "Remus and Nymphadora want to help you with some relaxation
for your headaches." With that, McGonagall rapped sharply on the
door and left Ginny waiting there.</p><p class="calibre9">The
door opened, revealing a pastel pink-haired Tonks wearing an
oversized t-shirt and shorts, her belly protruding profusely.
"Ginny!" Tonks wrapped her arms around Ginny and pulled her
into the room. "Are you feeling alright? Headaches not too bad?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
they're getting better. But I just want it all to go away, you
know." The two of them walked into the cosy sitting room and sat
on the sofa together. "Oh, and I keep blowing up at people,
too."</p><p class="calibre9">"Mood
swings? I think I've had enough of those to last for a lifetime
already," Remus said as he entered the room, looking quite
comfortable in lounge pants and a t-shirt. Ginny suddenly felt like
she was either interrupting something or extremely overdressed. "I've
felt like I live with a moody mother Hippogriff sometimes."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
bugger off, Moony." Tonks beamed at her husband and turned back
to Ginny. "So, why didn't you change?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Change
for what?"</p><p class="calibre9">"We're
going to teach you how to relax," Remus told her. "Yoga.
It's about the only time I can get her to shut up most days."
He stopped behind Tonks and kissed her on the cheek while ruffling
her hair. "Minerva must have forgotten to tell you. Dora, you
got something for her?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Come
on, Gin. I've got loads of clothes that don't fit me anymore."
Tonks stood and pulled Ginny into their bedroom, making her feel
quite uncomfortable suddenly.</p><p class="calibre9">Not
knowing what else to do, she sat down on a chair and looked around
the room. A small cot stood in the corner decked out in pinks and
purples and little stuffed toys that she assumed to be lambs and
puppies.</p><p class="calibre9">"Tonks?"
Ginny asked. "Are you having a girl?" The thought of a baby
girl was rather foreign and fascinating at the same time. Tonks came
over to the chair and tossed Ginny some light clothing, wearing a
silly grin on her face.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh
huh. That's why my hair's pink. I can't change it. Madam
Pomfrey confirmed it." Tonks glowed with the revelation, and
Ginny had never seen her happier. "Remus brought that home after
Easter. I think it's ridiculously girly, but he is of the opinion
that he wants to spoil his little girl, given his advanced years and
all." They both laughed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Forty
is not old, Tonks," Ginny pointed out as she began changing her
clothes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
I know that. He feels old, given the fact that James has an
eighteen-year-old son and he's just starting out." Ginny had
never thought of that before. "But I've never seen him giddier
than what he is lately."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
smiled as she remembered the change in her professor's demeanour
over the past few months. He smiled more and even though he still had
his monthly transformations, didn't look nearly as worn out as he
had in the past. Fatherhood was doing wonders for him, and she could
only think of good things to come.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
ready." Ginny now wore a tank top and some stretchy shorts that
came to mid-thigh. As she looked at herself in the mirror, she
realised it was the exact type of outfit that would make her mother
would send her back to her room to change out of, and the type of
outfit that Harry would appreciate in many different ways. "So
when did you learn yoga?"</p><p class="calibre9">Tonks
opened the door and began to leave the room. "Auror training.
Harry will learn it next year. Now come on."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
spent nearly an hour with Remus and Tonks learning how to breathe, of
all things. They spent part of their time sitting on the floor with
their legs crossed and their hands resting on their thighs, palms up.
Another portion was spent lying on her back with her hands on her
abdomen, as she felt herself breathe. Tonks had put on a recording of
waves crashing against a beach somewhere, which managed to soothe
Ginny so much that she nearly fell asleep on the floor of the sitting
room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay,
good job, Ginny." Tonks spoke, waking Ginny from her
self-induced deep relaxation.</p><p class="calibre9">"Wow,
that was great. I think I fell asleep there for a minute." Ginny
stood and stretched her arms above her head.</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
the whole point, Ginny. To learn to relax," Remus said.
"Whenever you feel like you're going to snap at someone, go to
your room and go through the poses we went through." Remus
levitated the sticky mats back into the credenza and walked into the
kitchenette. "You ladies fancy some ice cream? Dora here has
developed a new taste for cherry ice cream with chocolate sauce."</p><p class="calibre9">Tonks
and her belly waddled over to her husband and playfully patted him on
the stomach. "I think you have, too, Moony. I saw the enlarging
charm you had to do on your trousers…"</p>
