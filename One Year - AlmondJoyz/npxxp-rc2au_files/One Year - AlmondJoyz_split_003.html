			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong><br class="calibre6"/>
Chapter Three:<br class="calibre6"/>
<em class="calibre8">October</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Miss Weasley, did you hear me?" Ginny's head snapped up to
see Professor Slughorn standing in front of her, looking rather
annoyed. The rest of her Advanced Potions class turned to stare at
her as well.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Uh, no, sir. Sorry. I was thinking." She cleared her throat.
"What did you want?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I asked if you could tell us the correct procedure for mixing
Polyjuice Potion. We are revising for the test, if you recall,"
said Slughorn, starting to look impatient again. "We are waiting."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
of course," she stammered. She rummaged through her notes and
found Polyjuice Potion but unfortunately had only written: "Ask
Hermione" after the description of the ingredients. Harry had
placed a star next to this particular potion in her book, but had
only written: "Tastes nasty. Remember you need a full moon. Ask
Hermione." <em class="calibre8">So much for help from Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Miss Weasley..." continued Professor Slughorn.</p><p class="calibre9">"It says in my notes to ask Hermione Granger, sir," she told him,
expecting detention. Her classmates snickered and whispered.</p><p class="calibre9">"Unfortunately for us, she is no longer a student here. What does
Mr. Potter have to say?" Ginny flushed with embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
quote 'Tastes nasty. Remember you need a full moon. Ask
Hermione,' end quote. So if I ask her, will I be following the
directions?" She felt her temper rise and began wishing Snape was
still Potions master. He would, at least, have just given her
detention for falling asleep and taken points from Gryffindor.</p><p class="calibre9">Professor Slughorn did not answer as the bell rang to signal the end
of the period. She quickly gathered her things and was the first one
out the door. She was nearly at a run when she ran, smack dab into a
brick wall that was masquerading as a student wearing Ravenclaw
robes. Her books spilled onto the floor. As she bent down to pick
them up, she bumped heads with him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
sorry," he murmured, rubbing his head. "Are you all right?" He
sorted through their books and stood up. "Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah," she said, taking her books.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh, sorry. Jonathan Martin," he said with a smile and her eyes
lit up with recognition.</p><p class="calibre9">"When did you get back?" Jonathan had been gone for over two
years. At the end of their fourth year, he left England for America,
Ginny recalled. He got sick with a cancer and went to be closer to
his father, a Muggle doctor.</p><p class="calibre9">"I came back at the start of term. I'm surprised you didn't
see me; I've been trying to talk to you." He looked nervous
talking to her and kept looking her up and down.</p><p class="calibre9">"Heading in for lunch?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No. I hate the food," he replied with a grimace on his face.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're kidding! It's great," she told him.</p><p class="calibre9">"The food's a lot different in America and I still haven't been
able to eat like I used to." He looked back over his shoulder and
she noticed a smirk develop on his lips. "I think I might lose
about eight pounds before Thanksgiving."</p><p class="calibre9">"What's
that?" she asked. Ginny sat on the bench in the entrance hall and
he joined her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
yeah. It's a holiday at the end of November started a few hundred
years ago. There's a lot of turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing,"
he explained. "Football's a big part of it, too."</p><p class="calibre9">"Football? Sorry, but I don't know what that is."</p><p class="calibre9">Jonathan shook his head. "I keep forgetting. My dad's a Muggle
and we watched football, not British football, but American NFL
football. Most every magic family plays Quodpot over there instead."
Jonathan smiled again.</p><p class="calibre9">"No Quidditch? Really?" Ginny couldn't believe. "Ron would
take that as heresy. He's Keeper for Puddlemere. I play Seeker
for Gryffindor now."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?" Ginny nodded and he smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre9">He has dimples. I never noticed them before. Cute.</p><p class="calibre9">"So how's your team this year?"</p><p class="calibre9">"We have a new Keeper and new Beaters." Ginny shifted her weight
as she spoke to him. But I don't think we'll be as good as when
Harry was our captain."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah, I wonder what he's up to these days." Ginny started to
blush.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well to tell you the truth..."</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!" yelled Natalie McDonald, who was running across the
hall. "Demelza got an owl from her dad and he's got tickets to
Ron's first match for the whole team! She's trying to get
permission from Lupin for us to go. Cool, huh?"</p><p class="calibre9">"That
would be cool if I didn't already have tickets, Natalie." Ginny
rolled her eyes. "Do you think that you could <em class="calibre8">not</em> talk
about my brother all the time?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, sorry. He's just..."</p><p class="calibre9">"I know. Cool." Ginny shook her head as Natalie left. "She's
had a crush on him for what, three years now. She's his biggest
fan. Well, it's my favourite lunch today, so I'm going to go in.
Nice to have you back, Jonathan."</p><p class="calibre9">"Nice to be back, Ginny," he said, still smiling at her.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny joined Dennis and Colin for lunch at the Gryffindor table.</p><p class="calibre9">"Who was that Natalie said you were talking to out there?" asked
Dennis.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh, Jonathan Martin."</p><p class="calibre9">"Forgot he came back. So what's new with him?" Colin asked,
looking through his latest pictures.</p><p class="calibre9">"Pretty much the same. He doesn't like to eat here anymore,
probably still from when he was sick," Ginny replied in between
bites of casserole.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't forget he's a knockout, Ginny!" added Sarah Mitchell.
"I'm surprised you haven't seen him before today."</p><p class="calibre9">"I've seen him. I just didn't really notice." Ginny paid
slightly more attention to her peas and carrots than was necessary.</p><p class="calibre9">"How
can you <em class="calibre8">not </em>notice him? Those dimples, that smile and that
hair have got to be better than a <em class="calibre8">scar</em>!" Something in
Sarah's voice told Ginny this wasn't really what Sarah wanted to
talk about.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">She's
goading you, Ginny, don't pay attention</em>. She had to shake her
head at Sarah, though, and a little smile started to creep up on the
corner of her mouth. Sarah, after all, was one of the fan girls
flocking around Harry during Quidditch trials his sixth year. Ginny
would never forget how she and Romilda Vane tried desperately to get
Harry to "fall for them" that year: putting Love Potions in
Chocolate Cauldrons, flirting with him constantly and drooling after
him like he was a piece of meat and they were starving dogs.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
took a deep breath. "Well, to tell you the truth," Ginny began,
"Harry's a man, and Jonathan's a boy, if you know what I mean,
so why would I want to notice anyway?" <em class="calibre8">There, that should shut
her up.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"So it's true, then?" asked Sarah. Her eyes were glues on
Ginny, awaiting her response.</p><p class="calibre9">"So what's true?" Ginny was getting nervous now.</p><p class="calibre9">"That you and Harry...well, that you guys," she started, "you
knowâ€¦shag." Ginny spit her pumpkin juice all over the front of
Dennis' robes, and Dennis choked on his chips. Colin had to whack
him on the back a few times.</p><p class="calibre9">"Excuse
me?" Ginny was shocked. "Is that why everyone's been coming to
me with all their romantic problems?" Sarah nodded
enthusiastically. "I'm sorry but that's no one's business
but ours."</p><p class="calibre9">"So have you?" Dennis asked this time. Ginny shot him a look
that would have made a lesser friend feel scared for his life.</p><p class="calibre9">"I don't believe this. This is all people can talk about?"
Ginny was shouting. "Why is everyone so interested in my sex
life?" The Great Hall suddenly became very quiet, and Ginny could
feel hundreds of eyes staring at her. She looked up and saw
Professor McGonagall purse her lips together so tightly she could
have bled; Professor Lupin had his hand on his face, covering his
eyes; poor Hagrid's jaw could have touched the floor. Ginny got up
from her seat, leaving her unfinished plate, and left the Great Hall
in a mad dash for the door.</p><p class="calibre9">Up
in her dormitory, Ginny lay crying into her pillow with the curtains
of her bed drawn around her. "Stupid people! Stupid gossip!
Stupid, stupid, stupid! I can never show my face here again."
She started punching her pillow with her fists. She had already
thrown her books around the room and made a great mess of her
bedclothes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny?" someone asked from outside.</p><p class="calibre9">"Go away!" The knock came again. "Bugger off!" Ginny threw
a book at the door and the sound echoed through the room. The
doorknob turned slowly and the door opened, letting in little slivers
of light into the darkened room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, it's Tonks," she said softly. Ginny poked her head
through the curtains and saw her friend standing a few feet from her
with bright orange hair. "Can I come in?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Come in here." Ginny opened up the curtains of her bed, and
Tonks climbed inside, gathering Ginny into a warm hug, letting her
cry and scream and swear. Her crying calmed, Ginny pulled out of the
embrace and wiped her face on the sleeve of her robes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Remus told me," Tonks began, "and asked if I'd come over.
You want to talk?" Ginny nodded.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
want to go home, Tonks. I hate it here. Remus wouldn't let Harry
and me spend any time together when he was here. Everyone gossips
about Harry and I having sex when we're not and begging for
details. I just want to crawl into a hole and hide."</p><p class="calibre9">"What will that accomplish?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No one would have to look at me," Ginny sniffed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Would that change their minds?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Probably not. They'd think I was hiding from the truth."</p><p class="calibre9">"Exactly. Now, didn't Remus explain why you couldn't go to
Hogsmeade?" Tonks asked and Ginny nodded. "Did it make sense?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Now it does. It didn't then," she admitted. "So what am I
supposed to do?"</p><p class="calibre9">"What
did Harry do when all those articles appeared in the <em class="calibre8">Daily Prophet</em>
saying he was, what was it now, unbalanced?" Tonks rolled her eyes
at the memory.</p><p class="calibre9">"He shrugged it off because he knew it wasn't true."</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh-huh. And what did his friends do?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Most of them stuck by him because they knew better." Ginny had
calmed down considerably. "Others eventually came around."</p><p class="calibre9">"Sounds like pretty good advice, doesn't it? And he's not even
here." Ginny smiled weakly.</p><p class="calibre9">"But what do I do until they come around?" Her eyes pleaded for
a solution.</p><p class="calibre9">"Who's your best friend here? Besides me," Tonks asked with a
smile.</p><p class="calibre9">"Luna."</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay, so you go vent to Luna. Then what?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Make sure she's with me for support."</p><p class="calibre9">Tonks nodded. "Then what?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Bat-Bogey Hex Sarah Mitchell for the rest of the school year,"
Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, maybe only until Christmas," Tonks added.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks, Tonks," said Ginny, hugging her.</p><p class="calibre9">"So tell me the truth about you and Harry."</p><p class="calibre9">"We've kissed and groped, but that's about it. He says he's
frustrated." She shook her head, almost laughing at the thought.
"I don't know if I'm ready. I thought I was, but I'm not.
It's a lot to think about." She brushed her hair out of her eyes
and behind her ears.</p><p class="calibre9">"Has he pressured you?" Tonks looked quite serious.</p><p class="calibre9">"No, he hasn't," Ginny replied. "He gets upset when I stop
him, though."</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
he's eighteen. He's a walking hard on." They laughed. "It's
always on his mind and he can't do anything about it. You should
be grateful he's in London, or you'd never get any sleep.
Eighteen-year-old boys are sex machines!" Ginny raised her eyebrow
in question. "I'm not <em class="calibre8">that</em> old! Besides, I prefer the
touch of a more experienced lover."</p><p class="calibre9">"Tonks! Shame on you!" Ginny grew red in the face. "I can't
look Remus in the eye anymore now!" Ginny sighed and asked, "So
what's it like?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I don't shag and tell, little missy," Tonks replied. "Come
on, let's go bother Dobby and Winky and get some food." They got
off the bed and headed down the stairs, taking note of every pair of
eyes that fell on them. Colin came up the stairs and met them half
way.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are you okay?" Colin had a smile on his face. "You missed
it."</p><p class="calibre9">"What'd I miss?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I performed my first non-verbal spell!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey, that's great, but what does it have to do with me?" Ginny
asked.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
did <em class="calibre8">Levicorpus</em>. On Sarah," he informed them with glee.
Ginny hugged him enthusiastically as thanks. "Hey, don't be so
happy. I got a week of detention for that!" Colin was still
smiling at her. "Between you and me, it was worth it, Gin."</p><p class="calibre9">"You
are some kid, Colin," Tonks said, patting Colin playfully on the
head. She continued down the stairs and headed for the portrait
hole.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey," Ginny exclaimed, "aren't we supposed to be getting
some food?"</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>A few days later, Ginny stepped through
the portrait hole and into the Gryffindor common room. A crowd
gathered near the bulletin board; a Hogsmeade visit was scheduled.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, aren't you excited! Oh, I've
missed the village so much," said Demelza. "Are you going to ask
Harry?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
yeah. I've known about this for a while, actually. Professor
Lupin let it slip when Harry was here for Quidditch practice." She
and Demelza sat on the sofa. "It's crazy you know. I hear from
him each morning and we talk once a week, and I still miss him. This
year's going to be rather rough."</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, do you know how many of us wish
we had your problems?" Ginny knit her brows together. "Ginny, I
never believed any of the things Sarah said about the two of you, and
I think it's horrible the way things happened."</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks, that means a lot."</p><p class="calibre9">Demelza lowered her voice. "Did you
know Jonathan Martin has a crush on you?" Ginny raised an eyebrow.
"He is a rather bonnie lad and he's here..."</p><p class="calibre9">"A crush is supposed to make me leave
Harry? Oh, puh-lease," Ginny retorted. "I love him and he loves
me. That's all there is to it."</p><p class="calibre9">"See, he's in a lot of my classes
and he keeps asking about you. I don't tell him much, but he does
hear it from the other Ravenclaws. But most interestingly, no one's
told him about Harry." Demelza bit her lower lip. "So he thinks
you're fair game."</p><p class="calibre9">"Luna's never said anything about
this."</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, you're practically the only
one who talks to her. She wouldn't know anyway. She's just
weird, that's all."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, now she's weird. Nice how
everyone forgot how she was there in the Ministry of Magic with us,
or how she tried to stop Snape and Malfoy from getting away, or that
she was with me, Harry, Ron, Hermione and the others who were down by
the lake fighting that damned Voldemort!" Her eyes flared with
anger at the girl in front of her. "So don't you tell me she's
weird, Demelza, because she's the best friend I have and has shown
more loyalty than most of the people in this room! So please excuse
me because I'm going to be studying with my 'weird' friend in
the library and I think I may just have to stay away from the common
room for a while." Ginny raced up the stairs, grabbed her book bag
and headed out the portrait hole before anyone could stop her.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
and Luna found a table in the back of the library, trying to avoid
all the stares that were coming Ginny's way. <em class="calibre8">Now I know how
Harry felt.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"So what should we start with?
Herbology or Transfiguration?" Ginny's mood had settled somewhat
since meeting up with Luna. "I vote Herbology."</p><p class="calibre9">"Fine," Luna replied. "Although
I'm a complete fiasco. I let my Croatian Cock-Leaf dry up and now
my Pygmy Puff thinks it's his litter box." Her head dropped to
the table with a thud.</p><p class="calibre9">"Luna," Ginny began, "since when
does a Pygmy Puff use a litter box?" A little snicker escaped her
lips.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, they can be trained, Ginny,"
Luna said seriously, having lifted her head at the question. "You
need to make them think you're their mother and show them what to
do."</p><p class="calibre9">"They don't have legs, my friend."
Ginny couldn't help but giggle.</p><p class="calibre9">"You've obviously never shaved Arnold
then." Luna shook her head at Ginny as she laughed. Madame Pince
cleared her throat loudly from the end of the aisle, warning them to
get to work.</p><p class="calibre9">They began looking up information on
mandrakes and wormwood, the plants assigned for the essay, and, after
sorting through their notes, the two girls hit a roadblock.</p><p class="calibre9">"This was so much easier when Neville
was here," Luna said. "He's a genius." Her eyes took on
that dreamy look she got whenever the subject or thought of Neville
came round.</p><p class="calibre9">"I have to agree with you. About
Neville being a great help. But a genius? I don't know," Ginny
replied, rechecking her facts.</p><p class="calibre9">"His grandmother doesn't appreciate
him." Luna took a deep breath. "I'm not sure she likes me,
either. She thinks I'm flighty or something." Ginny had to
stifle another giggle.</p><p class="calibre9">"I know. I'd hate being compared to
Harry all the time."</p><p class="calibre9">"Ronald was. Did he hate it? I
thought he rather liked the attention."</p><p class="calibre9">"That was different," Ginny said,
although she started to doubt that statement now. "Anyway, does
Neville write?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Some," Luna said wistfully. "But
the letters are short and they're all the same. I love you, I love
you, I love you." Luna laughed. "But he's really busy right
now and all. Is Harry sending Hedwig still?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Thankfully,
he doesn't have his class at six anymore, so I get to sleep in a
little while at least. She's been taking a nap after I read the
letter, and she's usually gone by lunch." A shadow came over the
table, causing Ginny to look up at Jonathan. "Hi."</p><p class="calibre9">"How are you two?" he asked them
both, but he was staring at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I
feel creepy</em>, she thought. "Fine. What do you need?" Ginny
went back to her Herbology.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh, Luna, could you excuse me?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
I was here first, Jonathan, and I'd like to get my work done with
Ginny." Her voice lost all its dreaminess, and she started to
sound a bit annoyed. "So unless you know anything about this, you
have no further business here." Ginny smiled at this new Luna<em class="calibre8">.
I guess she </em>has <em class="calibre8">heard about what her fellow Ravenclaws have
been talking about,</em> Ginny thought.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fine, Loony," he said. "Can I
talk to you outside, then?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No. I don't hang around people who
insult my friends." She stared him down and he looked away first.</p><p class="calibre9">"Some other time then." He turned on
his heels and walked toward the front of the library, where he
stopped to talk to two other boys. They kept looking at her as they
spoke.</p><p class="calibre9">"He's cute. But a real pain. Tries
too hard to impress everyone again. He and the other boys talk about
you when they think I don't hear them. Fred gave me Extendable
Earsand they are so very helpful. But they stole the idea from
Ignatius Gropeler, inventor of the Charmed Listening Crystal."
Luna looked at Ginny with complete seriousness. "Father wrote
about it three years before they 'invented' it."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?" Ginny was quite skilled at
skipping over much of what Luna told her, thanks to years of
friendship. "Demelza told me that she'd heard them, too.
Figures. Did you hear about my little outburst?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Who
hasn't? Colin did a nice <em class="calibre8">Levicorpus </em>before I could."
Luna laughed again.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks." Ginny took comfort in the
fact that she had such loyal friends.</p><p class="calibre9">They finished their work and split up,
each headed back to their respective houses. As Ginny was climbing
the stairs to the fourth floor, Jonathan was sitting in the middle of
the stairs, waiting for her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Jonathan..."</p><p class="calibre9">"Just hear me out, okay?" Ginny
looked at him, trying to decide whether she should listen to his
explanation or not. He had bright blue eyes and short, curly brown
hair and was about Harry's height, but a little stockier. She
nodded and he continued. "I'm sorry about that back there. I
just have a problem reconnecting."</p><p class="calibre9">"You seem to fit in fine with everyone
you've been gossiping with about me. So, please enlighten me as to
whether I should talk to you again." She took a firm stance and
was prepared to hex him if the need arose.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fair enough. I know you haven't
seen me since fourth year, but I really missed you; you were always
so nice to me and I guess I had a crush on you. You're very
pretty, Ginny. And smart, too. I heard you're planning to be a
Healer. I just want to get to know you a little better, that's
all." He reached for her hand, and tried to wrap her fingers in
his, but she pulled away.</p><p class="calibre9">"Jonathan,
I have a boyfriend." <em class="calibre8">How can he be so thick? No means no.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"He's not here now is he? You don't
hang out with any boys other than those Creevey brothers, and I don't
think they're your type."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
does that mean that you are?" <em class="calibre8">He's making me feel creepy
again.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"I would like to think so. I'm here,
willing to help you get through this lonesome time in your life,
Ginny." He took a step down to move closer to her and reached for
her again.</p><p class="calibre9">"Jonathan, I'm dating Harry Potter."
His expression seemed to melt. "I have been for quite some time."
She took a deep breath. "We were friends before, Jonathan, and
that's all we can be." She breathed as Jonathan frowned.</p><p class="calibre9">She stared at him, taking in his
expression. He pursed his lips together and by the way his eyes were
moving back and forth, she could tell he was trying to think of
something.</p><p class="calibre9">"You've been gone for over two years,
Jonathan. He's training to be an Auror and he's changed a lot
since you saw him last. So if you really think you can take him on,
go right ahead, because he's dealt with wizards a tad more
intimidating than you." She trounced up the rest of the stairs as
he watched her leave. Turning the corner, she suddenly stopped,
getting the feeling this wasn't yet finished. She knelt down and
rummaged in her bag for her Extendable Ears. Slowly poking her head
around the corner, she saw two other boys joining him on the stairs.</p><p class="calibre9">"So? What happened?" asked Ethan
McClelland, another seventh year she knew from classes. "What'd
she say?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You neglected to tell me she was
dating Potter. That information would have been helpful." He
sounded angry.</p><p class="calibre9">"Didn't want to discourage you, Jon,"
replied Ian Walsh, a tall Slytherin sixth year. "So, come on.
Spill it."</p><p class="calibre9">"She turned me down, flat. I even
tried to convince her to let me take care of her while she was here.
Feisty thing, isn't she?" She didn't like the tone in his
voice at all. "She wasn't like that before. Makes her even
hotter."</p><p class="calibre9">"From what I've heard, she's a bit
of a slag, too. Who'd have thought?" added Ian. "I rather
doubt Potter can keep her satisfied the way she hangs around those
Creevey wankers."</p><p class="calibre9">"Interesting theory, but those two look
a little queer to me," added Jonathan. The three of them laughed.
"Hey, there's a Hogsmeade weekend coming up, right?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You're not going to ask her are
you?" asked Ian. "Bet you ten Galleons, Potter's coming to get
some. He probably has a couple on the side himself. He's got to
have all the girls fawning all over him now, huh?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I think I'll reacquaint myself with
the great Harry Potter and join his fan club." He laughed. "I'll
play along and then convince Miss Quidditch to ditch the hero and get
a little Midwest beef." He gestured suggestively down towards his
crotch. "Make it twenty and you've got a bet, McClelland."
Jonathan stuck out his hand, waiting for Ethan to take the bet.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'll add twenty more if you fuck her
by Valentine's," Ethan said. Ginny's jaw dropped.</p><p class="calibre9">Jonathan raised an eyebrow. "You're
on. What proof do you want?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ian and Ethan looked at each other. "We
want to watch." Ginny clamped her hand over her mouth to avoid
revealing herself and to avoid throwing up, she felt so sick.</p><p class="calibre9">"Done." The three of them shook
hands and headed down toward their own House.</p><p class="calibre9">She couldn't believe what she just
heard. They were betting on her breaking up with Harry and having
sex with Jonathan. Ginny sat on her bag and stared at the portraits
that were shaking their heads at her. She could feel her temper
begin to rise and as soon as they were out of sight, she let out a
scream, receiving some rather nasty remarks from the portraits.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny used four pieces of parchment that
night to tell Harry about what she had heard. She was thinking of
telling him over the Floo, but if Ron overheard, he'd be over here
in a flash. She didn't really want Harry to do anything, but she
couldn't NOT tell him.</p><p class="calibre9">In the morning, her hand still hurt as
she made her way to the Owlery to send the letter. Ginny tied the
letter to the foot of a post owl and sent it on its way. As she
watched the owl fly off into the fluffy white clouds, she couldn't
help think how bad days always seemed to happen to her.</p>
