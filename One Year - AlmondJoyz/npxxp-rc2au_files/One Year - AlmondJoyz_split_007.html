<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_8">*Chapter 7*: February</h2>
			<p class="calibre9">Hogwarts
was all abuzz at the beginning of February. The morning edition of
the <em class="calibre8">Daily Prophet</em> had arrived at breakfast, and the big news
was that the Ministry for Magic had announced that there would be a
gala in honour of the defeat of Voldemort the previous year. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione were to be the guests of honour at the lavish
celebration which was to be held the week before Valentine's Day.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny knew that some things
didn't make the paper. Even though the Ministry tried to palm all
the glory off on Harry, he'd said he wouldn't participate if his
friends weren't involved. His loyalty to them is what changed
their minds. It was that same loyalty and his desperate search for
privacy that caused him to tell Ginny he didn't want her to go. He
was being stalked everywhere he went lately, and he didn't want his
private life on display for the entire Wizarding world to see. She
was thankful for that, in a way. The part of her that held a grudge
was the part that longed to spend time with Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">She felt a nudge at her side
and turned to find Sarah with a goofy grin on her face. "So? Are
you going? I mean you were there. You were part of the defeat"</p><p class="calibre9">"No," Ginny replied
rather glumly. "Harry doesn't want our private life in the
paper." Ginny knew she didn't believe that statement
completely herself and that Sarah would read much more into it than
was necessary.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh really," Sarah
replied, her eyebrow cocked in an expressive arch. She knew better
than to continue pressing Ginny, and instead left the Great Hall to
spread the news of Ginny and Harry's imminent break-up, Ginny was
sure.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't let her get to
you, Ginny. You don't want to be a piece of meat for the press and
neither does Harry," Colin reassured her. "Is he still at
boot camp?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah," she answered.
"He has three days left, and then the damn gala and six days
after that he'll be here for Valentine's." The last phrase
brought a smile to her face. She'd been looking forward to this
Valentine's Day since she left Harry at the gates of Hogwarts after
Charlie's wedding.</p><p class="calibre9">In his last letter from boot
camp, Harry'd told her to make plans for them all day and to see if
Remus would be willing to let her stay out all night. Ginny's
thoughts became rather steamy, imagining what Harry and she could get
up to. Oh, she knew what they could get up to if left to their own
devices, and even though she told herself she wasn't ready to take
that step with Harry, she was making lists of things she did want to
try with him. Thoughts of those activities brought a flush to her
face and an ache to her thighs that didn't go away until she lay in
her darkened room with the curtains pulled around her bed. As the
pleasure she gave herself surged through her body, she closed her
eyes, imagining it was Harry touching her.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"Come in," she
said softly into the dim light of her room. </em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Hey," Harry
automatically said. "Want some company?" A smile played
across his face and she felt her temperature rise. She scooted over,
leaving him a spot next to her.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Don't forget to seal
the door, Harry. The wrath of Molly Prewett Weasley is rather
infamous, remember?" Her laugh echoed in her room as she watched
him cast a Silencing Charm and Imperturb the door. She watched as he
flung himself to the bed and stretched out next to her.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I don't think you
are going to need this right now, Ginny." He took the book she'd
been reading, tossed it aside, and pulled her to him so she was flush
against his body.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Who are you, and what
have you done with my boyfriend?" She tried to frown at him, but
couldn't stop her laugh. He was never this forward. In answer, his
lips met hers softly, reminding her of their first innocent kisses by
the lake that Saturday so long ago. "There he is," she
managed once she broke their kiss. She swept the fringe off his face.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I'll miss you, you
know." He looked so serious in the evening light. His fingers
found their way to her lips and traced the edges lightly before
moving onto her jaw line. Fingers were replaced by lips which slowly
moved toward her ear, making Ginny tingle and arch her neck away from
him, giving him more room to explore her skin.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Harry," she
whispered before she turned to him, kissing him full on the mouth,
and matching his need with her own. She felt a rush of desire in her
chest as she unwrapped her legs from his hips, feeling the hardness
that strained under his pyjama bottoms.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry's hand found its way to
the skin under her shirt and drifted along her side, sending shivers
up and down her spine. He barely touched her, yet could evoke all
these feelings within her. His hands slid to her breast causing her
to gasp into his mouth as they kissed. She knew he loved her breasts;
she pulled away from him and nodded, giving him permission to remove
her shirt. She saw him swallow hard, his Adam's apple bobbing in
his throat. Harry sat back on his haunches and pulled the shirt with
him, exposing her to the chilly air of the room. She could feel her
nipples tighten.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Ginny watched him as he just
kneeled there, looking at her with wide eyes that held so much love
in them. She reached up with her hands and moved them across his
shirted chest and slid onto his shoulders. He took her hands and put
them down before removing his own shirt and lying next to her on the
bed.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ginny…I…I want
you," he admitted, his voice catching on the last words. His
hands began to wander again across her chest, breasts and onto her
stomach, inching closer to the drawstring of her pyjama shorts.</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny lay in her bed, panting
as the effects of her self-induced climax wore off. She bit her
lower lip, wondering why she could so easily do this to herself but
couldn't let Harry see her naked and make love to her? She knew he
wouldn't care that her hips were wider than most, or that she had
freckles in some of the most embarrassing places, or even that she
had bright orange hair between her legs that rivalled the colours of
the Cannons. Punching her pillow in disgust, she turned on her side
and tried to go to sleep.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">A familiar tapping awoke Ginny,
bringing a smile to her face as she saw the snowy owl perched on her
window ledge. The air was cold as she drew back the blankets and
stepped over to the window, letting in the bird.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi, Hedwig. Oh, you're
so cold. You stay in here today, okay?" Ginny reached down and
stroked the silky feathers and kissed the top of Hedwig's head. The
owl lifted her leg and patiently waited as Ginny untied the message
before flying to the top of Ginny's four-poster bed and burying her
head under one of her wings.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Morning, Sunshine.</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Well, tonight is the bloody
gala, and Ron is actually looking forward to dancing with Hermione
tonight. He says he wants to make up for the Yule Ball and be the
best date he can be. Hopefully, neither of the Patil twins will be
around to remind him of what an utter ass he was before.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">You wouldn't believe the
number of offers I've had for dates tonight. I think I lost count
at forty owls yesterday. It was nice that none of them could find me
at home, but Ministry officials are rather perturbed that I had a
slew of them waiting for me in the training room. I've even
received some rather peculiar gifts. Lacy things. They're nice and
all, but I don't think they'll fit me. So I'm saving them for
you. Ron found some of them sitting in my room. He asked me, "Harry,
are you the kind of guy that wants to play for the Harpies? You know
the kind that swings the Beaters' bat the other way?" I kid
you not and you can just stop laughing! I know you are.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">The look on his face was
just pitiful. He really didn't appreciate it when I put my hand on
his shoulder and smiled strangely at him. He nearly ran out of the
room. I don't know how long it will take for him to forgive me for
that one, but it was so worth it. When I finally ended up explaining
to him what happened, he was a bit jealous of the kind of mail I'd
received. I then reminded him of Natalie's latest package in which
she sent him a lacy red bra and a pair of crotch-less knickers, and
that made him shut up.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I'm going to be rather
busy the rest of the month. After the ball (gag), I have three
projects that I have to work on, plus I have another memorial thing
to attend. That one is in Ireland. When all this is over with, I
swear I'm going to shut myself in my house and not come out for a
month. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">So I'll have your dad take
some pictures and send them to you so you will see how desperately
bored I will be. I'll make sure he gets some pictures of Ron
twirling Hermione about the floor as well.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Love, Harry.</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>She folded the letter and
placed it in her now overstuffed drawer with all his other letters.
As she closed the drawer, she remembered that he hadn't mentioned
anything about Valentine's Day and coming up to visit her. <em class="calibre8">Well,
he did have a lot on his mind</em>, she told herself.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">She dragged herself out of bed and
headed toward the bathroom for a quick shower before breakfast. She
began to open the door and stopped midway upon hearing her name
mentioned.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny's not going?
You're not serious!"</p><p class="calibre9">"She told me herself. He
doesn't want to 'put her on display.' I'd say they'll be
finished soon. With all the time they spend away from each other,
it's no wonder."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh come on, Sarah. They
spent all that time in Sweden together for her brother's wedding.
They must have enjoyed that," Demelza chirped.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, they could just be
staying together for the sex, you know." Ginny never hated Sarah
Mitchell more than she had at that moment.</p><p class="calibre9">"You still think they do
that? Even after what happened in November?"</p><p class="calibre9">"He's a man, Dem. How
can he not want it? If she's not having sex with him, someone else
is." Ginny let the door close and decided she'd rather do a
Cleansing Charm than take a shower today.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Miss Weasley!"
Ginny's head popped up at the sound of Professor McGonagall's
angry reprimand. She heard the laughter around her and she soon
discovered that her mouse was ticking rather than squeaking, and
rather loudly, too. "Miss Weasley, would you please stay after
class?" Ginny nodded. "I didn't hear that."<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Yes, Professor."</p><p class="calibre9">"Now, kindly fix your
mouse."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's gaze fell back on her
mouse, and noticed that the tail had turned into the hand of a watch.
She slapped her forehead with disgust, realising she had
incompletely transformed her mouse into a watch.</p><p class="calibre9">Standing at the teacher's
desk after class was not the most exciting of prospects Ginny had
ever encountered. She knew Professor McGonagall was angry with her
and prepared herself for the worst. Since coming back from Sweden,
her performance in her classes had decreased significantly.</p><p class="calibre9">Professor McGonagall turned around,
treating Ginny to her pursed lip expression which meant any number of
things.</p><p class="calibre9">"Now, Ginny, I have heard
some rather disturbing news about you." She crossed her arms in
front of her, and all Ginny could do was to open her mouth in
disbelief. <em class="calibre8">What the hell happened now?</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Pardon? Excuse me, but I
have no idea what you are talking about." Ginny shifted
nervously back and forth on her feet.</p><p class="calibre9">"I have heard from several
students that you have been sneaking out to the village and meeting
Mr. Potter for, how can I say this, relations," said McGonagall,
looking highly uncomfortable.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, that's not true
at all. Any of it." Ginny felt her blood begin to boil and tried
to calm herself in the coming tide. "Who told you? Sarah?
Romilda?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Miss Weasley that is not
the point. I want to get the bottom of your behaviour, and Mr.
Potter's."</p><p class="calibre9">"Will you please listen to
me?" The older woman nodded. "I swear I have NOT been
sneaking out of the castle. Harry has been in Lake District for boot
camp for nearly two weeks, so unless I can Apparate out of the castle
I haven't been going anywhere."</p><p class="calibre9">There was a silence between
them as McGonagall processed the information. After a fashion, she
nodded at Ginny, pointing to the empty chair near her desk. "Please
tell me what has been going on that would make people think this of
you. Have you and he…?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Professor! That is
absolutely none of your business." Ginny felt her face redden.
"And just so you know, we haven't done anything, and anyone
who says we have is a lying, evil snake!"</p><p class="calibre9">The older woman looked at her,
astonished at Ginny's words.</p><p class="calibre9">"I have an idea who is it,
anyway, Professor. Jonathan Martin is a royal pain in the arse. Do
you know what he and his friends have got going?" she asked and
watched the woman shake her head. "They have a fifty Galleon bet
on Jonathan getting me in the sack for Valentine's, and seeing how
close it is I'd say they're getting a bit desperate."</p><p class="calibre9">"And why didn't you tell
me about this when it all started?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Because I thought Harry
took care of it in November. Obviously Jonathan recently got his
balls back," Ginny retorted.</p><p class="calibre9">"Language, Miss Weasley,"
McGonagall warned. "I will handle Mr. Martin and his friends,
thank you very much. You may go now, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny ran a hand through her
hair and sighed heavily. "I just want this to go away. I'm
tired of everyone assuming the worst of me. I'm tired of everyone
looking at me."</p><p class="calibre9">"Then perhaps it is a good
thing you're not going to the gala this evening." Ginny was
shocked at how gentle her teacher sounded at that moment, and felt
almost as if she had her mother there. "I was young once, too,
Ginny, and I am not unaware of how fragile emotions can be when faced
with gossip." She tenderly stroked Ginny's shoulder and began
leading her out of the room. "May I suggest a visit with Mrs.
Lupin?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny nodded and whispered,
"Thank you, Professor," as she wiped a tear from her eye
and headed toward the Great Hall.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"…and then, I asked for
a bowl of spinach ice cream. He nearly lost his lunch that day,"
Tonks chuckled. She and Ginny were sitting on the sofa in her and
Remus' quarters eating ice cream and ignoring the man sitting
across the room from them.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Love, I am not that
weak-stomached, and you know that," Remus chimed in. He barely
looked up from his paper as he spoke, rustling the paper as he turned
the page.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, Remus, lighten up,
you old fuddy duddy," Tonks laughed. "Here, Ginny, have
some more ice cream. It always helps to eat chocolate when you've
been exposed to the Dark Arts." Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are you referring to me,
my little Kneazle?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Wouldn't dream of it,
poopsey!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh stop it, both of you!
Ron and Hermione were never that bad," Ginny said sourly. "And
don't you dare say anything about Harry and me."</p><p class="calibre9">"So, Ginny, did Minerva
actually try to talk about sex with you?" Tonks asked with her
eyebrow raised as she turned to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay, I'm leaving."
Remus got up off his chair and took his empty bowl into the
kitchenette. "I prefer not to imagine one of my oldest friends
and mentors talking about that subject. I fear I shall never enjoy
copulating again." This statement brought forth another round of
laughter from the ladies.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay, fine, Remus, but
the next time you feel the urge to go all doggy on me, I'll remind
you of that statement, okay?" That remark earned her a tea towel
on the head, which Tonks immediately transformed into something a bit
more silky and lacy before tossing it back to her husband. Remus
shook his head as he left the room.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny calmed herself down and
looked seriously at Tonks. "You know, I have a strange feeling
Harry forgot about Valentine's Day. He didn't mention it in his
last letter."</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, ask him, Ginny,"
Tonks suggested.</p><p class="calibre9">"I can't do that. He'll
think I'm a clingy little…oh, you know."</p><p class="calibre9">"No he won't. He'll
give himself a quick kick in the arse, that's what he'll do!"
Tonks took another bite of her chocolate ice cream with marinara
sauce. "Men need to be reminded of those sorts of things,
especially the older they get!"</p><p class="calibre9">"I heard that,
Nymphadora!"</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The next few days seemed to
rush by in a flurry for Ginny. She tried several times to begin her
letter to Harry but was either interrupted or was called away for one
reason or the other. Before she knew it, it was February fourteenth
and the day was a intensely bright as she woke up. The first thing
Ginny did was to eagerly look toward the window for any sign of
Hedwig. There was none.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Well, the mail will come
soon enough," she told herself as she threw back the covers and
stepped onto the chilly stone floor underneath her.</p><p class="calibre9">Dressing quickly, she headed
down the stairs and entered the Great Hall, which was bedecked for
the holiday with sparkly hearts, roses, and twinkling fairy lights.
Her mind went back to her first year and she was reminded of the
garish decorations that Gilderoy Lockhart thought were so
appropriate.</p><p class="calibre9">"Dear Merlin, did Madame
Puddifoot vomit in here?" she asked as she sat down next to
Colin at the Gryffindor table. She shook her head as glitter
sprinkled into her hair. "Whose bloody idea was this?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Sorry you don't
appreciate it, Ginny." She turned around and saw Tonks standing
there with a smug look on her face. "Call it the whim of a
pregnant woman and the fact that we could all use a little cheering
up today. Oh, by the way, what time is Harry coming?" Tonks sat
down next to Ginny and took a piece of bacon from the plate in front
of her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Don't know. He hasn't
sent a letter since after the gala. I'm getting nervous now. I've
got all the plans made, and I'm not sure if I'll get to see him
at all now."</p><p class="calibre9">"So, Potter gave up on
you?" asked a deep voice that made Ginny cringe. She turned
around and saw her least favourite Ravenclaw standing in front of her
with a bouquet of roses and a satisfied smirk on his face.</p><p class="calibre9">"No, Jonathan." Ginny
stood up and looked at Tonks. "Sorry, I seem to have lost my
appetite." Making her way toward the door, she strode past him,
ignoring the looks of the rest of the students that had gathered for
breakfast that morning.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh come on, now! The
least you can do is thank me for the flowers! It took me a lot of
work to get these," he pleaded as he chased after her. The
sound of his feet was thudding against the hard floor. He was
pathetic and so very transparent. Jonathan caught up to her and
stepped in front of her, holding the flowers to her and cocking his
head to the side.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank you," she said
flatly. "But I'm sure you can find someone else who'll want
them."</p><p class="calibre9">Jonathan moved in and
whispered, "But you're the one I want to give them to. I've
been dreaming of our kiss, Ginny. Remember?" Reaching for her
hand, he pulled her to him, in front of the whole school no less, and
leaned in as if to kiss her. "I can take your mind off your
troubles today, love."</p><p class="calibre9">With her free hand, Ginny
slapped him across the cheek, the sound echoing through the Great
Hall. She'd pay for that, she was sure, but it felt damned good
just to see the look of shock on his face. "Sorry. I think
you'll owe your little friends a right sum of money, yeah? Yes, I
know." She swung around and marched into the Entrance Hall and
out the front door, fighting to hold back the anger that was bubbling
up inside her.</p><p class="calibre9">The cold air cleared her head
far faster than she had thought it would, but she couldn't bring
herself to head back into the castle. This was supposed to be a
special day for her and Harry and it was just starting out altogether
wrong. She kicked the snow in front of her. How could he forget
Valentine's Day? He'd asked her to plan something special and he
had the NERVE to forget? Harry Potter would wish that he had been
blown to bits by Voldemort when Ginny Weasley was through with him.</p><p class="calibre9">It was the worst Valentine's
Day she ever had. It was even worse than the one during her first
year when she'd embarrassed herself and Harry with that damn
singing Valentine.</p><p class="calibre9">She sat at The Three
Broomsticks watching her friends huddle around the ones they loved
and exchange looks and kisses that were painful to watch, hoping
against hope that Harry would burst in through the doors, throw
himself at her feet, and beg for her forgiveness. But that moment
never came and instead of feeling loved and valued, she felt cheated
and more alone than she ever felt in her life.</p><p class="calibre9">As Ginny, Luna, Dennis and Colin made
their way back to the castle, a small Hufflepuff came running up to
them.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are…are you Gin…Ginny
Weas…ley?" he huffed, leaning down with his hands on his
knees.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes," she answered
wearily. "What's the matter?" The boy handed Ginny a
rolled-up piece of parchment tied with a piece of red ribbon. She
took it from him and the boy ran back the way he came.</p><p class="calibre9">"Open it, Ginny!"
Luna urged her eagerly. She watched as Ginny hastily tore the ribbon
from the parchment and unrolled it in her hand.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Ginny---</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Sorry I'm late. Meet me at the
cave behind the Hog's Head.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Luna!" Ginny hugged
Luna in a tight embrace. "He's here! He's here!" Ginny
gave Luna her bag and took off toward the cave in a flat out run.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny slowed down as she
approached the entrance of the cave, taking deep breaths to calm
herself down but her heart was thumping wildly inside her chest.
"Harry? Harry, you in here?" She stepped inside the
darkness of the cave, and lit her wand softly, giving the inside of
the cave a warm inviting glow.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin?" She watched as
he approached her from the shadows, bringing a smile to her face. In
her excitement, she ran at him, wrapped her arms around his neck, and
pulled him in for a kiss, his glasses falling to the side of his
face. Ginny's hands went to his hair and her fingers buried
themselves in his thick locks. She moaned as he deepened the kiss,
eagerly seeking entrance into her mouth and she willingly gave it.</p><p class="calibre9">In the darkness of the cave, they
kissed and lost themselves in the moment. Ginny was amazed at his
ardour and forwardness, if not slightly taken aback. But it had been
so long since she'd seen him that she soon let those worries
disappear.</p><p class="calibre9">He moaned and began tugging her
down onto the floor of the cave, which she discovered was covered
with cushions that they sank into as he gently laid her on her back.
His kisses followed a trail down her neck while his fingers began
trailing down her arm, sending tingles up and down her spine. With
boldness he'd never shown before, he rolled on top of her, pinning
her beneath him and pulling open her shirt roughly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Har…Harry!" Ginny
tried to lift his head from her now exposed upper body. His mouth
fastened onto the swell of her breast and he began sucking on her
tender flesh. "Ouch! Harry, that HURTS!" Ginny fisted her
hands in his hair and yanked his head up to look him in the eyes. A
beam of light fell on his face, causing her eyes to widen in both
fear and anger. "Jonathan!" Ginny began to scoot herself
backwards away from him, her feet skidding in the gravel beyond the
cushion.</p><p class="calibre9">"What's the matter,
Ginny? Don't you like the way I kiss?" he asked with an evil
smirk on his face, tossing the glasses onto the floor of the cave.
"<em class="calibre8">You</em> kiss like a dream." Ginny scrambled to her feet
and began turning from him, hoping to get away.</p><p class="calibre9">"Jonathan, I told you
before. I love Harry! Why can't you understand that?" Ginny
inched her way slowly across the cold wall toward the opening in the
half-darkness of the cave. Without taking her eyes off him for a
second, she took hold of her wand and closed her eyes, saying
"<em class="calibre8">Expecto Patronum</em>" over and over in her mind. A
silver, misty doe appeared and leapt toward Jonathan, catching him
off guard before prancing out into the daylight.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny, emboldened by the
appearance of her Patronus, pointed her wand at him menacingly and
cast a non-verbal spell that sent Jonathan's wand into her other
hand. He was still in shock after her actions and made no movement.
Taking the opportunity, she cast another spell on him, magical ropes
binding him and a cloth wrapped around his mouth, effectively
silencing him.</p><p class="calibre9">From outside the cave, Ginny
heard footsteps and people shouting her name. She forgot that any
Order member would follow her Patronus to offer their assistance.
Both she and Jonathan turned toward the light at the opening of the
cave to see Luna, Tonks, and Professor Lupin charging into the cave.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny! What happened?"
shouted Professor Lupin. He and the others stared at the scene in
front of them. "Jonathan! What is going on?"</p><p class="calibre9">"That's not Harry,"
Luna stated plainly. "She got a note saying that Harry wanted to
meet her here. And that, Professor Lupin, is obviously not Harry."</p><p class="calibre9">"Tonks, take Ginny and
Luna back to the castle while Mr. Martin and I have a word,"
Lupin said gruffly, almost growling at the boy who still bound and
gagged on the ground.</p><p class="calibre9">Tonks stepped forward to place
an arm around a now shaking Ginny and began pulling her out of the
cave. "Ginny," Tonks whispered, "you should button
up." Ginny looked down to see her shirt unbuttoned and a rather
large, rather dark love bite on her left breast. Feeling her face
flush, Ginny's hands went to her shirt, pulling it shut before
allowing Tonks to lead her back outside.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny was silent the entire
walk back to the castle, and she let Tonks take her to the Hospital
Wing without any protest. She gave no resistance when Madam Pomfrey
administered a Calming Draught and even allowed the woman to tuck her
into a bed, all the while not saying a single word.</p><p class="calibre9">"Miss Weasley, this came
for you shortly after they brought you here," Madam Pomfrey told
her, handing Ginny another letter. "Do you want me to read it to
you?" Ginny nodded and the matron began reading:</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Ginny—</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Just wanted to let you know that
you became an aunt today. His name is Kristoffer Arthur Jenz-Weasley.
He's adorable, Gin. Can you believe it? I'm a father!</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Charlie, Amanda and Kristoffer</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny wiped away the tears that
formed in her eyes and she smiled over at Madam Pomfrey, who wore a
slight smile on her face.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"I'm an aunt," she
simply stated.</p><p class="calibre9">After a nice nap and a meeting with
Lupin and McGonagall in the infirmary, Ginny was released to Colin,
who escorted her back to Gryffindor Tower.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, are you going to
be alright?" he asked at the bottom of the stairs that led to
the dormitories. She nodded and gave Colin a warm hug.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks, Colin. I'll be
fine." Deep inside, Ginny knew she wouldn't. It was perhaps
the worst day of her life. She was pleased with the punishment handed
down to Jonathan; he'd been expelled and sent packing that very
afternoon. But what really bothered her was that she let her love for
Harry get in the way of her better judgement. She should have known
there was something wrong when she entered the cave; Harry would have
never met her in a cave. It would be as if he were trying to hide
their relationship from others.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry. She was angry with both
herself and him. She was angry with herself for being so naïve
and stupid; she was upset with Harry for leaving her alone on
Valentine's Day, seemingly having forgotten about the entire thing.</p><p class="calibre9">As she huddled inside her curtained
four-poster bed, she tried thinking of ways to make Harry as
miserable as she felt. Things like cursing him with a Fat-Lip Jinx,
or a Mole-Vision Spite Spell sounded good to her about five minutes
ago, but as she sat there listening to the slow breathing of her
roommates she knew nothing she or Harry did would make things any
better. She was just about to extinguish her light when a familiar
tapping at the window drew her out of her curtained bed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Better late than never,
Hedwig," she scolded the white owl before showing it to the top
of her bed-post. Harry's hurried handwriting across the parchment
angered her and yet it made her heart soften. <em class="calibre8">At least he
remembered</em>.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Ginny,</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I know nothing I say will
make up for the stupid mistake I made today. There's no excuse. I
have been pulled every way the last few weeks and things just got
away from me. I blew it. I'm sorry…</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The rest of the letter was full
of him trying to explain things away and offerings of tokens of his
sincerity. It was the last thing she needed right now. She needed
Harry; she needed him to hold her and say he loved her; she needed to
kiss him and feel herself drift away on clouds of bliss. She wanted
to do all the things she had planned for the two of them, <em class="calibre8">on his
insistence</em>, and make him forget that he was famous. She just
wanted to be his girlfriend.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Taking the letter, she did
something very unusual. She crumpled it in her hand and threw it into
the heater, watching it turn to ashes.</p><p class="calibre9">Over the next few days, Hedwig
was an almost daily visitor. She would arrive in the Great Hall with
the regular post; she would arrived early in the morning or late in
the afternoon. Each time, the owl would look at her quizzically as if
to say, 'Read the letter. The boy misses you.' And each time,
Ginny would take the letter, shoo Hedwig away and toss the letter
aside. Her roommates knew better than to ask her about the letters,
and Sarah Mitchell even stopped bothering her.</p><p class="calibre9">After two weeks of letting
Ginny shoo her away, Hedwig became insistent. She stood firm and bit
Ginny a time or two, even drawing blood one particular morning.</p><p class="calibre9">"Damn you, Hedwig!"
She shouted at the calm bird before she sucked on her finger. "Fine.
I'll read the damn note." Ginny untied the parchment and
unrolled it carefully.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Ginny, it's Hermione.</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry feels terrible about
what happened and is taking it very poorly. His hair stopped growing
and is actually starting to fall out. He goes to bed right after he
gets home and has taken to drinking on the weekends. Ginny, you have
to talk to him. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I understand that you are angry
with him and goodness knows I would be with Ron if he did something
like this, but you really need to let Harry tell you what went on.
He's miserable and I think you are the only one that can fix him
right now.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry will Floo call you
Saturday at ten. Don't let him down.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Please Ginny.</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Hedwig gave Ginny an accusatory
glance and looked at her sternly as she reached into her bag to
retrieve a quill, quickly scratching her reply. Satisfied that Hedwig
wouldn't bite her again, Ginny fastened the note and away Hedwig
flew.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny found it difficult to
concentrate on her studies knowing that Harry was going to call her
in a few days. She was caught daydreaming in Charms, she completely
destroyed her Rejuvenating Potion and had to stay after class to redo
it, and to top it all off she'd received a detention from
McGonagall when she hexed a third-year Ravenclaw who asked for
Harry's autograph.</p><p class="calibre9">She just couldn't catch a break.</p>
