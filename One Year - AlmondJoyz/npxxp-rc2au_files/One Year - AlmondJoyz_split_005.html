<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_6">*Chapter 5*: December</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One
Year</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter
Five:</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre8">December</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>November's
sun gave way to the grey dinginess of December as snow began to fall
in earnest over the cold stonewalls of Hogwarts castle. A fluffy
layer covered nearly everything on the grounds, causing the corridors
and classrooms to seem even less friendly than they had been.
Students were known to cast Warming Spells as they walked in groups
in between classes to avoid any single student being caught breaking
Mr. Filch's 'No Magic in the Corridor' rule. Filch, even in
all his pompous glory, really couldn't blame them, either. Even he
had been seen carrying Muggle hand warmers, the kind hunters use.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">However,
the thing that bothered Ginny Weasley the most was the fact that
Harry had returned from Wales last week and hadn't got in touch
with her. Hedwig had recuperated during his absence and delivered
him a scathing note from Hagrid, accusing him of trying to murder the
poor owl. Ginny had sent a number of owls to Harry since his return,
and the only response she'd received were short, curt messages
telling her that he was fine and that he didn't want to talk about
it. She knew he was a rather private person, but his avoidance of
her is what bothered her the most.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
look out, there's an owl for you," warned Colin Creevey. She
looked up at the post owl and recognized it as the one she'd sent
to Harry with her last letter. The owl stopped and watched as she
unenthusiastically removed the letter from its leg. Setting the
letter on the table next to her, she returned to her breakfast.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are
you alright?" Ginny's head snapped up again and she glared at
Colin, who looked appeared quite concerned.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
yes, never better."</p><p class="calibre9">"You're
lying," Colin observed.</p><p class="calibre9">"Brilliant
deduction, Colin. I think even Trelawney could have seen that one!"
Dennis piped in. "Aren't you going to read the letter?"</p><p class="calibre9">"What
do you care?" Ginny rarely snapped at her friends. "Here,
read it if you're so hell-bent on knowing what's in it."
She tossed the letter to him, and he took it in his hands. Giving
Colin a questioning look, he opened it, and out sprung what looked
like a thousand rose petals in all colours: pink, red, white, yellow,
lavender and fuchsia, showering down like the remnants of fireworks.
Ginny's eyes wandered over the petals as they floated down onto the
table and landed, ever so softly, on Dennis' shoulders, hair and
breakfast.</p><p class="calibre9">"Here,
Ginny. I think this should improve your mood," Dennis said,
handing her the letter. Colin helped his brother gather up the
flower petals into a small bag he conjured and handed it to her once
it was filled.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank
you," Ginny barely whispered. She quietly got up from the table
and left the Great Hall, clutching the letter and bag of
sweet-smelling petals to her chest. A smile grew on her face as she
raced up the stairs and headed toward the Gryffindor Tower. Once in
the girls' dormitory, Ginny drew the curtains of her bed around her
and threw the multi-coloured petals into the air, watching them float
and settle around her as she sat on the. Smiling for the first time
in nearly a week, she opened Harry's letter, feeling a soft lump of
fabric falling beside her, but ignoring it completely.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Hello
there, my love,</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I'm
sorry. I never meant to make you angry or make you think I didn't
care about you. I had a horrible trip to Wales, and it took me a
while to get out of my strap. It didn't help that I nearly killed
Hedwig. Hagrid sent me a Howler. I tell you, Gin, a giant Howler is
ten times worse than a normal Howler. Well, maybe not one from your
mum, but you know what I mean.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I
hope you like the flowers. I couldn't get a full bouquet in there,
so I thought the petals would work just as well. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I
missed you terribly. I hope I never, ever have to spend that much
time without talking or writing to you again. I hated it. I felt
like someone tore out my heart and left it lying on a pile of dragon
dung in Greenhouse Three.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Anyway,
I'm sorry about my other letters. As I said, I had a terrible time
in Wales. Hope Abraham was my partner</em>.</p><p class="calibre9">'Oh
no,' thought Ginny. 'What happened?' Her stomach dropped and
she nearly felt like she would vomit.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">As
I told you before, Kingsley went along with us and helped us while we
were doing research and all. We were able to locate the items we
were looking for and tried to destroy them. One item, which held
part of Bellatrix Lestrange's soul, hit Hope with a spell. I have
a hard time talking about what happened after that, and that's why
I was being such a stupid arse. I can't tell you about it in a
letter. I need to see you, hold you, and kiss you becauseâ€¦</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
gods, Harry. Please don't tell me you slept with her!" Ginny
said into the empty room, her words echoing off the walls.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Ginny,
I love you, and I want you to come to Hogsmeade tonight. I know
you'll say you can't but please, please meet me in the Shrieking
Shack at midnight. I shrunk my Invisibility Cloak for you,</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Love,
Harry</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Hundreds
of thoughts raced through her mind as she went over his letter ten,
fifteen times. <em class="calibre8">Did she die? Did he kill her? Did he kiss her? </em>
None of the thoughts helped comfort her or put her mind at ease. The
knot in her stomach tightened and she ran to the loo, emptying her
breakfast into the nearest toilet.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">In
Ginny's mind, it was a good thing that today was a Saturday. If it
were a weekday, she'd be in such a foul mood that no one would be
safe from her temper. As it was, she moped around the common room,
not wanting to talk to anyone, not wanting to go outside and play in
the fresh snow, and certainly not wanting to think about what Harry
was going to tell her later that night. Her friends, thankfully,
gave her the space she so desperately desired and left her alone.
She had told no one of her plans, told no one about the letter, yet
everyone knew to stay away from Ginevra Weasley, less they wished to
die a very slow and painful death.</p><p class="calibre9">As
the day wore on, she sunk deeper into herself, debating whether she
should actually go into the village to see him. The Invisibility
Cloak lay in her rucksack at the foot of her bed, untouched since she
put it away. She found herself in the window seat, gazing out across
the lawn that was now covered in what looked like six inches of
freshly fallen snow as her eyes drifting toward the sparkling lights
of the village ahead. Knowing he would be there soon gave her a tiny
reason to smile. She'd missed him terribly; she never thought her
heart could hurt so much as it had while he was away. And now, after
waiting for two long weeks, it was only a mere hour away from her
appointed meeting time with Harry. Despite the hour, the common room
was still full of her fellow Gryffindors talking, playing Exploding
Snap, Wizards Chess or snogging in the comfortable armchairs and
sofas of the large, scarlet room. She had to look away from an
overly zealous snogging couple out of sheer jealousy before advising
them, "Go get a room."</p><p class="calibre9">She
jumped as the clock chimed half eleven, and she quickly got off the
cushioned seat, surprising herself with her eagerness. She took the
stairs to the dormitory two at a time and flung open the door, not
caring whether she woke up Sarah, who was already in bed. Pulling on
a heavier jumper and drawing her hair into a ponytail, she couldn't
decide whether to get excited or nervous at the prospect of seeing
Harry again. She pulled on her coat and shoes, grabbed the rucksack
from under the bed, checking to make sure the cloak was still in
there, and took off down the stairs, forgetting that it was past
curfew.</p><p class="calibre9">Once
outside the portrait hole and away from the ranting Fat Lady, she
pulled the cloak over her and headed toward the doors of the entrance
hall. Stopping twice to avoid the patrolling prefects, she made her
way to the large, oak doors. As she pulled them open, she swore at
herself for forgetting to put on boots.</p><p class="calibre9">The
snow buried her feet as she traipsed off toward the Whomping Willow.
Finding the correct knot, she pressed it and walked down the path
that led toward the Shrieking Shack.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Damn,
how could Remus stand this? It's bloody cold in here!</em> She
wrapped the cloak around her for extra warmth, laughing at herself as
she imagined what she must look like; a head with no torso and legs
that ended in feet covered with snow. She desperately wished she
could create Bluebell Flames as well as Hermione.</p><p class="calibre9">At
the end of the path, she heard music. Muggle music. Big Band music.
No one knew she liked that music but Harry. Her heart skipped a
beat as she climbed the stairs to the room where she was sure Harry
was waiting for her.</p><p class="calibre9">He
sat with his back toward her in front of a roaring fire. His hair
was considerably longer, drawn back into a ponytail.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry?"</p><p class="calibre9">He
turned around, clearing the distance between them in three steps, and
gathered her into his arms, kissing her hard. She felt tears slide
down his cheeks as he continued kissing her with all his might. He
pulled away from her and ran his fingers over her face, as if he was
trying to make sure she was real.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny.
I love you." He kissed her again, astounding her with his
ardour.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
know that, Harry. Please, tell me what's wrong." She was
scared at what she was going to hear, but he needed to tell her for
his own sake.</p><p class="calibre9">He
sat her down in a chair next to the fire he'd started and walked
over to a pile of things he had brought with him. She watched him as
he carefully removed a large, stone basin that she immediately
recognized as a Pensieve<em class="calibre8">. What does he have to show me?</em> Based on Harry's urgency, she knew it couldn't be good.</p><p class="calibre9">He
carefully set the basin on the rickety little table to her left and
knelt in front of it on the floor. Placing his wand against his
temple, he withdrew the memory in a long, silvery thread and placed
it in the basin. He looked at her with eyes that had seen too much
in eighteen years, eyes that were now brimming with tears.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry?"
she asked. She reached out, stroked his cheek, making him lean into
it, and watched him close his eyes, feeling her warmth spread through
him.</p><p class="calibre9">He
took her hand from his cheek, motioning for her to kneel beside him.
When she did, he nodded and they both leaned forward, falling into
Harry's memory, for better or for worse.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"Kingsley,
I just don't know how to get this open. I've tried everything I
can think of." Harry looked at the older man and handed him the
gold-encrusted ceramic music box. "Why do we even need to open
it? We know what's inside."</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Do
you really want to keep it intact so she can try and get it?"
Kingsley Shacklebolt scratched his baldhead, trying to come up with a
new plan. "Hope, do you have any ideas?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">She
looked up from her notes to the two men in front of her. Her blonde
hair had loosened from its clip, falling to cover her dark green
eyes.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Here,
let me have a look." She took the box from Kingsley and
fingered the top of the cover, pausing at a carved 'B' that
looked strangely out of place. "See this? I bet that's the
latch. The gold's scraped away."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"How
come I didn't see that?" asked Harry. He scooted closer to
her to see.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Because
you're a man, and you don't have an eye for detail when it comes
to things that belong to girls." She smiled coyly at Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"So
open it," Harry told her. He furrowed his brow, getting
impatient with her.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Whatever
you do, Hope, be careful. Bellatrix is one loony bird,"
Shacklebolt warned.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hope
continued to examine the music box, turning it over in her hands and
pausing to examine the rest of the carvings. She pulled out a
magnifying glass from the drawer and concentrated on some small
letters carved onto the bottom. "I guess you missed this, too,
Harry." She pointed out the letters and handed him the glass,
her hand lingering on his as he took it from her. She let out a
piercing giggle. Her voice was strange, and Harry stared at her for
a moment.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Hope?"
he asked. "Are you alright?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Kingsley
stared at the girl with concern in his eyes. "Take it from
her."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry
reached for the music box but she snatched it away.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Do
you want to know what it says or not, Harry?" Hope asked
impatiently. Harry nodded, his eyes transfixed on the girl in front
of him.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Fine,"
she began, "then pay attention." She took the magnifying
glass from Harry and read the inscription aloud, "</em>Para
la mujer joven que quiere alcanzar el poder<em class="calibre8">."
She stroked the carved 'B' and the top of the box popped open,
sending a green light into the room.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"</em>Protego!"<em class="calibre8"> Harry shouted. He looked at Kingsley and realized he was out cold.
Hope was staring at him, a crazed look in her eyes. He'd seen that
look before, years before, in the Department of Mysteries.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Baby
Potter, how nice to see you again!" Hope was speaking, but the
voice was no longer hers; it was an evil voice that sounded tinny and
full of contempt. She brushed her hair back from her face and
laughed. "My, but you've grown up, Baby Potter. Rather
nicely, I might add." Her eyes moved up and down Harry's
body, coming to rest on his chest. "</em>Accio shirt<em class="calibre8">!"
Harry's shirt flew off his chest, buttons falling to the floor.
"Very nicely."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry
just stood there, shirtless, watching Hope, possessed by Bellatrix
Lestrange. She moved closer to him, almost touching him. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Let
her go!" Harry demanded.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"This
girl wants you, Harry. Why deny yourself any longer? You want her,
too; I can feel it." Hope began to unbutton her blouse.</em></p><p class="calibre9">"Petrificus
Totalus!"<em class="calibre8"> he shouted. Hope blocked Harry's spell with a
wave of her hand. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"You'll
only hurt the girl, Potter. You do have a soft spot for someone,
though, don't you? Tell me her name, Hope." </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ginny,"
The voice was Hope's again, soft and controlled. "Ginny
Weasley. They're in love."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"In
love, Harry? What a useless emotion. Does she look like this?"
Hope removed her shirt. Harry backed up.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Stop
it!" Harry yelled, pointing his wand at her. "Don't
touch me!" He looked over at Kingsley, hoping he'd wake up.
He lay there, sprawled across the floor. He was barely breathing.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Harry,
come on, be nice. Oh, I see. Shall I change my looks? A quick
glamour perhaps?" In a flash, Hope's hair became the exact
shade as Ginny's, and Harry's eyes grew wider. "Better?"</em></p><p class="calibre9">"CatatÃ³nica!"<em class="calibre8"> The spell hit Harry in the middle of his chest, sending him to the
floor, his eyes open, watching Hope, unable to move or speak. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hope
walked over to Harry and bent down beside him. "Not exactly the
way Hope would like to have her way with you, Baby Potter, but it'll
do." She unbuckled his belt and began working on the button of
his trousers. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hope
reached into Harry's trousers, lowering the zipper and her hands
went inside his boxer shorts. He was hard. She smiled wickedly,
chuckling in Hope's voice. Kneeling beside him, she bent down to
kiss him, never taking her eyes off him. She removed her mouth and
her gaze went down his body.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Well,
well, well. You are gifted." She smiled again and began to
lower her head toward his pelvis. "Ginny is a lucky woman."
</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry
squeezed his eyes shut. A moment later, Hope flew against the wall,
leaving Harry lying on the floor. He squeezed his eyes shut and her
ankles lifted her into the air. Her screams filled the room around
Harry. He squeezed his eyes shut again, and Kingsley awakened and
looked around the room.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"What
the bloody hell?" He sprung to his feet, and stood over Harry
while Hope continued to scream while she dangled from the ceiling.
"Fuck, Harry, what'd she do?" He knelt down next to him.
"Full-Body Bind?" Harry could only blink. "Once for
yes, twice for no." He blinked twice. Hope's screams
distracted Kingsley from the conversation. "Shut the hell up,
bitch! </em>Silencio!<em class="calibre8">" He turned back to Harry. </em>"CatatÃ³nica<em class="calibre8">?" Harry blinked once. "This
is going to hurt. Ready?" He blinked once. "</em>ReanimatÃ©
Comatalus<em class="calibre8">!" Harry shrieked in pain. When he recovered, he
quickly sat up, fastening his trousers.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"She's
possessed by Bellatrix, Kingsley!" he shouted, pointing up at
the ceiling. "</em>Liberacorpus!<em class="calibre8">" Hope came crashing
down to the floor, screaming silently.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"When
did they teach you that at school?" Kingsley gaped at Harry
with an angry look. </em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Never
mind. Now what do we do about Hope?"</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The
air around Ginny began to swirl and the memory stopped. As she
pulled out of the Pensieve, she saw Harry slumped against the chair.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Harryâ€¦Harry,
talk to me," she pleaded. She sat next to him on the floor,
watching him. He looked like he could throw something, scream or
cry. She didn't know what to do. She reached out and gently
stroked his hair, trying to calm him down. He looked so lost.
"Harry, you didn't do anything. It's okay." Without
warning, he sprung up from the floor and began pacing the worn floor
under his feet.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
hate this! Why can't they just leave me the hell alone?" Harry
picked up a chair and flung it across the room, smashing it against
the wall, making Ginny flinch. "Why does everyone expect <em class="calibre8">ME</em>
to finish everything? I'm only eighteen!" He turned and looked
at Ginny with a wild look in his eyes, reminding her of his outburst
at Grimmauld Place when he was fifteen. "I'm so fucking angry
with myself for how I reacted once sheâ€¦" he broke off, the
tears starting to fall. Harry flung himself onto the bed, perching
himself on the edge."I'm sorry, Ginny. You know I'd never
actually want to do that with her." He spoke into his arms,
muffling his voice.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
I know that. What happened to Hope?"</p><p class="calibre9">"She's
in St. Mungo's. Kingsley smashed the music box and the spell
stopped, but Hope is still unconscious." He wiped his eyes with
his sleeve and looked up at her. "She may never come out of it.
She's on the fourth floor."</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Spell
damage</em>, Ginny thought. <em class="calibre8">She's just like the Longbottoms</em>.
"Can't they do anything for her?"</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
shook his head. "It would appear only Bellatrix can help her
out. Perhaps if we ask nicely, she'll help us out." His voice
was full of sarcasm, which Ginny chose to ignore.</p><p class="calibre9">"Why
Hope? Why didn't the spell get you? Or Kingsley?"</p><p class="calibre9">He
stared at her blankly. "A woman had to open the box. Of
course, it was supposed to be Bellatrix, but Hope knew Spanish and
was able to release the spell." He paused to catch his breath.
"The piece of her soul went into her and took over. She had
kind of a split personality."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
she made the Horcrux after the battle in the Ministry, right?"
He nodded. "That's why she remembered who you were."</p><p class="calibre9">"Er,
Ginnyâ€¦" he began.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hmm?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I
think she really would haveâ€¦" he stopped again, furrowing his
eyebrows.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
Harry." She took his hands in hers and pulled him to stand next
to her, gathering him in her arms, trying her best to help him,
knowing there was absolutely nothing in the world that would take
away his hurt. She put her hands on his face and gently kissed him,
almost as if it was their first kiss. He opened his mouth and kissed
her harder while she wrapped her arms around him, pulling him close.
All too soon, he pulled away.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
can't, Ginny. It has nothing to do with you. I need time before
we do anything again." She saw the hurt in his eyes. "I
guess I know how you feel about, you know, not having sex. I guess
what I'm trying to say isâ€¦"</p><p class="calibre9">She
interrupted him with another kiss. "I know, Harry. It's
okay." She was starting to cry now. "We can go slowly."
She looked at the watch on Harry's wrist; it was almost two.
"I've got to go, Harry." She stood up to leave, but he
grabbed her wrist.</p><p class="calibre9">"Can
you stay? I just want to hold you, make sure I'm not dreaming.
Please?" Harry turned around and transfigured the bare bed into
a duplicate of his at home. "I don't want to be alone."</p><p class="calibre9">How
can I say no to that? "As long as you need me here." They
walked over to the bed, slipped under the covers, fully clothed, with
their arms wrapped around each other, and fell asleep.</p><p class="calibre9">Early
morning sunlight streamed in from the dirty window across from the
bed, waking Ginny. She looked around the room, remembering where she
was, finding Harry still sleeping beside her. His watch told her it
was after seven. She gently rubbed his shoulder, trying to wake
him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry.
Harry, wake up."</p><p class="calibre9">His
eyes fluttered open and focused on her, bringing a smile to his face.
"What time is it?" His voice was gravely and sleepy. He
frowned as he looked at his watch. "Shite." He sat up and
pulled on his glasses, swinging his legs to the edge of the bed. "I
didn't think I'd sleep that long. I usually haven't been able
to sleep more than an hour at a time since I got back."</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
great and all, but I'm in for a load of trouble," Ginny told
him. "There's no way I can get out of this, Harry."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
should say not, Ginny." The two of them swung around to find
Remus Lupin standing in the doorway, jaw set, eyes narrowed. "Every
Gryffindor has been up and looking for you. It's just your luck
your parents haven't been notified yet."</p><p class="calibre9">"Remusâ€¦"
began Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
don't want to hear it, Harry," he interrupted. The older man
glared at the two of them, still dishevelled from sleep. "Both
of you come with me. Now."</p><p class="calibre9">"Howâ€¦how
did you find me?" asked Ginny biting back a combination of anger
and fear.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
left Harry's letter lying on your bed." Ginny groaned. "It's
a good thing Sarah's a snoop, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">"Good
for whom?" asked Harry. He saw 'the look' come across
Lupin's face. "Sorry. Come on. Let's go." Harry
held out his hand and he led her out the door and back down the path
to the castle.</p><p class="calibre9">"Do
you need to tell my parents, Remus?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre9">"It's
Professor Lupin, Miss Weasley." They followed in silence the
remainder of the way.</p><p class="calibre9">Once
in the castle, Ginny and Harry received astonished looks from those
watching them and snickers from those with overactive imaginations.
Whispers grew into loud conversations, causing Ginny more
embarrassment than she'd felt in years. They stopped outside of
Lupin's office and walked inside. The loud slam of the heavy oak
door broke the silence, sealing Ginny's fate.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>On
the evening of December 21st, Ginny watched her roommates
dress and primp for the Solstice Celebration. As punishment for her
sneaking out to the Shrieking Shack, Lupin banned Ginny from the
Celebration and required her to remain at the castle until it was
time to leave the next morning. She was suspended from Quidditch
until the beginning of March, causing more than a few ruffled
feathers with her team-mates. To her chagrin, her parents had been
informed and she received her first-ever Howler from her mother, and
had been threatened with being kept from Harry over the holidays as
well. She knew, without a doubt, that Harry had received his own
Howler or two and was probably considering a quiet Christmas at
Grimmauld Place this year rather than facing the wrath of the
Weasleys.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">After
painfully watching Sarah, Enid and Demelza get ready, she made her
way to the common room and hid on a window seat, pulling the curtains
to hide her from view. Her eyes drifted out the window and settled
on the sparkling snow that lay beneath the window. Noises began to
fill the common room as her fellow Gryffindors made their way down
the stairs and out the portrait hole to enjoy their evening.</p><p class="calibre9">Soon
the room was quiet and she opened the curtains around her to reveal
an empty common room. After only five minutes of sitting there
alone, she got up, walked out the portrait hole and into the Entrance
Hall. The cheery Christmas decorations did nothing to lift her foul
mood and only seemed to depress her. Sitting down on a bench near
the front doors, she strained to listen to the music that drifted in
from the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre9">After
a few minutes, she noticed someone sitting beside her. She turned
and found Jonathan, dressed in a maroon jumper and dark trousers. He
smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre9">"How
do you always know where to find me?"</p><p class="calibre9">He
scoffed and answered, "Just lucky, I guess."</p><p class="calibre9">"This
is the first time I'm not looking forward to Christmas. Harry's
liable to have been banished from The Burrow."</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
he'll be there." His deep voice was reassuring. "You'll
have a good holiday."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
don't tell me. You have 'The Inner Eye.'" Ginny shook her
head at the thought.</p><p class="calibre9">"No.
I have a magic eight ball." He withdrew a black ball from his
pocket and gave it a tap with his wand, making it grow to the size of
an orange. Jonathan smiled and held it out to her. "Just ask it
a question and then shake it. Then all will be revealed." She
smirked and raised her eyebrow. "Will Ginny spend Christmas with
Harry?" He shook the black ball and turned it over. "Seeâ€¦'All
signs point to yes.' Hasn't let me down yet."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
where are you spending Christmas?" she asked, trying to be
polite.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
still don't know." Ginny's eyes widened. "Dad's
busy with patients and he's got a new girlfriend, and Mum, well,
she's, um, making me a big brother."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?
Congratulations!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks,"
he dryly replied. "Just another excuse to ignore me. I'm not
her little project anymore."</p><p class="calibre9">"That's
not a very nice thing to say about your mum, Jonathan," Ginny
admonished him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Your
parents love each other, Ginny. Mine tolerate one another. When I
got sick enough to leave school, I thought they'd get back
together. I was stupid," Jonathan said. "She was more
than happy to leave me in a different country with a father I barely
saw and then ship me off to a new school so she could get into the
pants of another rich man."</p><p class="calibre9">She
looked at him, studying his eyes. "I'm sorry. I didn't
know."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
heard you can't go in there," he stated, nodding toward the
Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm
banned, to be precise." She sighed and crossed her arms in
front of her. "He's torturing me, making me stay here and
all."</p><p class="calibre9">"Do
you want to dance?" He stood up and held out his hand to her.
"At least smile once this evening, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">"Whatever,"
she said, standing up and taking his hand. The music from the Great
Hall turned to a slow jazzy piece and they came together and began
moving to the music, twirling around the floor.</p><p class="calibre9">He
was right; she did forget her troubles, if only for a moment, she
closed her eyes, trying to pretend that he was Harry and that she was
wearing the dress she wore for Bill's wedding and Harry was in new
dress robes. She allowed herself to relax and enjoy the music.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,"
he said softly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes?"
He was so close and she suddenly felt warm and content there in
Jonathan's arms with the music wafting around them.</p><p class="calibre9">He
bent forward and kissed her. Without thinking, she kissed him back.
Ginny felt herself relax against him as he pulled her close and
kissed her harder. Jonathan moved his tongue along her lips, causing
her to snap her eyes open and pull away.</p><p class="calibre9">"That
should never have happened." She slowly backed away from him
and then ran up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower.</p><p class="calibre9">The
Fat Lady was gone. "Damn it all to bloody hell!" Her
voice echoed in the emptiness of the castle as she frantically ran
back and forth, looking for the Fat Lady.</p><p class="calibre9">"Who
goes there?" A harsh voice from a painting behind startled her
causing her to turn and face Sir Cadogan. "Milady, why aren't
you frolicking with the other lads and lasses?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Where's
the Fat Lady? I need to get inside!" Her patience was wearing
thin and she had no desire to traipse around the castle looking for
the woman.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ah!
A quest! I shall endeavour to seek out the Guardian of Gryffindor!"
The knight took off, eagerly searching the portraits that hung along
the walls. Ginny paced back and forth before the portrait, cursing
herself and Jonathan indiscriminately. The clock in the Entrance
Hall chimed ten o'clock, and she knew she would have two hours to
herself, at least, before anyone came back.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mistress
fair! I have succeeded in my noble quest. Here, as you requested,
the Fat Lady," announced Sir Cadogan dramatically. The Fat Lady
resumed her position inside the portrait.</p><p class="calibre9">"Bah
humbug!" Ginny shouted at the lady.</p><p class="calibre9">"Washa
matta dearie, have a bad time a' da ball?" Great, she's
drunk! Ginny thought.</p><p class="calibre9">"It's
the password word you pissed old bat! Bah humbug!" Her voice
echoed through the stone hallways.</p><p class="calibre9">"Dear
lady, not so loud! The honour of Gryffindor is contained in those
words!" Sir Cadogan reprimanded Ginny. He pointed his lance at
her, ready to joust.</p><p class="calibre9">"Open
the bleeding door, you bint! Bah humbug!" The passageway
opened and she was finally able to enter the common room. She swore
at the house-elves who were decorating the room, causing several of
them to back away, crying.</p><p class="calibre9">Lovely,
I've made a house-elf cry. Merry Christmas to me.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The
Burrow was decked out in all its second-hand fineness for the
holidays. A large Christmas tree took over most of the sitting room
and was bedecked with twinkling fairy lights and sparkling ornaments
that had been passed down for generations. Garland and red bows
festooned the banisters leading up the numerous flights of stairs and
the front porch railings. The WWN was constantly playing Christmas
carols, both Muggle and Wizard, filling the house with the sounds of
the season. Fourteen Christmas stockings hung over the fireplace,
bringing a small smile to the youngest Weasley's face. There were
stockings for her and her brothers, even Percy, along with her
parents. There was also one for Fleur and Amanda, as well as the
first grandchild, who should be making an appearance in the next few
months. Hermione's stocking was right next to Ron's, and Harry's
stocking assumed its regular spot next to Ginny's.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny
sat comfortably in a cushy chair with her legs tucked under her and a
new jumper warming her body. She sat alone with her thoughts while
the others were outside, playing in the snow. She gave a lame excuse
about needing to do homework when in fact all she could think about
was a conversation she dreaded having with Harry. She needed to tell
him that she'd kissed Jonathan Martin.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
are you okay?" asked Hermione, her cheeks red from the cold.</p><p class="calibre9">"When
did you come in?" Ginny never noticed the door opening or
closing, or the heavy thump of the other girl's boots traipsing
across the floor.</p><p class="calibre9">"Not
long ago." Hermione sat down across from Ginny in the worn
sofa. "Tell me. What happened?"</p><p class="calibre9">"What
makes you think that something happened," Ginny asked, trying to
hide her annoyance that her friend could read her so well.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,"
Hermione began, "you love Christmas and you merely opened your
gifts when it it's your custom to shred the paper to bits."
She paused to breathe. "Then, you very nearly ate the chocolate
pie all by yourself, causing Ron to go into paroxysms of terror."
She eyed Ginny coolly before continuing. "You've been very
nice to Fleur all day. Everyone knows something is wrong. Spill
it." Hermione leaned forward, placing her hands on her knees,
making Ginny feel more uncomfortable every second.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
got up and sat on the couch next to her and whispered, "I kissed
someone."</p><p class="calibre9">Hermione's
eyes grew wide. "Who? Whom?" Ginny stifled a laugh as
Hermione corrected her own grammar. "Does Harry know?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No,"
she whispered again, "and I don't know how to tell him."</p><p class="calibre9">"Who
is he?" All Ginny could do was stare at her and tilt her head
and widen her eyes. Hermione understood. "No!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Shhhh.
How am I supposed to tell Harry that I kissed the git who is betting
on me?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Excuse
me?" The girls whirled around to find Harry standing in the
doorway, a snowball cradled in his hand. His face held a look that
made Ginny feel sick.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harryâ€¦"</p><p class="calibre9">"You
kissed him?" he asked incredulously. "After all thatâ€¦you
kissed him?" He dropped the snowball to the floor where it
broke apart into a puddle as he trudged back outside.</p><p class="calibre9">"Bugger!"
She pulled on her shoes, grabbed a jacket and marched outside,
leaving Hermione on the couch, stunned at what had just happened.</p><p class="calibre9">She
saw a snowball flying toward her out of the corner of her eye, and
with a wave of her wand, it flew back at Fred and hit him squarely in
the face. Laughter rang in her ears as she marched over to the
outhouse, the door open and sounds of smashing coming from inside.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harryâ€¦"
She ducked as a light bulb crashed on the wall over the door.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?
What do you want me to say, Ginny? Thanks for telling me? How
could you do it?" His eyes gleamed brilliant green and were
wide in anger.</p><p class="calibre9">"It
was one kiss, and I stopped it. Shouldn't you be a little more
trusting? Or is there something that you need to tell me too?"
Her anger began to bubble up inside her as she looked at him. "I
don't understand why you're so angry, Harry. Nothing else
happened."</p><p class="calibre9">"So
was it everything you imagined it to be?" His voice was thick
with bitterness. She hated it when he sounded like that. It made
her skin crawl.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
just listen to me!" The door opened behind her, revealing Fred
and George.</p><p class="calibre9">"Trouble
in paradise?" asked George.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
turned around, quickly hexing her brothers and locking the door to
their screams and against further interruptions.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
do you really think that I would WANT to kiss him when I can kiss you
like this?" She moved her face closer to his. "I love
you." Ginny moved the final inch and kissed him softly on the
lips, teasing him, begging him to kiss her back. She kept it up a
little longer and then he took control.</p><p class="calibre9">Reaching
over to her, Harry grabbed her around the waist and pulled her onto
his lap. He deepened the kiss, taking her breath away. Her mouth
opened to his and met his tongue eagerly. They'd never had more
than five minutes alone at The Burrow and this was a long time
coming. She sighed against him, making him hold her tighter and kiss
her harder. Their breathing quickened and their hands roamed freely.
All too soon, Harry pulled away.</p><p class="calibre9">"Will
it happen again?" She shook her head.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry,
I danced with him in the Entrance Hall and he leaned over and kissed
me. That's it. Now kiss me again, okay?"</p><p class="calibre9">"As
much as I love kissing you, I think we had better get back before
Fred and George bring reinforcements," he said with puffy lips.
He brushed the hair out of his face and let her slide off his lap.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
s'pose you're right." Ginny smiled. "Wouldn't fancy
another verbal attack myself. Besides, Mum hasn't served the
Christmas pudding yet, remember?"</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>A/N:
The inscription on the music box is in Spanish. Loosely translated,
it means, "For the young woman who wants to seize power."
I thought that was rather fitting for our friend Bellatrix. Thanks
pili204 for the translation help!!<p class="calibre9"/>
