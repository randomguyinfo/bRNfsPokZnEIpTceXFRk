<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_10">*Chapter 9*: April</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong></p><p class="calibre7">Chapter Nine:</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre8">April</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>April 1stâ€¦The
Twins' Birthday.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny had always dreaded this
day. The twins always made complete arses of
themselves and made everyone around them walk on tenterhooks,
wondering what shite they were going to pull. It also made the family
scrounge around for enough money to get them gifts that wouldn't
garner some sort of idiotic joke rather than a polite 'Thank you.'
For this reason, Ginny was particularly grateful that she was at
school, rather than at home. She'd sent them a full report on the
stunt she'd pulled on Harry and felt that was gift enough. Even
though they'd never complained about her relationship with Harry,
Ginny knew that both Fred and George would be proud of her, and most
likely, they'd develop some sort of product that had the same
effects to market to pre-pubescent boys in the near future.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny shook her head and placed
the last bit of clean clothing into her trunk. Today was the start of
Easter break, and even though it was only a week, Ginny was very
excited, as it would be her first chance to see her nephew. Charlie,
Amanda and Kristoffer were coming for a visit and Ginny was nearly
bouncing off the walls in excitement. She still had a difficult time
thinking of her brother as a father, but she was fairly certain that
the little one would be decked out in little clothes with tiny images
of dragons and would be wearing dragon-hide booties before he could
walk.</p><p class="calibre9">With the last of her things
inside her trunk, Ginny shut the lid and expertly levitated it out
the door, down the stairs and across the Common Room, and waited in
the queue for her turn to exit out the portrait hole. There was a
tapping on her shoulder and she turned around.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, have you got a moment?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh, Sarah, can't it wait
until the train? I really don't want to lose my place in line."
Ginny wondered why Sarah was even being as polite to her as she was,
and in fact, it was rather disturbing. Sarah always had ulterior
motives.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm not going home, Ginny. I
just wanted to talk. Anyway, this is for you. I know how much you
liked it." Sarah stuffed a package into one of the pockets of
Ginny's robes and hastily turned around, heading back up the stairs
to the dormitory.</p><p class="calibre9">"Weasley! Get a move on!" A
disembodied voice shouted at her. Ginny turned around and discovered
she was next in line to leave the Tower. Regaining her composure, she
continued on with her trunk toward Professor Lupin, who was ticking
names off the list.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'll see you on Sunday,
Ginny," Lupin told her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, I thought you and Tonks
would be visiting her parents, what with the baby coming and all."</p><p class="calibre9">At Ginny's remark, the
remaining Gryffindors broke out in cheers and questions about the
arrival of the Lupin baby. Remus and Tonks had tried to prolong the
announcement of the pregnancy, but when Tonks substituted for Remus
back in February, it was a lost cause. The Gryffindors still loved to
tease their Head of House, and he managed to turn a very attractive
crimson, rivalling any live Weasley. Someone even broke out singing,
"And I'm hungry like the wolf." That had to be Adam
Donohue.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks, Ginny,"
Lupin muttered.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, sorry," Ginny
apologized, feeling about an inch high. "I really didn't mean
to embarrass you."</p><p class="calibre9">"Embarrass me? I'm becoming a
father! If anything, Tonks should be embarrassed by having this old
man as the father."</p><p class="calibre9">"Lupin, thanks. I'll never be
able to think about sex in the same way." That was Adam again. A
number of students laughed at the remark and Professor Lupin began
shooing the rest of Gryffindor out the portrait hole and down the
stairs. Once Ginny reached the Entrance Hall, she met up with Luna
and they exited through the old oak doors together, making their way
to the awaiting carriages and Thestrals.</p><p class="calibre9">"You know, I don't think I'll
ever get used to these things, even after riding them," Ginny
muttered to Luna.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well don't you remember this
one, Ginny? You rode this one," Luna ran her hands over the
Thestral's mane in a soothing manner. "She has sparkly green
eyes. Like Harry's."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny stepped in front of the
creature and looked into its eyes, unable to see anything resembling
green eyes. "Come on, Luna, let's get in." The two of
them climbed into the carriage, along with three other Ravenclaws,
and they made their way toward Hogsmeade station.</p><p class="calibre9">"What's in your pocket,
Ginny?" Luna asked. Ginny had forgotten about the paper bag that
Sarah had given her, which was still in her robes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, yeah. I forgot about
it." Ginny removed the package, unwrapped the brown paper
wrapping and pulled out a ceramic picture frame with tiny roses
arranged around the outside. "Oh my. Sarah's had this forever.
She used to keep a picture of her parents in here." Ginny shook
her head. "Why would Sarah of all people give this to me?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, perhaps there is a simple
explanation, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre9">"Like what? She wants to be best
friends? That's not very likely," Ginny pointed out.</p><p class="calibre9">"True. Or perhaps the
Good-Deed Goblins got to her. It's been a warm winter, so they are
more active. Father wrote about them in a letter." Luna could
always make her smile, and this time was no exception. The trip to
the station was quick and uneventful.</p><p class="calibre9">As Ginny and the others
disembarked the carriage, Ginny heard her name down the platform. She
turned around and watched as the crowd of students parted
dramatically to reveal black Auror robes flapping about the body of a
dark-haired young man who was able to set her heart aflutter with a
single look. "Harry!" Ginny's levitation spell broke and
her trunk fell to the platform with a thud as she sprinted to him,
untold numbers of eyes staring at the pair of them. She leapt into
his arms, nearly knocking him to the ground in her enthusiasm. "What
are you doing here?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, it's nice to see you,
too, Ginny," he murmured before she fastened her lips onto his.
They both got lost in their kiss and Ginny felt Harry's hands begin
to wander over her school robes before heading up into her hair.</p><p class="calibre9">"Potter! Weasley!" The pair
broke apart reluctantly to find a very irate looking Hagrid standing
in front of them. "What ya thinkin' actin' like tha' in
public? And you in yer Auror robes, Harry. You have got ter be more
respons-ble." Ginny had never seen Hagrid speak to anyone like
that before.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sorry, Hagrid. But what's
wrong with you?" Ginny asked the half-giant angrily.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm on duty, you two. I'm
s'posed to keep this lot in check. Now get on th' train,"
Hagrid ordered, his hand pointing in the direction of the scarlet
train.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hagrid," Harry began, "I'm
taking Ginny home." Ginny smiled up at him, excitement filling
her up inside.</p><p class="calibre9">"Not wit' out her parents
permission, yer not," Hagrid told him.</p><p class="calibre9">"I've got it." Harry
thrust a note into Hagrid's hand and stood impatiently while he
read the note. "Now what's the matter with you, Hagrid? You're
angry and you never get angry." Ginny watched as Harry and
Hagrid began a staring competition. Hagrid broke first.</p><p class="calibre9">"It's not yer fault, Harry. I
jus' got word from Romania. Norbert's taken ill," Hagrid
announced, his big eyes watering in front of them.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny placed a hand on his
elbow sympathetically. "Oh Hagrid, I'm sorry." Hagrid
blew his nose loudly. "How is he?"</p><p class="calibre9">"He should be fine an' all,
but I feel a right mess. If only I coulda kep' him, this might
notta happen'd." Hagrid pulled Ginny in for a bear hug. "You
go on now, Ginny. Harry, I'm sorry 'bout before. Ye deserve any
happiness you can get. Both of ye." Hagrid turned around,
walking down the platform only to return with Ginny's trunk in his
arms.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh thanks, Hagrid," she
said, smiling at him. "So are we Apparating, Harry?" Harry
gave her a sheepish grin and shook his head.</p><p class="calibre9">"Nah," he answered.
"I drove."</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry! When did you leave
London?" London was hundreds of miles away and he drove here?</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, remember your
flying car?" he asked and she nodded. "Well, let's just
say that your dad helped me make some modifications to mine.."</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry! Dad got into so much
trouble for that!" she reminded him.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry looked at his feet and
shuffled them across the wooden platform sheepishly. "Well, it's
all legal, Gin. I, uh, pulled the 'Chosen One Card'."</p><p class="calibre9">She gave him a swat on the arm
in disgust. "Shame on you!" In all honesty, Ginny was
rather pleased with him. He never expected any of the attention or
accolades he received for what he did, even though he could have got
anything he wanted. For him to use his fame like this was funny and
she thought, deep down, that he really should have done it earlier.
Harry must have sensed that she was pleased with him and smiled at
her, chuckling slightly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hagrid, you want to see my car?
I don't think you've ever seen it," Harry asked his old
friend.</p><p class="calibre9">"No, s'okay, Harry. I
'spect I need ter get a move on wit' me duties. You have a safe
trip now, ye hear?" He patted the two of them on the head
lightly. Well, lightly for Hagrid. Ginny knew she would need
something for her headache when they got home.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry resumed levitating
Ginny's trunk and the two of them walked down the platform, their
hands firmly clasped together. As they walked, Ginny placed her head
on Harry's shoulder, feeling warmer and happier than she had in a
long time. Harry turned his head to kiss her hair softly while he
squeezed her hand in his. They walked in silence, but in Ginny's
mind talking would only distract her from the feelings she was
experiencing.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're quiet tonight."
Ginny realised they'd stopped walking and were already at the car.
He opened her door before going around to the boot with her trunk.</p><p class="calibre9">Once inside the car, Ginny was
engulfed in Harry's scent: woodsy with a touch of leather and a
light floral scent. She leaned into the driver's seat and breathed
deeply, closing her eyes as she smiled, remembering their times
together these last few months.</p><p class="calibre9">"My car smells?" Ginny's
head popped up and she saw him hiding a laugh behind his wide smile.</p><p class="calibre9">"No," she said, shaking her
head, "I just like your smell."</p><p class="calibre9">"My smell. How am I supposed to
take that?" He slid effortlessly into the driver's seat and
Ginny snuggled into the crook of his arm.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, you smellâ€¦"</p><p class="calibre9">"Now I smell," he chuckled
back, earning him a soft punch in the arm.</p><p class="calibre9">"Will you just shut up and let
me finish?" She eyed him warily as he clamped his mouth shut.
"You smell like leather from your jacket." Her finger ran
down the sleeve. "You smell like fresh air like when you ride
your broom." She lifted herself up and breathed deeply with her
nose in his hair. "You remind me of the scent of the flowering
fruit trees in the orchard at The Burrow." She nuzzled her nose
into his neck and quick as lightening, licked his warm skin and
sucked it into her mouth, making him squeal. With the widest grin
she'd ever known, Ginny pulled back and looked at Harry, giggling
to discover that he'd turned a nice shade of pink.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ah, it's a good smell,"
he said huskily. Harry reached over and tucked her hair behind her
ear and then rested his hand on her cheek. He was going to kiss her.
But she had an even better idea.</p><p class="calibre9">"Move."</p><p class="calibre9">"What?" His startled and
confused look was well worth it.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny tilted her head towards the
back of the car. "We never did get to try out the back seat,
Harry. Hermione always said it was fun." With a quick hop, Ginny
leapt to the back and with a quick swish and flick, enlarged the back
seat and lounged back, looking sexy, or at least she hoped she did.
"Come over here, Harry." She beckoned him with her index
finger and he gladly obliged.</p><p class="calibre9">"Miss Weasley, are you
trying to seduce me?" Harry ran his hand over her hair and soon
it was tangled inside, weaving around his fingers, as he pulled her
in for a kiss. Without any protest, Ginny melted into him and let
Harry control the kiss. She moaned as his strong tongue caressed
first her lips and then her own tongue before running alongside the
inside of her mouth tantalizingly slow. He pulled her to him and
leaned over so that he was lying on top of her, his knees on either
side of her supporting him as they kissed.</p><p class="calibre9">Hands, both Harry and Ginny's,
began roaming around their bodies, bringing forth moans of pleasure
and annoyance as clothing got in the way of eager hands. Ginny had
long ago removed her cloak and jumper, leaving her in a thin t-shirt
and jeans that were proving to be more of a hindrance than anything
else. Harry was bare-chested and breathing heavily into Ginny's
mouth as he kissed her, all the while sending shock waves of pleasure
through her body. Harry groaned in frustration as he tried to open
her bra without stopping their kiss. <em class="calibre8">When did I lose my top? </em></p><p class="calibre9">"Let me," she moaned into
him and playfully slapped his hands away and removed the offending
piece of lace and satin before tossing it to the side.</p><p class="calibre9">"You're beautiful, Ginny,"
Harry eeked out and fastened his lips to the nipple on her left
breast and his hand began massaging the other with gentle tugs
followed by stronger ones that brought another moan of pleasure from
her lips. Harry's mouth left her breasts and made their way down
her stomach until his lips touched her jeans.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry," Ginny whispered,
"take them off, please." She began wiggling her hips,
hoping to encourage him but all he could do was stare at her as he
moved to his knees at her feet.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, I, uhâ€¦" Before he
could finish, Ginny sat up and kissed him, knocking him against the
window of the car. Her fingers went to his fly to begin working on
the button and zipper. "Ginny! Stop it!" Harry grabbed her
wrists and pushed her back onto the seat. He looked terrified,
something she wasn't used to seeing.</p><p class="calibre9">She stared at him in disbelief.
"Harry, I'm ready." Ginny kneeled in front of him again,
rubbing her hard nipples against his hot skin. He let out a low
growl.</p><p class="calibre9">"No," he whispered, his
answer sounding more like a question than a statement. "Not now.
We've got to get back, Ginny. Your parents are expecting us and the
train's left already." Ginny turned around to the window and
wiped away the condensation, showing her an empty train station.</p><p class="calibre9">Her face fell and she suddenly
realised the amount of frustration she had caused Harry over the last
few months. Looking around at the interior of the car, she had to
admit it wasn't exactly where she wanted to have sex for the first
time. And he was right, her parents were expecting them and if they
got to The Burrow later than anticipated, there would be hell to pay.
Ginny reached for her clothing and silently redressed herself, not
wanting to meet his eyes. But he was quiet, too, she noted. Usually
he spouted off after she halted any of his advances but this was
different. He stopped her. Something was wrong.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry," Ginny began,
touching him lightly on the shoulder, "is something wrong?"
She bent forward to look into his eyes, searching for an answer. To
her surprise, he shrugged off her hand and crawled into the driver's
seat.</p><p class="calibre9">"You ready to go?"
Ginny nodded unenthusiastically and joined Harry in the front seat.
With a turn of the key, Harry started the engine and soon they were
in the air, the landscape of Scotland slowly giving way to the beauty
of the Lake District and then to the countryside of Devon. All the
while, the car was silent, save for the music from the CD player,
which was currently playing Def Leppard, Harry's favourite Muggle
band.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny wanted to fall asleep but she
was too anxious over Harry's demeanour and the sudden lack of
attention. She felt the jerk of the car as Harry began the car's
descent toward The Burrow and the sudden jolt of the landing.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sorry," Harry said
finally, looking at Ginny for the first time since they left the
station. As the car slowed to a halt, the remaining Weasley family
came tearing out of the house and very nearly ripped the passenger
door off its hinges.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny!" George tugged her
out of the vehicle and scooped her up into his arms. Ginny was
laughing so hard she didn't notice that she'd been passed along
to Fred who planted a wet kiss on her cheek. These were not her
brothers. These were some sort of poor imitation of the twins, and
she didn't like it one bit.</p><p class="calibre9">"Put me down!" she laughed.
Fred put her on the gravel and her mother then immediately swooped
upon her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank goodness you're home,
Ginny. I wasn't sure that I should have allowed Harry to pick you
up in that blasted car of his," she said quickly. "And look
at you! Have you grown?" Ginny was held at arms' length and
then was enveloped by her father.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi, Dad," she told him,
leaning in for a kiss on the cheek. "How's work?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Boring," he laughed. Ginny
turned around to look for Harry, but she only saw his back as he
entered the house. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught Fred and
George giggling hysterically and shyly pointing at her.</p><p class="calibre9">"What's the matter with you
two?" she asked them, getting angry at them. Both of them walked
over to her and leaned in close, one on either side.</p><p class="calibre9">"Just thought we'd tell you,"
Fred started.</p><p class="calibre9">"That we are very proud of
Harry." George looked at his twin with a toothy grin. Ginny
looked at them as if they were out of their minds.</p><p class="calibre9">"What?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Let's just say, sister dear,"
said George.</p><p class="calibre9">"That Harry's left his mark on
you. Right there." Fred put his finger on her neck, just below
her ear. Her hand replaced her brother's and Ginny felt her face
grow warm in embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre9">"She better make sure that
there aren't any others, right Fred?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Absolutely! Mum'll think
you're a scarlet woman or some other rubbish," Fred pointed
out.</p><p class="calibre9">"But we know you're as pure as
the driven snow," George said cheekily before taking off for the
house with Fred on his heels.</p><p class="calibre9">With a smile for her parents, Ginny
walked quietly to The Burrow, looking for Harry so she could corner
him and find out what was bothering him so much. He wasn't in the
sitting room or the kitchen. On her way up the stairs to her room,
she heard footsteps on the landing above her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry?" Ginny peered
up into the stairwell and caught a glimpse of his black hair. "Harry
can we talk?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Not now, Ginny, okay? I'm
tired." The sound of a door closing ended the conversation and
only served to increase her frustration.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Harry was uncharacteristically quiet
the rest of the evening as well. He'd taken a nap and at dinner,
barely said more than eight words to Ginny or anyone else. Her mother
tried unsuccessfully to engage Harry in conversation, answering her
in either yes or no. Ron, who arrived home right on time for dinner,
took note of Harry's mood.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Harry, what's the matter? You
look worse than when you got to Grimmauld that summer." It was
true. Harry was surly and made the rest of the family feel just as
morose.</p><p class="calibre9">"Nothing. Please excuse me,"
he announced, suddenly rising from his seat and headed up the stairs.</p><p class="calibre9">"What did you do to him, Ginny?"
Ron accused.</p><p class="calibre9">"I don't think she wants to
tell you what she did to him, Ron," Fred chirped.</p><p class="calibre9">"Boys! That's enough,"
their mother admonished. "Whatever is going on is none of your
business." She rose from the table and began collecting plates
and silverware. "Now you three come help me with the dishes."
A collective groan emerged from the mouths of Ron, Fred and George in
protest of their mother's orders.</p><p class="calibre9">"What about her?" Fred
nodded towards Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fred," his mother began,
"Ginny's going to cheer Harry up."</p><p class="calibre9">"I bet she does more than 'cheer
him up'?" George suggested lasciviously. Before George could
be scolded by either of his parents, Ginny shot a hex at her brother,
leaving him lying on the floor covered in bat bogeys, then left the
room, taking the stairs two at a time, not stopping until she stood
outside Ron's room, where she knew Harry would be. Not bothering to
knock, she entered the door to find Harry sitting in the middle of
the floor, looking at pictures from his time at Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hi Gin," he muttered not
bothering to turn around. "I thought you'd be up sooner or
later."</p><p class="calibre9">"So are you going to explain
your behaviour or do I have to drag it out of you?" She sat on
the floor next to him and picked up a picture, looking at it
carefully. "Is this from the Yule Ball?" Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre9">"I was miserable. Ron was
miserable. Neither of us were with who we wanted to be with."</p><p class="calibre9">"Neither was I, Harry. I really
wanted to go with you." She set the picture down and picked up
one taken at the third DA meeting. She smiled at the gathering of old
friends in the picture.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah, uh, sorry about that,
Ginny," he said softly, still not meeting her eyes. Harry took a
deep breath and took the picture from her hands. "You realise
how many of these people are gone?" He traced his fingers over
the faces of friends he'd lost: Lee Jordan, Terry Boot, Lisa Turpin
and Katie Bell. Gryffindor had been hit hard during the war, and
Ginny knew he still felt responsible.</p><p class="calibre9">"What brought this on?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I ran into Katie's mum the
other day at the Ministry. She was polite and told me how much Katie
liked me and that she was thankful that I let her have that extra
year and a half with her." Harry put his head on his hand and
continued. "Funny how keeping Katie alive that year at Hogwarts
meant so much to her."</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry, it's okay, you know.
That was a good thing." He nodded at her statement and finally
looked at her. "Can I ask you another question?"</p><p class="calibre9">"You can ask me anything,
Ginny," Harry reminded her, taking her hand and giving her a
weak smile.</p><p class="calibre9">"Is there anything else
bothering you? I mean, afterâ€¦uh, when we left the stationâ€¦"
Harry interrupted her with a heavy sigh.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm sorry about that."</p><p class="calibre9">"I know, but why, Harry? Why did
you stop talking to me the whole way home?" Ginny brushed the
fringe from his face and placed her hand on his chin, turning his
face to hers.</p><p class="calibre9">"Iâ€¦well, uh, I got scared,"
he told her. "You'd stopped me so many times and all of a
sudden there you were, ready and willing, and I froze. I don't know
what to do, Ginny. Maybe those people are right."</p><p class="calibre9">"What people?" Ginny
watched as Harry got up off the floor and began pacing, something he
did to help himself think.</p><p class="calibre9">"There's a rumour going around
about me."</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry, there've always
been rumours about you." Ginny got up and stopped his movements,
steering him over to the bed. "Usually you don't let them
bother you."</p><p class="calibre9">"These are different, Ginny.
They're personal." He looked away from her and began staring
out the window. "There are some people who think I'm notâ€¦
normal."</p><p class="calibre9">"Not normal? You mean likeâ€¦"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes!" His face began to
turn red and he ran both his hands through his hair. "I've
been receiving all sorts of stupid newspapers, mostly geared toward,
well, uhâ€¦"</p><p class="calibre9">"Men who fancy men?" Harry
nodded and she laughed out loud. "Well that's laughable! You
are very much in love with the female population."</p><p class="calibre9">"No." Ginny's eyes
grew wide in astonishment. "I'm in love with i <em class="calibre8">one /i </em>
female. I love i <em class="calibre8">you /i </em>, Ginny, not any other
i <em class="calibre8">female /i </em>, and certainly not any
i <em class="calibre8">bloke /i </em>."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny smiled at him, her eyes
beginning to fill with tears. "Then why are you worried about
it?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, I thought about some of
the things those papers said about me. I didn't kiss a girl until I
was fifteen. I was brought up in a not so loving home. I had no real
parental examples." He started pacing again. "And then
there's the fact that I live with Ron. People think that we're,
well, that Ron and I are, uh, together."</p><p class="calibre9">"Does Ron know about this? He'd
burst a vein if he ever heard that." Ginny began.</p><p class="calibre9">"No! He's got no clue! And
then at the gala, they made a big deal that you weren't there."</p><p class="calibre9">"Well that was your own doing,
Harry," she pointed out, stopping her movements and sitting back
on the bed.</p><p class="calibre9">"And that's what made me think
maybe I am," he admitted. "I mean, how many blokes would
stop their girlfriend when she's lying in front of them, nearly
naked, ready to fuck in the back of a car?" His eyes were wild
with something akin to fear. "I couldn't do it. If I was
really straight, we'd still be at the bloody station." Harry
sunk down onto the bed beside her and Ginny wrapped her arms around
him pulling him close to her.</p><p class="calibre9">"First off, Harry, Ron didn't
kiss anyone until he was almost seventeen. Now that's pathetic."
Harry chuckled. "Second, coming from a bad home environment
doesn't mean you'd be gay. I'm sure there are some who came
from very loving homes. Third, Ron lives with you because you don't
charge him rent." Harry chuckled a bit more and nodded his head.
"Fourth, Ron's been in love with Hermione for, what, almost
eight years. I think he'd notice by now if he didn't feel right.
And finally, just because you don't want to have sex when the
opportunity arisesâ€¦" Harry snorted this time. "â€¦merely
means you are a gentleman. And if I recall, you were the one who put
a halt to my advances when I stayed at your house before school
started."</p><p class="calibre9">"I did, didn't I? You
were all randy," he pointed out. "But it was because of
your dad."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes, I know," she said,
stroking his hair. "You respect me and my family. That surely
doesn't make you gay, Harry. Like I said, you're a gentleman."
Ginny let go of Harry and put her hands on his cheeks. "And I
love you, Harry Potter. More than anything else in the world."
Ginny leaned into Harry and they slowly, ever so slowly, met each
other's lips in a gentle kiss that promised everything, yet
delivered nothing but reverence.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mum!" came a shout from
the door. Ron had burst into his room loudly, causing Harry and Ginny
to jump apart. "Mum! Ginny's snogging in my room!"</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>It was the day before Easter
and Ginny couldn't recall being so excited. Charlie and his little
family were due to arrive any minute and she couldn't wait to see
her nephew.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Who does he look like, Mum?"
she asked her mother for the third time since arriving home.</p><p class="calibre9">Giving Ginny a little squeeze, her
mother told her, "Oh he's a strapping boy, dear. He has curly
red hair, like Charlie, and lovely green eyes like Amanda's."
A dreamy look came over her mother's face as she spoke of her
grandson. "He has the temper of a dragon, too, I might add.
Charlie has his hands full with that one." The new grandmother
had spent two weeks in Sweden with Kristoffer last month and she was
on a mission now to encourage Bill and Fleur to give her another
grandbaby.</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin, you'll love him. He's
a little fireball," Bill told her as he walked in from the
kitchen.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'd think he'd be more like
a Hungarian Horntail. Those buggers are wicked nasty," Harry
added, receiving a few laughs from those around him. "You say he
has red hair and green eyes?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Bright red hair, Harry,"
pointed out Ginny's father. "My hair used to be a bit like
that."</p><p class="calibre9">"A long time ago, Dad, huh?"
Fred ruffled his father's head from behind. There wasn't much
hair left, but Fred had made his point. "If he's cute, Harry,
then you'll get a good idea what your kids'll look like."
Harry coughed in shock, nearly choking on the chocolate egg he had in
his mouth.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fred, leave the poor boy
alone." He received a nudge on the shoulder from his mother as
she walked by.</p><p class="calibre9">A popping noise from the fireplace
drew the family's attention away from Fred and a letter flew into
the room. Fleur caught the parchment and handed it to Bill.</p><p class="calibre9">"It's from Charlie. They're
on their way!" The family and Harry looked expectantly out the
window and within a few seconds, Charlie and Amanda appeared near the
chicken coop. The room quickly emptied as the Weasleys ran out of the
house to join the new arrivals in the yard.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny was amazed at how tiny
Kristoffer was. After everyone greeted the newcomers, they were
escorted into the sitting room and the littlest Weasley was soon
making the rounds. Ginny now held him, admiring the tiny fingers with
their even tinier fingernails. He was alert and looked at her with
wide eyes and Ginny couldn't help but smile at him. Kristoffer held
one of her fingers tightly and made little gurgling noises as he did.
She was so involved with Kristoffer, Ginny didn't feel someone
touch her shoulder. It was Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">"I thought you might like
something to drink," he shyly said, holding a large glass for
her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks," she whispered.
Kristoffer was starting to fall asleep. "Wanna hold him?"
Ginny nearly laughed at the look of panic in Harry's eyes. "I
can't hold him and drink this, you know."</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh, yeah, right," he
stammered. "Lemme just put this down." Harry placed the
glass on the table in front of him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Here, now make sure you hold
his head." She leaned over and placed the baby in Harry's
shaky arms. "Good. Relax, Harry. He can't hurt you."</p><p class="calibre9">"I just don't want to hurt
him, that's all." Harry's finger went to the little boy's
hair, sweeping it to the side. Ginny watched as Harry's eyes
travelled over the little boy in his arms and the smile that was
forming on Harry's lips. It was surreal, actually, that Kristoffer
had green eyes and red hair. Fred was right. If she and Harry did
have children some day, she was sure one of them would certainly look
like Kristoffer.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny continued to watch Harry hold
Kristoffer and soon forgot about her pumpkin juice, she was so
absorbed in Harry. She leaned into Harry's shoulder and looked at
the baby as he slept, a chubby fist wrapped around Harry's thumb. .</p><p class="calibre9">"Gin," he whispered softly,
barely enough for her to hear him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah?" Ginny lifted her
eyes to Harry's.</p><p class="calibre9">"I love you." He smiled.
Ginny closed her eyes and breathed deeply.</p><p class="calibre9">"I love you, too, Harry,"
she answered and leaned up and kissed Harry softly on the lips. She
knew, at that moment, that nothing but good could come from her love
for Harry. When they broke apart, she laid her head on his shoulder
again, watching the baby sleep.</p><p class="calibre9">"Harry, Ginny, are you two
asleep, too?" It was Amanda. Ginny looked around and noticed the
shadows in the room had shrunk. They had fallen asleep.</p><p class="calibre9">"I guess we did," Ginny
said, half yawning in answer. "Should we wake them?"
Harry's head had fallen to the side and rested on his shoulder and
Kristoffer was still peacefully asleep in Harry's arm.</p><p class="calibre9">"No. Grab a blanket,
okay?" Amanda smiled, reassuring Ginny that it was fine with her
that Harry held her son. Ginny took the crocheted blanket from the
back of the sofa and laid it across Harry's lap, draping it across
his shoulder so that part of the soft covering lay across the baby.
"He looks nice holding him." Ginny's face grew warm.</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh, yeah." Ginny smiled at
them again. "He was scared to hold him, you know? But he got the
hang of it."</p><p class="calibre9">"Kris looks like he could be
yours and Harry's," Amanda observed, sitting down next to her
sister-in-law. "Oh, I heard about what Fred said. He's right.
Charlie said the same thing."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?" Ginny shook her
head, trying to get the thought of her and Harry having children out
of her mind.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yep, he did. You two are good
for each other. I saw it at the wedding," Amanda told her
quietly as they continued to watch the pair sleeping. "Harry's
smitten, Ginny. He's in it for the long haul. I'm sure of it."
Amanda patted Ginny's shoulder and gathered her son in her arms,
leaving a sleeping Harry to pull the blanket over his other shoulder
and lay down against the arm of the sofa.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny got up from the sofa and kissed
Harry lightly on the cheek, and turned off the light next him. As she
left the room, she took one last look and smiled, knowing, some how,
that she and Harry would have their own turn. Some day.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>After Easter, Harry had to return to
London as he only had a few days off from training. He reassured
Ginny that he was fine and that he had settled things in his mind.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"So, we play Ravenclaw in May.
Could be for the Cup. Will you be there?" Ginny looked up at
Harry's eyes, wanting to remember every detail until they could be
together again. The sunlight of that April morning was reflecting
brilliantly off the irises of his eyes, making them look like
sparkling jewels.</p><p class="calibre9">"Wild hippogriffs couldn't
stop me." Harry kissed her lightly on the tip of her nose and
turned to open the car door. "Study hard, love. NEWTs are coming
up quick."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really means a lot coming from
someone who never took them." Ginny smiled as she leaned into
the open window of the car, not wanting to say goodbye. "Hermione
gave me her study notes, so I think I should be fine."</p><p class="calibre9">"Good. Well," Harry began,
touching her softly on the cheek, "I've got to get going.
There's only two and a half months left, right?" Ginny nodded,
fighting back the tears that were building. "Hey now, don't do
that."</p><p class="calibre9">"I can't help it. I love you
so much, Harry."</p><p class="calibre9">"I know. I love you, too. But
it's not that long. You'll be so busy with studying for exams
that you won't have time to miss me," he told her
optimistically. Ginny gave him a small smile and stepped away from
the car.</p><p class="calibre9">"You go now. Fly safely, okay?"
He nodded and started the engine. Ginny wrapped her arms around
herself, trying to hold in the warmth of his touch while she watched
him drive down the gravel road, leaving only a cloud of dust behind
him. She startled as someone touched her shoulder. Ginny turned
around to find Charlie standing beside her, his arm around her
shoulders.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hey there, Midget." He
hadn't called her that in years. "You okay?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I think so. I just hate leaving
him." She sighed and pulled her jumper tightly around her.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, I think he'll be just
fine, Midget. Can I talk to you?" Ginny turned to look at her
brother, curious as to what Charlie would want to talk to her about.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah, Charlie. On the tree
swing?" The two of them quietly walked across the grass and sat
on the creaky old swing, which happened to be Ginny's favourite
place to think about things, especially Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well, uh, Amanda told me to
talk to you."</p><p class="calibre9">"About what? Why couldn't
she talk to me herself?" She thought Amanda knew her well enough
to talk to her about anything. Was she wrong?</p><p class="calibre9">"Kristoffer. He needs a
godmother." Ginny's jaw dropped.</p><p class="calibre9">"Me? You're kidding, right?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No. We want you to be his
godmother. Sven had agreed to be godfather, and we wanted someone
from my family, too," Charlie told her. Sven was Amanda's
younger brother and a year older than Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">"But why me? Is it because I'm
the only female?" Ginny asked him, bringing a smile to her
brother's face.</p><p class="calibre9">"A bit, but not much," he
answered. "Bill has his hands full already. And would you trust
Gred and Forge with a kid?" Ginny shook her head. "And as
much as I love Ron, he's a tad insecure around my son. He did,
after all, almost drop him the other day."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah, I remember. He didn't
want Hermione getting any ideas by seeing him holding a baby."
Ginny rolled her eyes in annoyance. "Hermione has her own ideas
about that without Ron putting any there."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh yeah. While she loves Ron
and all, she really doesn't want to get married for a while. She
wants to work and travel before she settles down. Don't tell Mum,
but she told me once that you were onto something living with
Amanda." Charlie was taken aback by her comment.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hermione wants to follow in my
footsteps? Oh my. I don't think Mum'd like two of her boys
getting in the family way before it's all legal." Ginny nodded
but smiled at him before she spoke.</p><p class="calibre9">"No, no, no. Mum scared
both of them after we found out about <em class="calibre8">you</em>, Charles."
Ginny was the only one who could get away with calling Charlie by his
full name. "In fact, thanks to you, all of us got these lovely
lectures from Mum and Dad, and you can probably imagine how
comfortable that was."</p><p class="calibre9">"Ah yes. But did you know that
Mum did the same thing?"</p><p class="calibre9">"What?!?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Do they not teach maths these
days? Can't you add, Gin? Bill was born almost six months to the
day after Mum and Dad were married." Ginny's jaw dropped for
the second time that afternoon. "You mean you didn't know
that?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No," she said flatly. "You
forget that I am the innocent princess, Charlie. Mum would prefer to
think that I remain a virgin until my first child is conceived."
Ginny laughed at the look Charlie gave her.</p><p class="calibre9">"I'd rather not think of you
doing that, sis," Charlie pointed out. He cleared his throat and
began again, in a more serious tone. "Are you, Ginny? Are you
and Harryâ€¦"</p><p class="calibre9">"No," she blurted
out, feeling her cheeks warm at Charlie's question. "Harry
doesn't have a death wish, Charlie." There was no way she was
going to tell her brother what she and Harry <em class="calibre8">had</em> done, that
was for sure. She didn't have a death wish, either.</p><p class="calibre9">"Understandable. Just when you
do, make sure it's right. For the both of you," Charlie said
softly, his own cheeks reddening in embarrassment. Ginny smiled at
him, grateful that she could talk to at least one of her brothers
about something like this. She missed him a lot when he was in
Romania. He wasn't around much during the war, and shortly after,
he moved to Sweden, coming home on the occasional holiday.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thanks, Charlie. I know. I love
him, you know. I can't think of anyone else that I would even think
about doing that with." Ginny patted Charlie's hand before she
stood up. "Come on. I think Mum is going to corner Tonks pretty
soon and we all know that Mum will hover over Tonks like she never
got to with Amanda."</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh, yes, Midget. We must go
rescue the war heroine and her war hero husband from the baker of
fine pastries," Charlie said with a chuckle. "Just wait
until Fleur has a turn."</p><p class="calibre9">"The apocalypse. I tell you,
Charlie, that'll be the apocalypse."</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The returning train ride to Hogwarts
was filled with chatter about Ginny's new nephew. In the
compartment with Luna, Colin, Dennis and Demelza, Ginny passed around
photos and rambled on about the new addition to the Weasley clan. She
mentioned her new role as godmother, and was proud as a mother hen.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny was the first seventh-year to
return to the dormitory at the top of the stairs that night and was
grateful for the return to what she considered normalcy. As she lay
on her bed, reflecting on her holiday, she heard a sob from the other
side of her bed followed by the popping of a cork. Ginny sat up and
made her way to Sarah's bed. Ginny remembered that Sarah stayed
here during the break, and she almost forgot about the frame Sarah
gave her as she was leaving the tower. Suddenly, a terrible thought
entered Ginny's head and she tore back the curtains of Sarah's
four-poster bed. She was shocked by what she found.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's eye immediately went to the
now empty bottle with the cork lying on the top of the sheets. Her
gaze travelled up to the still form of Sarah Mitchell, who was
clutching a note in one hand as she lay still.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sarah! Sarah wake up!"
Ginny shook the girl, hoping to rouse her from whatever sleep she was
in, silently praying that she just took a sleeping draught and didn't
do what Ginny most feared. Ginny ran to the door of the room and
stuck her head out into the corridor. "HELP! Someone help us in
here! Get Professor Lupin!"</p><p class="calibre9">She ran back to the room and again
tried to shake Sarah awake. The sound of footsteps thundering up the
stairs was soon followed by the entire female population of
Gryffindor Tower. Enid ran to Ginny's side and stopped short as she
reached the bed.</p><p class="calibre9">"NO-O-O! SARAH!" The girl
leapt onto the bed next to Sarah and placed her ear next to Sarah's
mouth and nose. "Quiet! All of you!" The chatter and crying
stopped as Enid tried to listen for Sarah's breathing. Enid let out
a large sigh before saying, "She's breathing. But just barely.
Where is Lupin?!?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny looked toward the door,
willing Professor Lupin to run into the room and take over. She felt
herself shaking in fear and shock. She had seen people die in the
war, but this, this was different. Sarah did this to herself.
Hundreds upon hundreds of questions were racing through Ginny's
mind as she tried to come up with a reason why Sarah would do this
to herself. The slam of the heavy door drew Ginny from her thoughts,
causing her to turn around and find both Tonks and Remus charging
into the room.</p><p class="calibre9">"What's happened? Who's
hurt?" Lupin skidded to a halt as he noticed who was lying on
the bed.</p><p class="calibre9">"What happened here?"
Tonks chimed in, her eyes darted around the crowd of girls, all
scared and looking frightfully white. "Remus, you get her to the
Hospital Wing." Not needing further instruction, Remus scooped
Sarah up into his arms and took off down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre9">As soon as Lupin left the room, Tonks
took control of the situation. "What happened? Does anyone
know?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Iâ€¦I heard her cryâ€¦crying,"
Ginny spat put between quick breaths as she fought to keep her
composure. "And then I heard a cork pop." Ginny looked onto
the bed and saw the empty phial and cork. She reached over and picked
them up in her hands, giving them to Tonks.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, come with me. The rest
of you, go to the Common Room. I'll send up Professor McGonagall.
And for Merlin's sake, PRAY!" Tonks shoved the items into the
pocket of her oversized shirt and pulled Ginny by the arm and led her
out the door.</p><p class="calibre9">The two of them nearly flew down the
many flights of stairs and Ginny couldn't help but wonder if this
was good for Tonks, especially in her condition. Tonks slammed the
portrait hole open and pulled Ginny away from the stairs toward a
corridor on the left.</p><p class="calibre9">"Tonks! Itâ€¦it's theâ€¦wr-wrong
way!" Ginny stopped and bent at the waist, trying to catch her
breath.</p><p class="calibre9">"No, Ginny." Tonks was
barely out of breath. "There's an emergency portal to the
Hospital Wing over here. Come ON. Let's go!" Tonks took off
again and Ginny had no choice but follow her to a cluster of small
statues Ginny had never really noticed before. "Stand next to
me." Ginny followed Tonks' instruction and as soon as Tonks
snapped her fingers, the two of them were in the Hospital Wing.</p><p class="calibre9">"Mrs. Lupin! What happened? Did
anyone see?" Ginny watched as Madam Pomfrey charged over to
them, peppering both Ginny and Tonks with questions Ginny had no idea
how to answer.</p><p class="calibre9">At some point that night, Ginny
was placed in a chair while Lupin, Tonks and Madam Pomfrey huddled
around the sleeping form of Sarah Mitchell. Ginny tried to listen to
their conversation, but she was fighting a more powerful foe than
curiosity; sleep.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny awoke to hear a murmured
conversation across the room. Focusing on the voices, Ginny
discovered that Professor Lupin was speaking with Sarah's mother.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"She took it so hard when he
died, Professor. But she didn't want to miss school," Sarah's
mother explained in a tearful voice. "Sheâ€¦she loves it here,
and I thought it would be the best place for her."</p><p class="calibre9">"Why didn't she come and speak
with me about this, Mrs. Mitchell? I would have given her all the
time she needed to come to terms with this."</p><p class="calibre9">"Sarah doesn't like to burden
people with her problems. I tried convincing her to stay home for a
few days, but she refused." Mrs. Mitchell sniffed again. "I
couldn't force her to stay."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes, I know." Remus sighed
heavily. "Here, let's get you into this chair. Madam Pomfrey
says Sarah will wake up in a few hours." Ginny watched as
Professor Lupin guided Sarah's mother to the fluffy chair next to
the bed. "You get some rest. Do you want a sleeping potion,
Claudia?" The woman shook her head and smiled as Remus conjured
a patchwork quilt and tucked it around her. He patted her on the
shoulder and began walking toward Ginny.</p><p class="calibre9">"Are you awake, Ginny?"
Remus stood at Ginny's right and looked down at her, his face
highlighted by the light from the waning moon.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes. Why did she do that,
Remus?" Ginny could feel hot tears begin to make their way down
her cheeks. "What happened?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Come with me. We'll talk on
the way back to the Tower." Ginny got off the chair, feeling
chilly from the sudden loss of the chair's warmth. Once they were
outside the room, Remus spoke again. "Her father died over the
Christmas holiday."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny paused and looked up at her
friend and teacher. "She never said anything, Remus. Why didn't
she say anything?" Remus ushered her back down the corridor,
continuing on their journey.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny, I don't know. People
react differently when faced with a great loss." Ginny
remembered how Harry felt after Sirius died and how other people she
knew handled the death of a loved one. Every person was different and
there was no way to predict how they would handle the situation.</p><p class="calibre9">"I just don't understand why
she would do that. What could make her lose hope like that?"
Ginny knew there were no answers to her questions, and really, the
only who held those answers was Sarah herself. It certainly wasn't
very Gryffindor of Sarah, Ginny thought to herself, and tried to put
those kinds of thoughts away as they reached the Portrait Hole and
said goodnight to Remus.</p><p class="calibre9">Back in her bed, Ginny couldn't
help but think that if she had been a bit more tolerant of Sarah,
this may not have happened. Sighing heavily into the darkness of her
curtained bed, Ginny closed her eyes and willed those thoughts to
leave her mind, slowly drifting off to sleep.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's dreams were troubled
that night as images of a dead Sarah asking her why she took so long
to find her. Ginny was haunted by dreams of a similar theme all night
leaving her tired, sweaty and shaking when morning finally came.
Ginny sat up, deciding a cold shower was necessary that morning and
vowed to figure out the whys of Sarah's actions.</p>
