			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">One Year</strong><br class="calibre6"/>
Chapter Eleven:<br class="calibre6"/>
<em class="calibre8">June</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>In
addition to her NEWT exams, the month of June brought Ginny to
perhaps the most nerve-wracking experiences of her life: her
appointment with a Muggle neurologist.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Now
look this way…"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's
eyes moved to the left, and the doctor's light shone brightly in her
eyes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Now
put your hands out to the side and alternate touching your nose."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's
arms went up and she performed for the doctor. It felt rather silly
to be touching her nose. She thought for sure that the exam would be
much different.</p><p class="calibre9">"Good.
Now hands on your sides and stand on one foot then the other."
The doctor stepped back to observe Ginny's balance. "Now have a
seat. We're done with this part."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
hopped onto the exam table and watched the doctor nervously as he
jotted notes on her chart.</p><p class="calibre9">"Okay,
now could you tell me about the accident again?" he asked
without looking up.</p><p class="calibre9">"Er,
well it happened during a Quidditch match--"</p><p class="calibre9">"You
play Quidditch! My sister played when she was at Hogwarts! It's an
amazing sport! What position do you play?" His eyes were wide,
and Ginny could feel his excitement.</p><p class="calibre9">"Seeker."</p><p class="calibre9">"Really?
Amazing. Adrienne got the Headmaster to allow us to see one of her
matches, and it was fabulous. She was a, what do you call it, a
Chooser?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Chaser,
sir. Well, the accident happened as I was diving for the Snitch…"
Ginny continued with the explanation of what'd happened, not
allowing any pauses in which Dr. Haworth-Smith could interrupt.</p><p class="calibre9">"Was
this your first concussion?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
sir. I had one back when I was sixteen. I was, er, fighting someone."
Ginny had a difficult time thinking of the right words to describe
the battle of her life against Bellatrix Lestrange. "And I got
knocked out."</p><p class="calibre9">"Uh-huh."
He nodded as he wrote down more notes. "Well, I am going to
order a CT scan and possibly an MRI."</p><p class="calibre9">"What?
What's that?" Whatever they were, they didn't sound very fun.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
I'm sorry. They are electronic scans of the brain. They'll let us see
if there is any underlying damage, and then we'll be able to figure
out what's going on." Dr. Smith gave her a reassuring smile. "It
won't hurt, I promise. It's all very routine." The doctor stood
and headed toward the door. "I'll go get your parents and your
brother, then."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
watched him leave the room, and she barely contained her giggle upon
hearing the doctor refer to Harry as her brother. There was nothing
brotherly in how she felt about him in the least.</p><p class="calibre9">The
door opened again and in walked her parents and Harry, who walked up
to her and kissed her soundly on the lips, making the doctor do a
double take.</p><p class="calibre9">"He's
not my brother, Doctor. Harry's my boyfriend," Ginny informed
the gob smacked doctor.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
well then. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ginny will need to undergo some
brain scans to determine what is troubling her. I'll have the nurse
take you all to the radiology lab." He smiled briefly at them.
"Any questions?"</p><p class="calibre9">"What
exactly does this test do?" asked Ginny's father with an excited
look on his face.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
it takes pictures of the brain-"</p><p class="calibre9">"Amazing…"
her father interrupted.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
suppose, yes. It gives us a good image of the whole brain, and from
there we'll be able to tell if there is anything wrong physically.
I think it is rather unfortunate that the folks at St. Mungo's
haven't tried something like this." Dr. Haworth-Smith's eyes lit
up at the mention of his sister's workplace.</p><p class="calibre9">"Muggle
medicine isn't well received in certain parts of our world,"
Harry told the doctor. "Mr. Weasley here had stitches a few
years back, and Ginny's mum was mortified." Harry nudged Ginny
as they watched her mother blush.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
let's get this going then, alright?" The doctor stood and
ushered them out of the room.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny,
her parents, and Harry walked out the clinic doors, relieved that
there was nothing seriously wrong with her. Dr. Haworth-Smith had
explained that Ginny suffered from Post-Concussion Syndrome, which
affected a small percentage of people. With her prescription
anti-depressants, things should get better for her in a few weeks.
She still needed to take breaks throughout the day, but otherwise,
she didn't have to do anything different.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Once
the foursome reached the Leaky Cauldron, they stepped in front of the
Apparation point of the pub and Disapparated, reappearing in the
village of Hogsmeade. Professor McGonagall had allowed Ginny the day
off from classes in order to see the doctor.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
dear, would you like your father and I to walk you up to the gates?"
asked her mother, a much more relaxed person than she had been a few
hours before.</p><p class="calibre9">"That
would be fine, Mum," she answered, but her eyes kept drifting
toward Harry. Even though they spent the day together, they really
had no opportunity to talk.</p><p class="calibre9">"Molly,
I think they'll be fine. Let's get home." Her father's voice was
deep, and if Ginny wasn't mistaken, she could have sworn her father's
hand was caressing her mother's backside. <em class="calibre8">Block the image, block
it NOW</em>.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
yes. There was that, er, thing that needed doing."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
watched her mother blush, and she wished that she wasn't standing
there listening to her parents' sexual innuendo and watching her
father feel up her mother. She initiated the goodbyes and soon she
and Harry were walking toward the castle hand in hand.</p><p class="calibre9">"Did
you see where your dad's hand was?" asked Harry in an amused
voice.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,"
Ginny replied in a not-so-amused voice. "Put your hand back here
and make me forget what I saw, Potter."</p><p class="calibre9">She
reached out and pulled him to her, pressing her lips to his,
effectively driving those particular images from her mind. Harry
willingly opened his mouth when her tongue met his lips. Ginny
continued to dominate the kiss and pushed Harry down to the grass,
straddling his hips and still kissing him.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny…hey!"
Harry sat up with Ginny still in his lap. "What's up with you?
Not that I'm complaining or anything, but what brought this on?"
His eyes searched hers for an answer, and his hand stroked her cheek.
She closed her eyes at the sensations he was causing.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
guess I'm just happy that there isn't anything really wrong with me,
you know? Now that I know what's going on," she said hurriedly,
"things can only get better, right?" She smiled widely at
him as she finished speaking.</p><p class="calibre9">"There's
m'girl. There's my Gin," Harry purred before leaning in for
another kiss. He stood and pulled her up beside him with his arm
around her waist. "But as much as I'd like to stay, I have to
get you back up to the castle. McGonagall has me on a short leash
after December." The memory made Ginny smile.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah,
well, that wasn't entirely your fault, you know."</p><p class="calibre9">"I'd
rather not push it," Harry leaned down and rested his forehead
on hers. "You need to get back up there, Gin."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
sighed and nodded her head. "Go ahead. Send up Bambi."
Harry'd shown her the Muggle movie earlier that summer, and she loved
referring to his Patronus as the lovable cartoon stag.</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
stepped away from her, took out his wand, sending the brilliant stag
into the air. Once it trotted away, all they could do was wait for
someone to arrive at the gate and let them in.</p><p class="calibre9">The
two of them waited in awkward silence, hand in hand, until they saw a
glowing form coming across the field.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
is that?" Ginny asked, her hand pointing out toward the castle.
"Isn't that Remus' Patronus?" The two of them watched as
the form of a wolf trotted toward them.</p><p class="calibre9">The
silvery wolf stared at Harry, opened its mouth, and whispered into
Harry's ear. Harry nodded and the form dissolved into the cool air of
the early evening.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
was that all about?" Ginny looked back over at the castle,
wondering why no one had come when Harry called.</p><p class="calibre9">"Apparently,
there was an explosion in the kitchens."</p><p class="calibre9">"What?
Was anyone hurt? What about Dobby? Winky?" This was
unbelievable. Things like this just didn't happen at Hogwarts. There
were too many protective spells around the castle.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
it appears my ownership of Kreacher has ended," Harry said with
a touch of moroseness. "He's dead."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
let out an involuntary laugh. "Sorry, Harry, but I'd think you'd
be relieved."</p><p class="calibre9">Harry
returned her laugh and nodded. "Looks like the staff are still
trying to sort things out, so Remus sent the spell to unlock the gate
with his Patronus." Harry took out his wand and whispered so
softly that Ginny was unable to hear anything. The wrought iron gates
creaked open eerily, just wide enough for Ginny to enter. "Well,
I'll see you."</p><p class="calibre9">"What
spell was it, Harry?" Ginny teased him, curious as to what sorts
of spells the teachers used to protect them.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
can't, and you know that. It'll be changed once you get inside
anyway." Harry smirked at her, making Ginny roll her eyes at
him. "Now get on up there." He kissed her quickly on the
cheek and ushered her through the gate, making it shut harshly behind
her. "You need Hedwig tomorrow?" He grasped her hand
through the gate.</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
shook her head and kissed his knuckles. "I love you, Harry."</p><p class="calibre9">"Me,
too," he answered with a hint of a blush. Ginny stepped away and
their fingers disentangled from each other, and she reluctantly made
her way back to the castle.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
rubbed her temple for what seemed like the tenth time in five
minutes, the headache pounding mercilessly against it. But this
headache wasn't from her injury. She had been studying non-stop for
the past two hours in the library. NEWT's were scheduled to begin
on Monday, and this was just not the way she wanted to spend a
beautiful Saturday in June. But her determination was winning out,
despite her inner protests. She wanted to succeed in this more than
anything, and a bloody headache wasn't going to get in her way.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">She
slid lower on her chair and pulled her Defence textbook closer to
her. She knew most of this already, thanks to practical experience,
but wanted to make sure she did her best. She was determined to give
Percy a run for his money.</p><p class="calibre9">The
sharp sounds of heels against the hard floor distracted her from her
reading, and she looked up to see Madam Pince standing before her,
lips pursed in her usual manner.</p><p class="calibre9">"Miss
Weasley," the woman began, "Professor McGonagall wishes to
see you in her office."</p><p class="calibre9">"Now?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Now,"
Pince replied curtly and turned around sharply, heading off in the
opposite direction.</p><p class="calibre9">With
a huff, Ginny stood up and gathered her things into her bag, nearly
spilling her ink in her haste.</p><p class="calibre9">It
felt good to be out of the library, and if she was truly honest with
herself, she would admit she was tired of studying anyway. She
glanced longingly out the windows that lined the halls and wished
beyond anything that she could be outside flying, preferably with
Harry. She missed that, flying, almost as much as she missed him. She
hadn't got on a broom since her accident, and that fact frightened
her. She shook the thought out of her head and made her way to the
headmistress's office.</p><p class="calibre9">She
rode the now familiar stairs up to the office and saw Professor
McGonagall actually happy, smiling broadly even. What put her in such
good mood?</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny.
Please, sit down." She walked over to the hard wooden chair that
sat in front of the efficient-looking wooden desk, with nary a paper
out of place. It was so typical of the woman.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
wanted to see me, Professor?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes.
I have just returned from a meeting with Madam Pomfrey, Healer Malory
and Doctor Haworth-Smith. We have come up with a schedule for your
exams, so they will not tax you too much," the professor
informed her.</p><p class="calibre9">This
was rather unexpected, as Ginny had no idea this would be happening.
It was also a surprise that McGonagall would go along with any change
to the test schedule.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
will take your theory exams in the library with breaks every
forty-five minutes. Your time allotment will be the same as your
classmates, and since your surname is at the end of the alphabet, you
will finish in time for your practical exams." Professor
McGonagall handed Ginny a piece of parchment with her timetable.
"Professor Lupin will oversee all of your exams and will also
administer any medications, should you require them. Does that sound
agreeable?"</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
didn't know what to say. "Er, sure. Thank you, Professor."
She smiled weakly at the headmistress.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
are very welcome, Miss Weasley. I was happy to do it."</p><p class="calibre9">"You're
kidding." McGonagall raised an eyebrow at Ginny's comment. "What
I mean, Professor, is that you are usually pretty, well, er…"</p><p class="calibre9">"Strict?"
McGonagall smiled at her. "Ginny, this is not your fault. You
are a bright student, and any accommodations that were made are not
out of favouritism. They are from a willingness to allow you to do
your best on your exams."</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank
you. I really appreciate it." Ginny's smile grew wider, and she
could swear that McGonagall's eyes twinkled.</p><p class="calibre9">"Now
go outside. The fresh air will do you good." Professor
McGonagall put her hands on Ginny's shoulders and turned her around
to face the door. "You've been staying inside far too much."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
left the office with a light heart, determined to take the advice.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Monday
morning was bright, cheerful and all the annoying things it could be
for the first day of exams. Ginny awoke early, even before Enid, who
liked to get up at 5 am for some ungodly reason. She lay on her bed,
staring at the ceiling, her stomach a swirl of nerves. She knew she
wouldn't be able to get back to sleep and rolled out of bed to head
for the bathroom.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">When
she returned to the room, Enid was awake and playing with Hedwig, who
was perched on the chair next to Ginny's bed.</p><p class="calibre9">"She's
a beautiful bird," Enid cooed, stroking Hedwig and eliciting a
soft hoot from the snowy owl.</p><p class="calibre9">"Isn't
she? I'm a bit protective of her since she got sick in November,"
Ginny told Enid. "Morning, baby," Ginny told Hedwig and
bent down to untie the note that was attached to her leg. "How've
you been? Harry's been staying out of trouble, I hope." Ginny
reached into the drawer of her bedside table and pulled out a treat
before Hedwig perched herself on top of the window sill.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ready
for today, Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre9">"As
ready as I'll ever be. You?" Ginny unrolled the letter but laid
it in her lap, waiting for Enid to leave.</p><p class="calibre9">"Nervous
as hell." Enid smiled and grabbed her bathroom items, leaving
Ginny to read her letter.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">Morning,
Sunshine</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">So,
it's the big day. You'll do well, I know it. I wish I could give you
a kiss for luck, but if I did, you'd be late for your first exam.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">I
can't believe this year is almost over. I'm excited that you'll be
finished with school and you can spend more time with me. I don't
know if I told you this, but the time we had together in Sweden was
the best time I've ever had. It was amazing, seeing you everyday and
being with you, even if it was just listening to music or Quidditch
on the wireless. Ron would laugh if he ever found out I'm saying
this, but I don't think I could handle being apart from you much
longer…I love you so much, Gin, and I really don't think there's
going to be anyone else for me. You're it. Always and forever. I know
this is a lot to throw at you at one time, but I wanted you to know
this before you go back home. I'm going to be there for a month, in
between sessions. I can't think of a better way to spend a month than
with you.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Hermione
has an idea. She'd like you to move in with her. I think it would be
bloody brilliant. Think about it. Sweet talk your mum. Put on those
puppy dog eyes and turn on the charm like you do with me…but
different.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Good
luck this week, and remember I love you.</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Harry</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
wiped a stray tear that escaped her eye and hugged the letter to her
body. With a sob, she curled on her side and cried happy tears.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Later
that morning, it was eerily quiet as she walked into the Great Hall
for breakfast. A number of students were hunched over their
breakfast, frantically re-reading notes from the past year. It was
exactly what Ginny was planning on doing as well.</p><p class="calibre9">She
stepped up to the Gryffindor table and took a seat across from Colin,
who was idly munching on a piece of bacon that hung from his mouth,
leaving his hands free to rustle through the unorganised mess he
called notes.</p><p class="calibre9">"Can
you even find anything in there?" she asked, pouring cream on
her porridge. She watched as Colin nodded, the bacon wagging like a
dog's tail.</p><p class="calibre9">"Asowutwee,"
he muttered with the bacon still in his teeth. Ginny smiled and
opened her notebook, scanning the pages to get in some last minute
studying.</p><p class="calibre9">So
absorbed was she in her reviewing, she jumped when she heard
Professor McGonagall begin to speak.</p><p class="calibre9">"Attention,
please. I remind all students that today marks the beginning of your
final exams as well as OWLs for the fifth-years and NEWTs for the
seventh-years. Fifth and seventh year students are to remain in the
Entrance Hall until it is time for the exams to begin." She
cleared her throat and then continued. "Conversation in the
hallways will be kept to a minimum, and the corridors will be
patrolled in between classes. Now off you go."</p><p class="calibre9">The
sound of benches scraping the stone floor echoed through the Great
Hall. Ginny made her way through the mob of students and caught up
with Luna. The two of them found a quiet corner and people-watched
for a while, trying to relax.</p><p class="calibre9">"Should
we get out the Extendable Ears, Lu? I need something to take my mind
off things," Ginny suggested, even as she began searching for
them in her bag.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
wouldn't that be interesting."</p><p class="calibre9">The
two of them each took an earpiece and began strolling about the
Entrance Hall, pretending to gossip as they listened to their fellow
seventh-years.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"The
third use of dragon's blood is as a stabiliser for Veritaserum…"
</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Too
boring. The girls continued on.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"Monkshood
is the same thing as wolfsbane…"</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny
shook her head at the girl's inane chatter about first year Potions
knowledge.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"So
you wanna meet me at the North Astronomy Tower? We could finish up
where we left off last night…"</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Will
you do that thing you do with your tongue?" </em></p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
and Luna gave each other silly looks and slowed their walking,
continuing to listen to the racy conversation.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"Are
you sure this thing'll work? I remember Granger confiscating it back
in fourth year…"</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny
chuckled at the memory of hearing about the things Hermione, as a
Gryffindor prefect, had confiscated in the days prior to her own OWL
exams.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><em class="calibre8">"I
hear Jonathan Martin got some girl pregnant. That's why he got
expelled."</em><p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">That
comment made them stop in their tracks. Ginny thought for sure that
the stories about Jonathan had all worn out. This one was a new
rumour.</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Nah,
that's not right. Remember, he was found in the cave down by the
village."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Wasn't
he with a woman from the village? He was about to…well, you know."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"I
think so. Luckily, Lupin got there in time."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"So,
how did he know? It's not like the man is a bobby or anything. D'you
think it was a student?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Now
that I think about it, I'm pretty sure it was a student. Wonder who?"</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"He
was pretty out there, so I wonder if it was an ickle third-year he
lured out there to get his jollies with."</em></p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">"Ugh,
don't make me think about it anymore. He was one of Malfoy's cronies,
if I recall. Had a bit of a nasty streak, I'd say."</em></p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>Ginny
felt a tug on her sleeve, which pulled her attention away from the
boy's conversation. She looked up to see Luna, pointing to the
doors of the Great Hall. Professor Flitwick stood on his usual stool,
about to instruct the students.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny
rolled her eyes at Flitwick's reminders about Auto-Answer Quills,
Detachable Cribbing Cuffs, and Self-Correcting Ink before ushering
her classmates and the fifth-years into the Great Hall. Before Luna
turned to leave, Ginny pulled her into a hug, whispering, "Good
luck."</p><p class="calibre9">Luna
smiled and patted Ginny on the back, then they parted, Luna for the
Great Hall and Ginny to the library.</p><p class="calibre9">At
the library, she was greeted by Professor Lupin's toothy grin. He'd
been smiling a lot more these days. <em class="calibre8">Couldn't have anything to do
with impending fatherhood, could it</em>? Ginny thought with a grin of
her own.</p><p class="calibre9">"Good
morning, Professor."</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,
it is, Ginny. Yes, it is," he answered.</p><p class="calibre9">"Well,
you're not taking exams now, are you?" Ginny reminded him. His
eyes finally lost their glaze, and he began to look more like
himself.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
suppose not." He held the door open for her, and she entered the
eerily quiet library. There were no students, no noise. Not even an
errant ghost floating about waiting to distract a studying group of
students. Standing by the desk was Madam Pince, her arms crossed and
wearing her traditional pursed lip look. She was a little ray of
sunshine, she was.</p><p class="calibre9">"Lupin,"
she muttered, her lips barely coming apart. "Miss Weasley,
please come with me." Pince began walking away from her, and
Ginny hurried to catch up. "No running in the library."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
followed the librarian to a small alcove containing a large desk, a
wooden chair, a settee, and a pitcher of water with matching glasses.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
you didn't have to get me the comfy couch for my exams, Irma! That
was so sweet," Ginny teased, flinging herself onto the hideous
floral upholstery. She immediately cringed inwardly, and silently
cursed her moods and her condition.</p><p class="calibre9">"Miss
Weasley! Show some respect, my dear. It's only because the
headmistress asked me that I am allowing the two of you to disrupt my
library." The haggard-looking woman glared at Ginny, clearly
awaiting an apology.</p><p class="calibre9">"Irma,
Minerva and I thank you for these arrangements," Lupin began,
his voice even and deep. "I am sure Miss Weasley appreciates it
as well, don't you, Miss Weasley."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
felt her cheeks warm up at the remark and cleared her throat before
speaking. "Yes, thank you, ma'am." She got up and settled
herself in the wooden chair and retrieved her quills and ink, setting
them carefully on the desk.</p><p class="calibre9">"Your
first exam is Potions theory. You will work in forty-five minute
blocks and have a ten minute break wherein you will be able to relax
and take any pain medication you may need," the professor
rattled off, as if reciting a carefully written speech. "I will
remain here while you take your exam."</p><p class="calibre9">"And
what will you be doing?" Ginny asked slyly.</p><p class="calibre9">"Catching
up on my child-rearing reading," Lupin replied cheekily, sitting
down on the settee and swinging his legs onto the cushions.
"Seriously, I have my own exams to mark." With a flick of
his wand, Professor Lupin produced a packet of parchment, handing it
to Ginny. "You have a total of two hours for the exam. The first
forty-five minute section will begin…now."</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>"Thank
you, Miss Weasley. I suspect your Defence mark will be rather
spectacular," mused Miranda Gobschalk, the Ministry official who
had helped administer the NEWT exams.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">Ginny
smiled at the elderly witch, relieved that her final exam was now
over with. She was done. It was all over. She silently left the Great
Hall a bit dazed that all it took to complete her years at Hogwarts
was a Shield Charm, a Patronus, and a scamper through an obstacle
course that proved to be no challenge at all.</p><p class="calibre9">A
smile came over her face as she saw Luna waiting for her next to the
stairs, already changed into a more comfortable outfit of track pants
and a garishly pink t-shirt.</p><p class="calibre9">"How'd
you do in the obstacle course?" Luna asked, her face screwed up
in a tight frown. It was obvious Luna didn't do very well. "I'm
afraid I confused the Hinkypunks with Grindylows and blew the poor
things to smithereens. I nearly vomited right there on the spot."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
think I did rather well," Ginny answered. In fact, Ginny did
extremely well on the obstacle course. According to the proctor, she
had the quickest time and no penalties. "You did get your
Patronus to work, didn't you?" That particular charm was always
a trouble spot for the girl. Ginny had Luna practising it nearly
every day in anticipation for the exams.</p><p class="calibre9">Luna
breathed a heavy sigh of relief. "Yes! And it was fully
corporeal, too." Ginny could see the joy in Luna's face over the
appearance of her barn owl Patronus. The heart-shaped face of the owl
reminded Ginny so much of her friend.</p><p class="calibre9">"Wonderful!
Come upstairs with me. I need to get out of this uniform!" Ginny
and Luna traipsed up the stairs to the Fat Lady. "Freedom!"
Ginny shouted.</p><p class="calibre9">"Pardon
me, but is that a Ravenclaw with you, dearie?" the Fat Lady
admonished.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes,"
Ginny replied brusquely, "and it doesn't matter that she's here.
Now let us in! Freedom!" Ginny was reminded of the night of the
Solstice Ball when the Fat Lady was too drunk to let her into the
common room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Sorry,
but the password was changed not ten minutes ago," the Fat Lady
huffed and left her portrait.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
crazy old bint! I should take some paint thinner to you!" Ginny
slid down the wall to wait for someone to open the portal from the
inside. "Damn her!"</p><p class="calibre9">"And
I thought Brutus was difficult," Luna told Ginny. Brutus was the
occupant of the portrait that guarded the entrance to the Ravenclaw
common room. "He is so very particular about pronunciation. One
wrong accent and he becomes as nasty as a Snorkack." Luna joined
Ginny on the floor to wait for entrance.</p><p class="calibre9">It
was only a few minutes' wait before the door opened. Ginny was able
to retrieve the new password, 'Metamorphmagus Mambo', from the sixth
year prefect. Once inside, Ginny turned to Luna and muttered, "Remus
really needs to get a sense of humour, don't you think?" Both
girls giggled at the remark.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The
day before term ended, Ginny, Luna and Colin sat under what they
called 'The Tree of Friendship.' The same tree sheltered Ron, Harry
and Hermione during their days at Hogwarts; Ginny was eventually
added to that circle, as were Neville and Luna in the days following
the battle in the Department of Mysteries. That battle bonded the six
of them in ways no other could understand. It felt appropriate to
spend her last days at Hogwarts there with two of her closest
friends.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">"Ginny?"
Colin asked, looking up into the azure sky. The three of them had
been reminiscing about their years at Hogwarts, laughing at times,
crying at others.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah,
Colin?"</p><p class="calibre9">"I
hope you don't mind my asking, but what really happened to you our
first year? I know you were taken to the Chamber, but no one ever
really said why."</p><p class="calibre9">It
was true. Ginny didn't really talk about that time in her life much,
and would prefer to forget that it ever happened. She didn't blame
Colin for being curious, which was actually not surprising at all.
She often wondered why he didn't ask sooner as she and Colin rarely
kept things from each other.</p><p class="calibre9">"The
Heir of Slytherin was Voldemort. But you knew that." Colin
nodded. "Well, it was really that diary that I had back then
that started it all."</p><p class="calibre9">"I
remember that. You were always writing in it and kept hiding it from
the rest of us," Colin remarked, turning onto his stomach and
chewing on a piece of grass. "But it was just a book, wasn't
it?"</p><p class="calibre9">"No,
it wasn't." Ginny went on to tell the story of how the diary was
a Horcrux and the horrible things it made her do. It felt cathartic
to get the story out, to tell someone who wouldn't judge her or
condemn her for something she had no control over. Colin and Luna
were kind enough not to interrupt her as she spoke, realising she
needed to get it out and for that, Ginny was eternally grateful. She
didn't think that she could stop and start several times as she
relayed the tale to her friends. When she finished, Luna wore the
most loving expression Ginny had ever seen.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
are definitely a Gryffindor. Your bravery that year proved it. I'm
sorry you had to go through that." Luna scooted over to Ginny
and wrapped her arms around her dearest friend.</p><p class="calibre9">"Thank
you." A flood gate opened and Ginny found herself crying for the
little girl who lost her innocence so long ago at the hands of a mad
man.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/>The
day was finally here. In a matter of hours, she would no longer be a
student at Hogwarts. She would be a fully-qualified witch on her way
to embark on a new journey in her life. The prospect both thrilled
and terrified her at the same time. She was thrilled that she would
be one step closer to her dream of being a Healer and living with
Hermione in the flat her friend was leasing. It was found in a mixed
neighbourhood on the outskirts of Diagon Alley. But she was terrified
that she would now have to take care of herself completely for the
first time in her life. Throughout her school years, she insisted
that no one took care of Ginny Weasley. That wasn't entirely true.
She always had her parents' home to return to and her mother's food
to eat and her father's quiet strength. Soon, she would be the one
helping to maintain a home. She would be cooking. She would have to
be strong for herself, because her future depended on what she made
it.<p class="calibre9"/><p class="calibre9">And
then there was Harry.</p><p class="calibre9">They
loved each other deeply, and Ginny knew beyond any doubt that they
were meant to be together. How would they proceed now that she was
out of school? Would they become intimate? Would they live together
at some point? When would they get married? Would they get married?
Even more worrisome was the thought that spending more time together
would make them realise it was all a mistake. This year, they barely
saw each other for more than a week at a time. Could they really
manage being together?</p><p class="calibre9">With
a heavy sigh, Ginny fell back against her pillows and pulled the
covers back over her head, hoping to get a few more minutes sleep.
Unfortunately, it was at that very moment that a shriek erupted
outside her curtains, causing her to jump out of her bed, wand drawn,
ready to do battle.</p><p class="calibre9">"<em class="calibre8">Stupefy</em>!"
Ginny shouted without thinking, the spell making contact with
whomever was in the room. A <em class="calibre8">thunk</em> on the floor told her that
her victim had fallen.</p><p class="calibre9">"Um,
Ginny?" Carrie Newton broke the silence. "Maybe you should
look to see who's on the floor."</p><p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre8">Oh
hell, who did I curse?</em> Ginny's eyes made the journey from
Carrie's face to the floor very slowly. She was filled with a sense
of impending doom as her eyes alighted on the white trainers coming
from scruffy blue jeans that led to an old brown trench coat that
looked oddly familiar. Her heart sunk upon seeing dark brown curls
cascading down the back.</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh,
Hermione! I'm SO sorry! <em class="calibre8">Ennervate!</em>" Ginny watched as
Hermione's eyes fluttered open and darted around the room.</p><p class="calibre9">"Honestly,
Ginny, look before you curse!" Hermione smiled brightly and held
out her hand, which Ginny took, helping her friend off the floor.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
the bloody hell are you doing here? Not that I'm not happy to see you
and all, but still, this isn't like you at all!" Ginny suddenly
stopped, eyeing the young woman before her and pointing her wand at
her. "Are you really Hermione Granger? Prove it!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
it's me!" She took a step, but was halted by the tip of Ginny's
wand in the middle of her chest.</p><p class="calibre9">"What
went wrong with the Polyjuice Potion you took in your second year?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Oh
please, don't make me say it--"</p><p class="calibre9">"Answer
the question."</p><p class="calibre9">"Iturnedintoacat,"
Hermione mumbled. There were several giggles from Enid and Carrie,
who were both standing behind Hermione.</p><p class="calibre9">"Pardon?
I didn't quite hear that," Ginny snapped back, a smile beginning
to play across her lips.</p><p class="calibre9">"Fine,
then. I turned into a cat because I thought it was a strand of
Millicent Bulstrode's hair but it was a cat's instead. I was in the
Hospital Wing for weeks." Hermione began to blush. "Ron
rather liked my tail."</p><p class="calibre9">That
was all it took for Ginny, Enid and Carrie to burst out into fits of
laughter that echoed throughout the large room. Hermione looked
utterly mortified at the other's laughter at her expense, but soon
joined in and then found herself wrapped up in Ginny's arms in the
warm hug she was expecting.</p><p class="calibre9">"So,
what are you doing here?" Ginny pushed Hermione down onto her
bed, feeling more elated than she had in a long time. "Is
everything alright? Is it Harry?"</p><p class="calibre9">"Calm
down. Everyone is fine. Harry's been up since dawn; he's so excited
to see you." Hermione cleared her throat and began again. "I'm
here for work. There are two students that've been hired in the
Department of Mysteries, and I've been sent to take them to the
Ministry."</p><p class="calibre9">"But
how did you get here?" Enid asked, getting impatient and
climbing onto the bed beside the other two.</p><p class="calibre9">Three
pairs of eyes immediately focused on Hermione, eagerly waiting her
explanation. "Well, I developed a new skill recently." Her
face looked sheepish, and Ginny knew she was just bursting to say
what was going on.</p><p class="calibre9">"No!
Get out! You're an Animagus, aren't you?" Ginny had a feeling
that was what Hermione was working on.</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes.
I'm a mouse." Hermione was rather pleased with herself.</p><p class="calibre9">"A
MOUSE! Dear Merlin, Ron's going to FREAK. He had enough problems with
the whole Scabbers-Pettigrew thing, and now you!"</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
Ron's fine with it." Hermione touched her friend's arm, soothing
away her worries. "I Apparated here, and then transformed inside
the gate. I crawled up the vines to get here. McGonagall knew I would
be arriving today and gave me the spell for the gate. Luckily, you
left the window open. I crawled inside and then changed back. You two
saw me!" Hermione turned toward the others, and they nodded
their agreement.</p><p class="calibre9">"You
sure Ron's fine with it? Just don't go showing off around McGonagall.
She may just eat you."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny
looked around the Great Hall for the last time, taking in all that
was around her. The school banners hung from the enchanted ceiling
which was bright with the midday sun, and the colours of the four
Houses draped the windows and walls. Chatter filled the large room
and filled Ginny with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia, remembering
the good and the bad from the past seven years.</p><p class="calibre9">The
clink of a spoon upon a glass quieted the Great Hall, and Professor
McGonagall rose to address the student body.</p><p class="calibre9">"To
all of the students leaving us for the final time this year, I wish
to say 'Well done.' You have been a wonderful example to the
underclassmen, and you should be proud of your accomplishments."
She paused and took a piece of parchment from Professor Flitwick.
"Your NEWT scores will be given to you by your Head of House
shortly. The staff and I are also pleased to inform you that we are
recognising one boy and one girl for achieving the highest marks.
First, we are pleased to honour Mr. Gregory Smythwyck of Ravenclaw."
Applause broke out and Gregory stood, clearly revelling in his
accomplishment. He was Head Boy for good reason. "And I am very
pleased to say that Miss Ginevra Weasley of Gryffindor achieved top
marks as well."</p><p class="calibre9">Ginny's
jaw dropped. This couldn't be happening. She wasn't the brain in the
family. This was wrong.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
stand up!" Colin urged her, poking her in the ribs.</p><p class="calibre9">When
she rose, the applause began and unlike Gregory, she felt embarrassed
and unworthy. Above the sound of the clapping, she heard a squeal of
delight and turned to find Hermione standing just inside the doors,
beaming at her and smiling broadly. Ginny sat down quickly and hoped
to hide from the attention.</p><p class="calibre9">"I
am proud of each of the seventh-year students, and I wish you all the
best in your future paths, wherever they may lead." McGonagall
sat down with a smile, and the chatter of the students grew again.</p><p class="calibre9">Professor
Lupin made his way to the Gryffindor table and took a seat across the
table from Ginny, next to Enid. The remaining seventh-years gathered
round to receive their marks.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ginny,
well done." He reached out his hand, which held her marks, and
Ginny took it with shaking hands. "You really outdid yourself."</p><p class="calibre9">She
opened the envelope and scanned the page, amazed, shocked and proud
all at the same time.</p><hr size="1" width="100%" noshade="" class="calibre10"/><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre8">Care of Magical Creatures—O<br class="calibre6"/>
