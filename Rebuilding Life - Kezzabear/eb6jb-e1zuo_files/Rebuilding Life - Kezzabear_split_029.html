			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">29.
Flight</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Ginny
stood in the hallway for a while after Ron left. Ginny didn't move,
she simply laid her hand over Harry's heart as if feeling its beat,
and lowered her head back down to rest next to it on his chest. Harry
dropped their bags on the floor with a loud thump and circled both
arms around her, his hands splayed across her lower back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said eventually into the stillness.</p><p class="calibre8">"What for?"
asked Ginny, her voice rumbling gently against his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Making bad jokes,
making you worry, just ... I don't know," Harry finished lamely.
Ginny laughed softly and lifted her head off Harry's chest to look
up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry too,"
she said. "I should have put my wand down when you stepped between
us ¾ I was just so mad at Ron. I
thought he was angry at me for being out with you. I worked myself
up all morning. I sent a raving letter to Mum …" Ginny stopped
and thumped her head lightly on Harry's chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"I had no idea
what was going on," murmured Harry. "Every time I tried to find
out something would get in the way! Why would Hermione sit next to
you in Potions? Not only could I not ask you why you were fighting
with Ron, but I had to sit with <em class="calibre9">Malfoy</em>. Now I'm stuck with
him for two months!" Ginny looked up at him apologetically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
she said, biting her bottom lip. "I pulled her to sit with me so I
could rant to her about Ron. I'll swap if you like."</p><p class="calibre8">"No way,"
grimaced Harry. "I won't let you work with <em class="calibre9">Malfoy</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" Ginny
arched one eyebrow and pulled away slightly. Harry didn't falter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really," he
said firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You won't <em class="calibre9">let</em>
me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nope." Harry
shook his head firmly. Ginny eyed him speculatively for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you realise I
don't need your permission?" she asked. Harry just nodded. "And
you're going to forbid me anyway?" Ginny frowned and drew her
eyebrows together. Harry pressed her a little closer and ran a hand
over her hip and down her thigh. He felt her shudder a little and
mould her body into his.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not really
about forbidding," he said quietly as he lowered his mouth over
hers. Ginny did not protest and Harry kissed her leisurely and when
he pulled away her eyes remained closed, her lips still parted and
her face tilted up towards his. "It's about protection."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't need
protecting," Ginny protested weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know." And
because she didn't protest when he pushed her backwards into the
wall as he kissed her, running his hands possessively over her hips
and waist, Harry took that to mean that she would allow his
protection; perhaps just this once.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was just about
to insist they get some lunch before it was over when a loud
caterwauling started up and Peeves swooped along the corridor
cackling loudly and screeching.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Potter
and Weasley are snogging each other's brains out on the third
floor!<br class="calibre6"/>Snog, snog, snog, snog, snoggity, snog-snog!</em></p><p class="calibre8">Blushing, Harry
broke off the kiss and glared at Peeves malevolently as the
poltergeist saluted him and glided through the corridor, still
screeching his little ditty. Ginny giggled nervously and Harry looked
down at her and grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry, I got
carried away," he said, not at all sure he was sorry about getting
carried away, only about getting caught. Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, at least
now we know how my brothers will probably <em class="calibre9">find out</em>," she
said mischievously and ducked under his arm to skip away. Harry
laughed and scooped up their bags once again before following her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think I would
rather at least get the free liquor out of it," he called after her
as they both made their carefree way down to the Great Hall, where
Peeves was hovering in the middle of the room, dancing a jig mid air.
Harry pretended to ignore the sniggers coming from the other students
as he and Ginny seated themselves at the Gryffindor table opposite
Dean and Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly," said
Dean as he selected a ham sandwich. "Everyone knows Peeves haunts
that corridor outside the Hospital Wing looking for public snogging
<em class="calibre9">all the time</em>. What on earth possessed you guys?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, no one told
me," mumbled Harry reaching for his goblet. Dean smirked at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny knows,"
he said and suddenly winced. Harry suspected Ginny had delivered a
well aimed kick under the table and he smiled into his pumpkin juice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
Hermione?" asked Ginny suddenly. Neville looked up from his plate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron was just
here. I think she went to say goodbye," he replied. "She said to
tell you she'd be back for Defence, Harry. I'm not sure why she
wanted me to tell you that though. I mean I could just tell the
Professor if she's not back before we start." Neville shrugged
and continued eating. Harry faltered with a sandwich halfway to his
mouth. He'd utterly forgotten that his classmates, with the
exception of Hermione and Ginny, had no idea that he was to supervise
their Defence class.</p><p class="calibre8">His mouth went dry
and he looked up at the head table to see the teacher with the cat
hat staring at him. The man, catching Harry's eye, narrowed his
eyes at him and turned his mouth up in a smile at the same time.
Anyone who was looking would have thought the man was being pleasant
but Harry could see the expression in his eyes as the man held his
gaze. He couldn't decide if Cat Hat was looking at him with disgust
or loathing but then decided that it amounted to the same thing.</p><p class="calibre8">Feeling rather
off-kilter by the exchange, Harry discarded his half-eaten sandwich
and tried to drink the rest of his pumpkin juice. When it was time
for the first class period after lunch and his Housemates all arose
and gathered their bags, Harry just sat there. He was no longer
disturbed by the strange teacher but overwhelmed by the notion that
he was to supervise his classmates.</p><p class="calibre8">What if they didn't
listen to him? He'd seen what they could get up to. That room could
be deconstructed in minutes. He had only two objectives: to make sure
they turned up and that the classroom remained intact. He suddenly
doubted his ability to accomplish either.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" called
Neville. "Are you coming?" Harry looked up, feeling distinctly
unwell.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um … yeah, just
give me a sec, Neville," he replied. He felt clammy all over. He
took a deep breath and gathered his bag, checking for the scroll of
parchment that contained the class roll. As he stood up he felt a
small, warm hand slip into his and squeeze. Harry squeezed back
reflexively and then looked down at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll be
fine," she whispered and smiled. Harry held onto her hand like a
lifeline as she led the way the way up to the Defence classroom. He
wanted nothing more than to run the other way and the only thing that
kept him moving towards the classroom was Ginny. Her warm, soft
fingers were hooked around his cold, clammy ones ¾
tethering him to her. He followed her blindly until they reached the
doorway of the classroom, still fighting the urge to turn and run. As
Ginny took a step over the threshold, Harry faltered.</p><p class="calibre8">He could see inside
the classroom. In seventh year all four Houses had this class
together and he saw Seamus balancing on the back legs of his chair
while Dean leaned on the desk in front of him, gesturing wildly with
his hands, telling a story Harry couldn't hear. Neville was sitting
next to Luna at a nearby desk, his chin in his hands as he listened
to Dean. Ernie Macmillan, Padma Patil and Justin Finch-Fletchley were
conversing in hushed tones. Anthony Goldstein looked like he was
trying to chat up Susan Bones; who looked decidedly uninterested. A
number of students from Ginny's year were also in the class.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry recognised the
blonde Ravenclaw from Muggle Studies examining her face in a small
mirror and nodding rather absently to her female companion who was
writing on some parchment. This girl suddenly folded the parchment
into a paper plane and spelled it to fly across the room to a rather
large boy who was idly blowing bubbles while he tilted backwards
dangerously on his chair. The paper plane hit the boy on the nose and
he fell flat on his back, groaning. The surrounding students tittered
and giggled before he was helped up by another boy who Harry
recognised as a Gryffindor in Ginny's year. He wondered if this was
the Puddlemere-worshipping git in Ron's bed or the one with the
garishly lettered trunk. Harry was still unaccountably terrified of
the class but he smiled at the carefree nature of the students,
swapping notes, chewing bubble gum and leaning haphazardly on the
furniture. Half the class had been in the DA, most of the rest were
sitting amongst them writing notes or gossiping.</p><p class="calibre8">It was clear they
were all comfortable with one another in spite of their different
Houses and ages; except for the small knot of students sitting at the
back of the classroom under the window. Draco Malfoy was surrounded
by several Slytherin students including Blaise Zabini and a small
stringy boy who looked as though he might be related somehow to
Theodore Nott. Daphne Greengrass was perched uncomfortably on the
edge of a chair while a sleazy-looking, pimply-faced boy leaned over
her, talking intently.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny looked back at
Harry expectantly, still holding his hand. Harry looked at her
helplessly and she just smiled and tugged on his hand. But Harry did
not move; he felt as if he were rooted to the spot, his feet anchored
to the flagstones in the corridor. He shook his head slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't go in
there," he whispered. Ginny's brow furrowed and she studied him
for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're your
friends," she said, stepping back towards him and squeezing his
hand. "They will be thrilled to have you for a teacher."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not a
teacher," growled Harry softly. Ginny shrugged. If she had been
about to say something it was cut off by the sudden arrival of
Hermione who came to a halt behind Harry, breathing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh good, I'm
not late then," she puffed, adjusting her bag on her shoulder. "Ron
was being such a sook about leaving I had to practically shove him
through the gates. Isn't it great we get to see him every
fortnight? Professor McGonagall really is being such a sport. I mean
I could probably live with seeing him just on Hogsmeade weekends but,
between you and me, he just isn't doing so well. I had a hard time
getting him to admit it, but he's a bit lost. I mean he <em class="calibre9">is</em>
right, isn't he? We still have each other and he's all alone.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I can't wait
for next Saturday! I wonder if I can get all my homework done during
the week so I can have Saturday free? Well at least there won't be
any Defence homework will there? Unless you set some of course …
although why I think you'd set any homework in a class you refuse
to actually teach anything in, I don't know! You could at least
make sure we all know how to cast the NEWT spells and we could
practice doing them non-verbally. It'd be a shame to waste the
time, don't you think?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry just listened
to Hermione as she giggled and fluttered her way girlishly through
her monologue. It appeared that the end of the war was slowly
changing everyone. They were a bit more cheerful, a little more
frivolous and just a trifle more carefree than before. Harry peered
into the room again and watched as Seamus leaned over to chat up the
girl who'd blown him off at the train station the night before.
Dean was now sitting with Justin and Ernie and they were smirking at
Seamus. The girl turned her nose up and her back on the Irishman and
the other three boys laughed uproariously. Seamus flipped them the
bird and Neville spared them a glance but was nervously watching Luna
slide a hand up his arm as she spoke absently, staring at the ceiling
and waving her other hand randomly in the air.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?" prodded
Hermione. "Aren't we going in?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What about them?"
Harry hissed, indicating the Slytherins. "You said they were all my
friends. They're not my friends."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who cares?"
answered Ginny. "They're Slytherins. Half of them have Death
Eater parents anyway, they don't matter."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny!"
Hermione whispered disapprovingly. "You're as bad as Ron! Really
Harry, Professor McGonagall put you in charge. You'll be fine."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
what on earth possessed her to do that," muttered Harry as Ginny
tugged on his hand once more and finally pulled him into the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh don't be
silly, Harry," admonished Hermione. "Come on Ginny, we'll go
sit near Luna and Neville." She grabbed Ginny's other hand and
poked Harry in the back and towards the front of the room with the
other. Harry sighed heavily and gathered what little of his courage
had not fled and tried to look confident as he made his way to the
front of the class. He had a feeling his stride probably looked more
like a nervous shuffle. Dropping his bag on the desk at the front of
the room he turned around and leaned on the desk, hoping he looked a
lot more casual than he actually felt. The room gradually fell silent
as his classmates noticed him and began eyeing him speculatively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Isn't that
desk for the <em class="calibre9">teacher</em>, Potter?" Malfoy suddenly drawled. "Or
are you so far up yourself you think none of the rules apply to you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up, Malfoy,"
said Seamus belligerently. "What's goin' on Harry?" Harry
cleared his throat, nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Basically," he
began, "there's no teacher for this class. So … um …
McGonagall has asked me to sort of, supervise. So, uh … don't
blow anything up all right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you mean
there's no teacher?" asked a tall, thin Ravenclaw boy with a
thatch of blond hair that he ruffled as he looked at Harry in
confusion. "There's a teacher, that new bloke with the cat hat."
Harry shifted uncomfortably and figured he'd better tell them all
it was his fault they didn't have a proper Defence teacher.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um … well …
he sort of isn't going to teach seventh year," Harry sighed,
"because of me." The Ravenclaw boy wrinkled his nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because of you?"
he asked. "He isn't teaching us because of you? What'd you do
to him?" There was a burst of scattered laughter and Harry
grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing," he
said rather plaintively. "It's just, well he sort of refused to
teach me and McGonagall couldn't get anyone else because the Board
says the Defence teacher has to be an Auror now and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"We never had an
Auror before," interjected a Hufflepuff from the back row.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah we did,"
replied a girl Harry remembered as one of Ginny's dorm mates. "That
Moody guy – in third year; he was good. Hey why can't we have
him?" Harry sighed heavily and looked out the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because he wasn't
an Auror, he was a Death Eater," he said softly. "And the real
Auror Moody is dead." No one said anything for a long moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"So how come you
didn't just drop Defence?" asked the haughty girl Seamus had been
trying to win over. "Then at least we'd have a proper teacher."
She sat back and folded her arms across her chest and scowled at him,
her resemblance to Umbridge made Harry shudder involuntarily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" Seamus
interjected. "Harry's probably a better teacher than old Cat Hat
anyway!" A chorus of 'yeahs' from Dean, Neville, Ginny and Luna
echoed his sentiment. Harry wondered if Seamus had just blown his
chances with the girl because she sniffed haughtily and looked
pointedly out the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's tied up in
politics," Harry explained. "There are people on the School Board
who insist that the teacher be an Auror. There's not a lot of
Aurors about at the moment and finding a teacher was hard-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's not
like you're an Auror either, Potter," said Blaise Zabini
suddenly. Malfoy made a sound like he was choking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Actually I do
have a position in the Auror department," said Harry uncomfortably.
"Erm … it's a sort of provisional thing." The class studied
him intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cool," said
Dean eventually. The rest of the non Slytherin students echoed his
sentiments by smiling or nodding. It felt like approval. Draco Malfoy
was scowling and his Housemates either followed his lead or, in the
case of Daphne Greengrass and Blaise Zabini, schooled their thoughts
to look carefully neutral.</p><p class="calibre8">"McGonagall and
the Minister felt it best that I continue to take NEWT-level Defence
Against the Dark Arts. However, Professor … um … whatsisname, he
refused to teach me," Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"So we all
suffer," the haughty girl narrowed her eyes at him as if by doing
so she could pin him to the wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"How come you
have to do Defence anyway?" asked Neville suddenly. "I mean it's
not like you aren't already good at it."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's a
bit daft forcing an Auror to sit around at school if there's not
enough of 'em as it is," asserted one of the Hufflepuffs.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's why
Harry has to do Defence then, isn't it?" Dean said decisively.
"They need more Aurors and you can't be an Auror without your
Defence NEWT." The cacophony of voices grew louder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh honestly! Who
expects Harry Potter to have his Defence NEWT?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The Minister
obviously."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's daft."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not really. How'd
you feel if you heard Harry Potter wasn't doing Defence? I mean
he's going to be an Auror, right? He needs a Defence NEWT."</p><p class="calibre8">"But he's not a
teacher."</p><p class="calibre8">"Brilliant, it's
like a free period!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I still don't
see why we have to suffer, how shall we pass our own NEWTS without
proper instruction?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Reckon if we
made it through the war alive we know enough Defence to pass our
NEWT, anyway."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, this'll
be a cinch."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry's
actually a pretty good teacher."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry rubbed his
temples as the students argued back and forth. He hadn't even
marked the roll yet and the haughty Ravenclaw, still glaring daggers
at him, was continually proclaiming rather loudly that she was being
severely disadvantaged in her education.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, maybe
Harry'll teach us something," Dean snarled at her suddenly. The
girl looked taken aback and Seamus shot him a baleful look.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like what?"
asked the small stringy Slytherin suddenly. "My dad reckons all he
knows how to do is <em class="calibre9">Expelliarmus</em>." The boy laughed raucously.
Malfoy, Zabini and Daphne sat silently while the other Slytherins
joined in the laughter. The sleazy-looking, pimply-faced boy took
out his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"I could totally
take him in a duel," he proclaimed loudly. Seamus stood up, tipping
his chair over and pulling out his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh really? You
think so; do you, you little runt?" he asked angrily. "I'd like
to see you try!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You-Know-Who
couldn't even take him in a duel!" called out Ernie Macmillan
suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"There was this
little thing you missed, Salbadar Limuson!" called one of the other
Hufflepuffs from near the front. "Since <em class="calibre9">your House</em> sort of<em class="calibre9">
left</em> instead of staying to fight last year!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah you don't
know anything!" proclaimed Ashton Grant. Limuson raised his wand
and pointed it at Harry, smirking shamelessly. Harry had no desire to
pull a wand on anyone and just stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, come on
then Potter," said the Slytherin boy. "Prove yourself!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Put that down,
you idiot," said Malfoy lazily. "None of you can beat Potter in a
duel … except maybe if his girlfriend and Granger team up." Harry
heard Hermione groan and Seamus snort. He had a very good idea that
Ginny's face was bright red but he kept his eyes on the wand
pointed at his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you beat him
once, didn't you Draco?" demanded Limuson. "In second year?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I hardly think
Potter controlling the snake I sent after him constitutes a defeat,"
said Malfoy quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You always said
you totally beat him, Draco," piped up the stringy boy. He looked
puzzled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well then you
were an idiot for believing me, weren't you?" replied Malfoy
scathingly. "I mean you were there."</p><p class="calibre8">"But you said …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah well, I said
a lot of things," muttered Malfoy, crossing his arms over his chest
and staring at the table. Harry watched him with interest but Dean
suddenly exploded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry beat Malfoy
last time they duelled, you little toe rag!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, you'd
know all about getting beaten by Potter, wouldn't you, Thomas?"
smirked Malfoy, glancing in Ginny's direction rather obviously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was talking
about when we were <em class="calibre9">guests</em> in your home," spat Dean. Harry
took his eyes off Limuson and his wand and looked at Dean and then
Luna. Luna was sitting up a little straighter, extremely pale.
Hermione, sitting behind her, twisted her hands nervously and images
of Ron screaming her name while Bellatrix Lestrange held a knife to
Hermione's throat flashed though Harry's mind. His hands shook
and he gripped the table, glancing at Malfoy.</p><p class="calibre8">Draco Malfoy was
sitting ramrod straight in his chair, his face as pale as his hair.
The rest of the class were looking from Dean, to Harry to Malfoy
questioningly. Malfoy suddenly spoke in a measured, even tone.</p><p class="calibre8">"Potter has beaten
me every time we have duelled," he said. "If you have received
any other impression, you need to listen more carefully." Harry
shook his head mentally at the way Malfoy indicated that others were
fools for believing him. As if it was their fault and not his for
bragging. But Salbadar Limuson hadn't finished. Harry fixed his
attention back on him when he heard the boy snort.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, clearly he
doesn't play fair does he?" Limuson shouted, his wand never
wavering. "I didn't imagine you gloating over his detention for
nearly killing you that day. Snape was pretty clear about how
dangerous Potter is when riled. I mean you were a Prefect and he
slashed you open in cold blood-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Malfoy was about
to <em class="calibre9">Crucio</em> him!" shouted Ginny suddenly, her eyes blazing.
"Probably your favourite spell, isn't it, you slimy little piece
of pond scum!" Limuson turned his wand on Ginny and shouted a spell
Harry didn't even hear. He had his wand out and bellowed <em class="calibre9">Protego</em>
before Limuson's spell had even left the tip of his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">Limuson was clearly
enraged that his spell had been thwarted and turned his wand on
Harry. As he ducked a purple spell, Harry had a grim realisation. The
Slytherin knew that by threatening Ginny Weasley he would get exactly
what he wanted – a duel with Harry Potter.</p><p class="calibre8">Unable to get a
clear shot at Limuson through the desks, chairs and other students
Harry dodged a streak of silver light that went sailing into a group
of Hufflepuffs who scattered, squawking indignantly. Immediately
Neville cast a Shield Charm around his classmates and Harry dived
behind a chair as a streak of red light sailed past his left ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sit down, you
idiot!" bellowed Malfoy suddenly. Limuson turned to give him a
contemptuous look and Harry took his chance. Scrambling up onto the
teacher's desk to get a height advantage, Harry aimed his wand over
the heads of the other Slytherins.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Expelliarmus</em>!"
he cried and then thinking quickly followed it by a nonverbal
<em class="calibre9">Levicorpus</em>. Salbadar Limuson was soon wandless and hanging by
one ankle, high above the rest of the class, the blood rushing slowly
to his head and turning his face a lovely shade of puce. With his
wand still trained on Limuson, Harry hopped lightly off the desk and
bent to pick up the discarded wand. He walked slowly over to Malfoy
and handed him the other boy's wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Useful little
spell, <em class="calibre9">Expelliarmus</em>," he said nonchalantly as he levitated
Limuson closer to Malfoy and the ground. "It leaves you just a
little bit helpless." Then Harry flicked his wand to dump Limuson
unceremoniously on the floor before stalking back to the teacher's
desk.</p><p class="calibre8">An uneasy silence
settled over the classroom. Limuson staggered to his feet and
snatched his wand from Malfoy before throwing himself into a seat as
far away from Harry as he could get. Harry, who was still shaking
from the encounter, hid his hands by searching in his bag for a
quill. He unrolled the scroll containing the class list and spread it
on the table, still trying to regain his equilibrium.</p><p class="calibre8">"Attendance is an
integral part of obtaining a NEWT," he explained quietly.
"McGonagall has asked me to mark the roll. After that we are free
to occupy our own time without destroying the classroom." He began
to read out the list of names.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?"
questioned Neville hesitantly when Harry got to him. He looked up at
Neville expectantly and nodded to him to go on but Neville glanced at
Hermione nervously and fell silent. Dean and Seamus were glaring
belligerently at Malfoy and the carefree attitude had fled the
classroom. A thick, nervous cloud hung over the students, who were
fiddling with quills or parchment. Feet shuffled softly and Harry
could hear at least one person tapping nervously on a desk in the
oppressive stillness. Harry finished marking the roll and started
rolling it carefully and deliberately because he knew as soon as he
finished that he would have nothing else to do with his hands. He was
tying the tartan ribbon back around it with a great deal more care
than he would usually exert when the oppressive silence was finally
broken.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you think you
could show us that non verbal stuff again?" asked Ernie Macmillan
suddenly. "It's just, well; you were pretty good at teaching us
back in the DA and …"</p><p class="calibre8">"It would be very
helpful," Blaise Zabini added quietly as Ernie trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not very
good at nonverbal spells," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"You did one just
then!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah well, that
was a bit of a fluke," Harry said desperately, scratching the back
of his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Rubbish,"
proclaimed Seamus. "I've seen you do that before!"</p><p class="calibre8">"C'mon Harry,"
pleaded Justin Finch-Fletchley. Susan Bones was looking at Harry as
though she could convince him with her eyes and the rest of Ginny's
year just looked up at him expectantly. It was as if they thought he
could teach them to fly without a broomstick. He let out a loud sigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right, well,
its concentration really," he began. "It's mostly just
practice, so start with the spells you are really good at."</p><p class="calibre8">The lesson period
was spent productively after all, although Daphne Greengrass and
Blaise Zabini were the only Slytherins to participate. Hermione had
actually managed to levitate a feather wordlessly but Seamus only set
fire to it and that sent Dean into a round of helpless laughter that
Neville, Harry and Hermione joined in.</p><p class="calibre8">"Win-<em class="calibre9">gar</em>-dium
Levi-<em class="calibre9">o</em>-sa," muttered Seamus in a perfect imitation of Ron as
he cleaned up the ashes. The lesson finished and the older
Gryffindors were still laughing helplessly. Ginny looked at them
bemused.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm almost
scared to ask why you are all laughing so hard," she said, picking
her bag up off the floor. Seamus grinned at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Once upon a time,
oh fair lassie, there were a wee young prince called Ronald," he
winked at her. "And he pined for a fair princess who corrected him
all the time. The court jester tried to impress her with his prowess
but all he did was set fire to his feather."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, right,"
said Ginny smirking. "So who eventually won the heart of the
princess?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The prince did,"
said Hermione dreamily. "Because even though he thought she was
mental he still saved her from the troll using the very spell with
which she had tortured him. He's actually a very smart prince and
the jester is apparently still turning feathers into ashes."</p><p class="calibre8">"He hopes to win a
girl soon though," said Seamus. "There she goes!" Seamus took
off after the girl he had been pursuing since the night before.</p><p class="calibre8">"He is never going
to win her over," said Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh he will,"
Dean assured him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I cannot see
Audrey Harrison-Smythe willingly going out with Seamus Finnegan,"
laughed Ginny. "The only person more fond of rules is Percy!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I bet you a
galleon he has won her over by the end of September," said Dean.
Ginny regarded him carefully for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Deal," she
said, holding out her hand and they shook on it before heading out of
the Defence classroom. Harry caught up to her at the last row of
desks and slid an arm around her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey there
Professor Potter," said Ginny, looking up at him. Harry grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"That just sounds
stupid," he said and Ginny laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"It wasn't so
bad was it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, not at all,
not once I subdued a random Slytherin," Harry snorted. "I mean I
could have let him hex me, but I've already tried that today."
Ginny blushed and Hermione turned in the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I think it
went very well, Harry. I think we could get quite a lot done this
year," she said earnestly. Harry just nodded at her enthusiasm as
she began to list all the things they should make a note of to
practice. Harry tuned her out a little and was trying to figure out a
way to get past her when he heard a series of short, sharp footsteps.
Their owner had a gargantuan shadow that looked like it moved of its
own accord. As the tall, thin man with the Cat Hat came around the
corner his shadow loomed seemingly large, at odds with his actual
profile.</p><p class="calibre8">He wore voluminous
robes of a deep green that seemed to shimmer as he moved and a pair
of dragon-hide boots with shiny tips. His cat was curled around his
head. Up close it looked quite ludicrous and Harry unsuccessfully
fought the urge to laugh. He managed to contain it as a sort of half
snort; half cough and stepped into the corridor. Professor Fiesche
looked at him with barely concealed disgust.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you <em class="calibre9">quite</em>
finished with my classroom?" he asked. Harry just nodded and had to
jump quickly out of the way as the professor swept imperiously into
his classroom and shut the door with a snap.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought
McGonagall said he was intimidated by you?" asked Ginny as they
stared at the closed door. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm beginning
to think she was mistaken or he was pretending," he answered.</p><p class="calibre8">"He doesn't seem
to like you much at all," said Hermione as they headed to the
Gryffindor common room.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's the
Defence professor," said Harry. "I think it's in their
contract."</p><p class="calibre8">********************</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione, Ginny and
Harry were studying in the Gryffindor common room when the rest of
the house trooped in after the final lesson period of the day.
Strictly speaking, Hermione was studying and Harry and Ginny were
playing footsies under the table and with quills on top of it.
Hermione was either too absorbed to notice or too busy to care
because she didn't admonish them for it. Harry had written two
sentences of his Herbology report and Ginny had done even less of her
Muggle Studies quiz.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey, Hermione,"
asked Ginny suddenly. "How do you turn on an ekeltrick light?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know how to do
that!" protested Harry indignantly. "Why are you asking her?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh! I forgot!"
Ginny said. "I'll find you a question; I already know the answer
to the football ones. Dean's got a one track mind …" Harry
frowned and scribbled another line in his Herbology homework.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
you are supposed to get other people to answer the questions for you,
Ginny," said Hermione disapprovingly. Ginny's retort was cut off
by a loud argument coming from the portrait hole.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't say
that!" screamed Gilbert Chumley. He was red in the face and his
fists were clenched as he glared at his brother.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know it's
true as well as I do," answered Gerald calmly. Gilbert went white.</p><p class="calibre8">"No! No it isn't!
Don't say it," he whispered before turning and dashing up the
dormitory stairs, tears flowing down his cheeks.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!" called
Seamus. "What'd you say to the kid?" Dexter and Hamish hurried
up the stairs after Gilbert while Othello shook his head slowly at
Gerald.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's
time he faced the facts," said Gerald sullenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"But you don't
know the facts do you?" asked Othello quietly. "Gilbert told us
what happened in Transfiguration. Just because your dad went to work
and never came home doesn't mean he's dead."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh and really,
where else would he be then?" asked Gerald scathingly. "It's
been a year! Why wouldn't he come home all this time? The war's
been over for months and he <em class="calibre9">hasn't come home</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"He's probably
still in hiding," said Othello desperately, Gerald looked to be on
the verge of hysteria.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well why didn't
he take us with him?" he said brokenly. "Why didn't he just
come home first?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe he
couldn't, mate," said Dean quietly. "People who went on the run
last year … had to just duck out pretty quick mostly. Not everyone
was able to send word to their families either."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well he's
probably dead now anyway," said Gerald harshly, as if breaking down
would ruin his image. "Can't imagine hiding would be easy; bound
to get caught in the end aren't you? I read that Anne Frank story
when I was still in primary school."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not everyone who
went on the run got caught and … killed," said Dean, glancing at
Harry and Hermione. Harry looked at Hermione out the corner of his
eye. She was deathly pale as she stared at Gerald and bit her lip.
Gerald glared at Dean.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh and you'd be
the expert at it," he said sarcastically. "Spent a good bit of
time on the run then, have you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"As a matter of
fact I spent most of last year on the run," said Dean quietly,
"until I got caught."</p><p class="calibre8">"Better than being
stuck in some ancient house full of decrepit wizards and stuck up
Muggles," muttered Gerald. "At least you were free to roam about
the place instead of listening to some fat, Muggle dunderhead argue
with his parents the entire time. If I never see Dudley again it will
be too soon." Harry's mouth went dry. He was about to ask Gerald
more about his year in hiding when Dean exploded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I spent weeks on
the streets of London after the Death Eaters nearly caught me in
Diagon Alley!" he bellowed. "I didn't have time to tell my mum
or my sisters anything. I had no idea if they were even all right.
Sure, I was free to <em class="calibre9">roam</em>. You may not have realised but
England isn't the warmest of places, even in summer. Hiding among
homeless Muggles isn't exactly a good way to keep warm unless you
want them a little too close!</p><p class="calibre8">"I cast some
bluebell flames in desperation one night, halfway through autumn, and
they found me quicker than you can say Jack Robinson. I Apparated
wildly; nearly Splinched myself, it was not pleasant. Then I spent
the next few months living in forests and fields with a couple
old-timers and some ancient goblins. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO
CATCH FISH WHEN THE RIVERS AND LAKES ARE FROZEN OVER?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dean, go easy -"
began Seamus, but he was cut off. Dean turned on him rapidly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you even
start!" he said. "This little upstart spent his time in some <em class="calibre9">safe
house – </em>andyou! You were here! All right for the
purebloods and the half bloods isn't it? Nice and safe at school;
Warm beds, food on the table; it's all right for some. What have
you got if you're Muggle-born? A price on your head, that's
what!" Neville held out a hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dean-"</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't even
know, Neville!" Dean cut him off. "You don't know what it's
like; isolated, fighting for your life when you don't know where
your enemy is or even who it is. And you can't use magic in case
they can find you. I spent months camping on frozen ground and hiding
in Muggle barns, just waiting; hoping and waiting for something good
to happen. And this little … the little <em class="calibre9">smart aleck</em> has the
<em class="calibre9">gall</em> to question if I know what it is like to be forced into
hiding!"</p><p class="calibre8">"It wasn't all
that safe here," Seamus shot back.</p><p class="calibre8">"But you knew what
was going on," said Dean. He was running out of steam. "No
relying on some dodgy old bloke on the run from the Ministry to tell
you if your friends are okay. Then wondering just how badly they got
punished. And your mum knew where you were. You didn't have to run
away without even telling her where you'd gone; if you were okay."</p><p class="calibre8">"People went
missing from Hogwarts too," said Neville quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Being here was
like being isolated too," said Ginny quietly. "It's no easier
being the person who didn't get to say goodbye." Harry felt his
heart clench.</p><p class="calibre8">"But <em class="calibre9">he</em>
can't stand there and tell me that he had it so much worse," said
Dean, stabbing a finger in Gerald's direction before turning to
stare out the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't <em class="calibre9">choose</em>
to live locked up in a house for months on end," said Gerald. "I
didn't <em class="calibre9">choose</em> to be stuck in a house with a fat pig who
brainwashed my brother! I didn't choose never to be allowed outside
and to try and keep my mother from drowning in her own grief... He
never came home. He never sent word."</p><p class="calibre8">"The fact you were
sent to a safe house means your dad got word to someone," Seamus
said quietly. "Almost no one went to safe houses after the
Muggle-born breakout at the Ministry. Me mam said going into hiding
was more dangerous than staying in your house with wards cast."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's been
exactly a year since Dad went to work and never came home," said
Gerald. "And Gilbert didn't even remember it was today. He still
thinks dad's alive."</p><p class="calibre8">"He might be,"
said Harry. He distantly heard his own voice, sounding calmer than he
felt. His heart was hammering in his chest and his hands were clammy.
He looked at Hermione. Her eyes were wide and her hand shook as it
covered her mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"How would you
know?" asked Gerald harshly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because I told
them to go," whispered Harry. "I told them to go, get out; go
overseas."The faces of the scared Muggle-borns in the Ministry swam
before him. He almost didn't hear Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you mean
you told them?" he asked. "Who did you tell? What did you tell
them?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Muggle-borns," Harry said agitatedly, "in the Ministry on
September second last year. I told them to hide overseas if they had
to."</p><p class="calibre8">"Then it's your
fault," said Gerald accusingly. "Mr Dursley was right. You are a
troublemaker."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry stood
abruptly. Images of that day at the Ministry ran through his mind.
The frightened faces tumbled through his head, mingling with Dean's
face the night they were snatched and taken to Malfoy Manor. He could
see Luna's protuberant eyes, glowing in the dark cellar;
Aberforth's twinkling blue eye staring at him, so like
Dumbledore's; Dobby's green tennis ball eyes glowing in the dim
light of the cellar. He could hear Ron screaming Hermione's name
and Mary Cattermole crying for her children.</p><p class="calibre8">He left his
belongings on the table and stumbled to the portrait hole, desperate
to escape the images and sounds that only he could see and hear. He
spilled out into the seventh floor corridor and started running,
trying to get away. He didn't know where he was going and he didn't
really care but he found himself staring at the blackened wall
opposite the tapestry where Barnabas the Barmy was teaching ballet.
Thinking feverishly he paced back in front of the wall, willing the
Room of Requirement to appear to give him somewhere to think.</p><p class="calibre8">The blackened wall
remained unmoving and impossibly impenetrable. Harry kicked it in
frustration and sank to the floor, cradling his head in his hands.
The tender spot on the back of his skull was throbbing and it felt
almost as if his head was about to explode. Gilbert and Gerald's
father had been at the Ministry that day and never come home. Gerald,
Gilbert and their mother had gone into hiding with Dedulus Diggle and
stayed with his aunt, uncle and cousin in a safe house.</p><p class="calibre8">The cheerful,
carefree façade of Hogwarts was cracking. There were too many
stories, too many traumas and no one could keep the front up for
long. It took only a word, a phrase to chip away at carefully
constructed walls and barriers to expose deep wounds. With each word
about his year on the run Dean had hammered another wedge into
Harry's own self control. He had wanted to shout at them all that
if it was a contest about who had it worst, then he had them all
beat. He wanted to tell them he'd spent the year on the run, hiding
and eating fungus because the biggest price was on his head.</p><p class="calibre8">He wanted to yell
that he'd lost more parents than any of them and he'd had to run
without saying goodbye, too. But he didn't. He just ran. A part of
him whispered that it wasn't his problem anymore and he could just
keep running, but Harry knew that wasn't true. He'd been wrapped
up in this war since before he was born and now he was such an
integral part of it that he couldn't extricate himself. It wasn't
over yet. He had to find out what happened to all those people at the
Ministry that day. He couldn't ignore the Dursley's any longer.</p><p class="calibre8">But Harry Potter was
having a very bad day and instead of turning around and facing his
responsibilities, he kept them at bay for a little while longer.
Harry Potter turned and ran.</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry traced the
lines on the Astronomy Tower with his index finger. They curved and
weaved across the inside face of the tower. The fresh mortar and the
patched cracks made a random pattern of welts and scars across the
wall. He sat with his back in the corner, his robes pulled tightly
around his shoulders to ward against the cold seeping in from the
window above. The line he was tracing ended abruptly in a mess of
stone-coloured mortar near the floor and he stretched his fingers out
to splay them across the cool flagstones.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had been
examining the repairs to the Astronomy Tower for the past two hours.
If you walked around Hogwarts you didn't see the cracks unless you
looked closely. There were more lines and patches on this piece of
wall than he'd ever thought possible. The Astronomy Tower itself
was unnaturally clean. There was no dust on the freshly finished
windowsills and no fingerprints marred the gleaming surfaces of the
telescopes in the corner. They were new, just like the tables in the
Great Hall and the panes of glass in the Greenhouses. The flagstones
looked scrubbed and there were patches on the walls and floor that
were cleaner than the rest.</p><p class="calibre8">As he trailed his
fingers along a gouge in the floor Harry wondered who had fought up
here. There was a new tapestry hanging on one wall and Harry thought
he could see splashes of blood on the floor underneath it. He
couldn't bear to look under the tapestry to see what it was hiding
on the wall underneath. Someone's blood had been spilled here, they
may have even died and the thought made him shiver. He hadn't
remembered that the Astronomy Tower had been damaged but the evidence
was all around him. There were no unclaimed cloaks hanging on the
pegs by the door; no abandoned quills or half empty inkpots on the
shelves where bags were stored. It should have smelt like parchment
and ink, mouldy socks and sweat, from generations of students who
came up here to study or to … relax. Instead it smelt like brass
polish and varnish.</p><p class="calibre8">Hogwarts was just
like the students: it looked fine. The wood gleamed, the brass work
was shiny and no dust rose in little puffs from the carpets when you
walked. The tapestries were hung with care and the stonework was
clean. But if you looked a little closer you could see that the walls
had cracks, that the fixtures were new and untested and that some
things were simply covered up. Harry thought if he started chipping
away at the patch under his hands that the old Tower might start
crumbling away. It was too new and too fresh to hold if he put it
under any pressure and it wasn't hard enough to resist the
scratches that he couldn't help putting in it.</p><p class="calibre8">When the first drop
of blood from his torn and bleeding fingertips fell onto the new
mortar and sank into the porous stone he stopped his scratching
suddenly and stared at his fingers, uncomprehending. He watched the
blood beading and slowly dripping into his palm before hesitantly
wrapping his hand in the hem of his robes and leaning his head back
against the wall. He closed his eyes and let his mind wander.</p><p class="calibre8">He was surprised to
find himself still alone. He thought someone would have come looking
for him a long time ago. Maybe they had, he mused, they'd just not
found him yet. He didn't know why he'd come here, he was just
running and this was as far as he could go. He knew he had to go back
but he didn't know if he was done thinking yet. The problem was he
couldn't remember what he'd been thinking anymore. He knew he
needed to write a letter to Dudley. Perhaps he was just putting it
off by hiding up here. He'd have to go soon, it was almost tea time
and he was getting hungry. He checked his watch and sighed. Deciding
to go down to the Great Hall, he hoisted himself to his feet. The
blood had dried on his hand and he cast a Cleansing Charm before
opening the door. He stopped abruptly when he nearly ran into Draco
Malfoy on the other side.</p><p class="calibre8">"Alone, Potter?"
he asked, smirking. Harry gave him a withering look, as he stepped
over the threshold and onto the landing.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't see
your company, Malfoy," he said as the other man ignored him and
pushed past into the Tower room.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
doing here?" he asked, sounding suspicious. Harry saw no reason to
evade the truth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thinking," he
shrugged. "There's a lot to think about these days."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," said
Malfoy quietly. He turned to stare out of the window and Harry almost
felt compelled to stay and ask him what was wrong. He may have done
it too, if there had not been a sudden thundering of footsteps on the
stone steps below.</p><p class="calibre8">"HARRY!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't a man get
peace and quiet around here?" complained Malfoy at the sound of
Ron's voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"I had a couple
hours of it," smirked Harry. Malfoy just turned his back on him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's Weasley
still doing here anyway?" he asked pointedly. Harry groaned. He had
not even registered that Ron shouldn't <em class="calibre9">be </em>there.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron?" he called
down the stairwell.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up, Potter,"
said Malfoy, sounding rather irritated. Harry ignored him and took a
step towards the stairs when Ron came around the corner of the spiral
staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry! Where have
you been?" he panted, gripping Harry by the arms tightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been up
here," Harry replied, "thinking." Ron let him go and slumped
against the wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"The whole time?"
he asked. Harry nodded. Ron pushed himself off the wall and grabbed
Harry's arm again, pulling him down the stairwell. "Merlin, can
you teach those girls to use the ruddy map?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
doing here, Ron?" asked Harry as he stumbled down the steps after
his best friend.</p><p class="calibre8">"Looking for you,"
retorted Ron. "Hermione Floos me in tears again – I mean what is
going on with all the crying? As far as I can tell, you had a fight
with a Slytherin and Dean loses his marbles and then you run off -
and all after lunch! Is that about right?" Harry pulled his arm out
of Ron's grasp.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, about
right," he agreed. "Still don't see what you're doing here."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione called
me," said Ron, "in a right state. Not sure where you were, Dean
gone off his rocker and some midget called Galbraith or something
having a crisis."</p><p class="calibre8">"So she
Fire-called you to talk?" asked Harry. Ron stopped abruptly and he
groaned as comprehension flooded over his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"She just called
me to talk, didn't she?" he asked. Harry nodded. "And I rushed
over, didn't I?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Apparently so,"
reflected Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"McGonagall is
going to kill me," said Ron morosely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not today, Mr
Weasley," McGonagall's firm voice came from behind them. "I
suggest however, that you return immediately to the place from whence
you came and stay there until a week from Saturday." By the time
Harry and Ron turned around the Headmistress was gone. They could
hear her swishing around the corner.</p><p class="calibre8">"Creepy,"
commented Ron. "She can do that disappearing thing just like
Dumbledore." They headed straight for the Gryffindor common room
and had an argument with the Fat Lady about whether Ron could go in.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's not
exactly a resident, is he?" she sniffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am and I said
the blasted password," said Harry in exasperation. "Harry Potter,
Harry Potter, <em class="calibre9">Harry Potter</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"How do I know
he's not up to no good?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Has the war
addled your brains, woman?" asked Ron. Harry groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron!" he
hissed, but it was too late. The Fat Lady turned her back on them and
walked out of her frame.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi! What sort of
guardian do you call yourself then?" Ron called after her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up, Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">They waited only
moments before the portrait hole opened and Dean spilled out in the
corridor, Seamus on his heels.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, I want to!"
Dean was saying angrily. "Let me just take the scrawny little git
and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said
Seamus firmly. "I know he's being a git but the kid lost his dad.
Give him a break."</p><p class="calibre8">"He's not the
only one, is he?" argued Dean. "Little tosser thinks he's more
hard done by than anyone else!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you're not
the worst off either!" Seamus retorted. "What about Harry! He
lost both his parents years ago, had You-Know-Who after him for years
and went on the run before you did! Show a little tact and
sensitivity, man!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, some tact
…" said Ron. Seamus and Dean jumped and turned to face them.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … er … well
… oh bollocks," said Seamus turning a fetching shade of red.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry, Harry,"
said Dean quietly. "You all right? You've been gone a while."
Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah I've been
thinking," he said. Dean nodded silently. No one spoke. Seamus
shuffled his feet nervously and Harry leaned against the wall his
hands in his pockets.</p><p class="calibre8">"You reckon she'll
come back?" asked Ron eventually, gesturing at the empty portrait.
Seamus shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Doesn't matter,
time to go down and eat anyway," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"For you maybe,"
grumbled Ron. "McGonagall will have kittens if I turn up in the
Great Hall. I wanna say good bye to Hermione before I go though."</p><p class="calibre8">"She's talking
to that Chumley kid," said Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"The git?" asked
Ron with a scowl on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah, the little
one," Seamus replied. "He came back down after you ran out of the
common room and practically launched himself at his brother,
something about how he'd know if their dad was dead."</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville had to
separate them," added Dean. "He hauled Gerald off and left
Gilbert to Hermione."</p><p class="calibre8">"What's going on
with them?" asked Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Remember how
their mum said her husband never came home from the Ministry one
day?" Harry said. Ron nodded. "It was the day we were there."
Ron straightened up abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What happened to
all those Muggle-borns?" asked Ron quietly. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, we've
gotta find out," said Ron urgently. Harry nodded. Seamus and Dean
looked at the two of them questioningly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why would you go
into the Ministry, Harry?" asked Seamus. "They were looking for
you. They had Ministry officials swarming all over Platform nine and
three quarters the day we left for school. Dunno why they thought
you'd turn up to go to school with a price on your head."</p><p class="calibre8">"I was Undesirable
Number One by then," muttered Harry as he leant against the wall
next to the Fat Lady's portrait.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what was so
important that you went to the Ministry?" Dean asked curiously.
"And how'd you possibly get in and out without getting caught?"
Harry glanced at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"We nearly did,"
said Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Polyjuice
Potion," said Harry. He was about to say more when the portrait
swung open again and Neville clambered out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh there you are,
Harry," he said when he spotted the other man. "Ginny's
mumbling something about castration under her breath in there."
Harry grimaced and reached over to shut the portrait hole with a
click.</p><p class="calibre8">"Damn shame the
Fat Lady's gone and I'm stuck out here then, isn't it?" he
muttered. Ron snorted loudly and Dean let out a bark of laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what was so
important you had to go to the Ministry a year ago?" continued
Seamus. "Not exactly safe was it?" Harry glanced at Ron who
nodded slightly and at his best mate's agreement Harry told them
about disguising themselves to go in and find the Horcrux, Umbridge
presiding over the Muggle-born Commission and the way in which they'd
been uncovered and almost caught.</p><p class="calibre8">"So we only just
barely got away," finished Ron after Harry stopped speaking. "I'm
still missing a chunk of my arm. Not the last time I got Splinched."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mr Chumley was
there that day; it was the day he never came home," Harry added.
"He might still be alive, a lot of people got away that day. Who
knows where he went."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well then we have
to find him," said Ron, "and bring him home. Those boys need
him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why us?"
shrugged Dean. Seamus looked at Ron questioningly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy says the
Ministry's got their hands full with trials, fixing up the prison,
keeping people like Malfoy in line," said Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's Malfoy
doing?" asked Harry sharply.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing yet,"
replied Ron, "but you wouldn't want him to start would you?
There's no time or manpower to track down missing persons."</p><p class="calibre8">"Those boys are
Gryffindors," said Neville quietly. "We look after them and no
one should be without a parent." Harry looked at Neville; the
round-faced, chubby boy had vanished a long time ago. This man was
someone new, someone with drive and determination.</p><p class="calibre8">"War orphans …"
murmured Harry. He saw Dean and Seamus shift uncomfortably. Ron
examined his feet carefully. "It's not just Gryffindors. I bet
there are kids in the other Houses with missing parents too."
Neville nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"No one deserves
that if it can be helped," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"So that's why
us," said Harry. "Why not us? You don't have to lose your
parents or your family to know how important it is to find these
people and bring them home. They've got to be out there, some of
them had to have gotten away."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll talk to
Percy," said Ron. "He must have some sort of idea about where
people went while they were in hiding." Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll find out
who we are looking for, too," said Seamus. "Can't find 'em
unless we know who they are."</p><p class="calibre8">"How're we going
to do anything stuck at school?" asked Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I never let
that stop me before," said Harry resolutely, pushing away from the
wall. "I'm going to find their dad and bring him home, one way or
another. They're hurting; they need him … or closure. Right now …
I need a way to get back into this common room. I think I might have
some explaining to do."</p>
