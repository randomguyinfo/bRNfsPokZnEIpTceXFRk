<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_21">*Chapter 20*: Chapter 20</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">20.
Some Day I'll Wish Upon a Star</strong></p><p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: Well hello
again! Thanks for all the contact I have had about this story.
Sometimes I remember to reply to reviews and sometimes it takes me a
while to get back to you but I do read every single one of them! A
few notes about this chapter - the star stuff is all true, I borrowed
the bus stuff from St Margarets' NZ Chronicles and Harry and his
family and friends from JKR. Bert and Ernie belong to me, along with
Jonathon.</strong></p><p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
kill'em!" exploded Ernie. Jonathon rolled his eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
a Pukwdgie?" asked Harry tentatively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nasty
little thieving buggers, I'm gunna hunt 'em down and I'm gunna
kill'em!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Calm
down Ernie, it's not that bad," said Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
can't just kill something!" exclaimed Hermione, sounding utterly
scandalised.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your
mum don't let you point the bone anyway," muttered Bert before
she poked her head into the compartment. "Well, looks like they
stole the thought box."</p><p class="calibre8">"O'
course they stole the thought box <em class="calibre9">Alberta</em>,"
said Ernie. "Ya could see that soon as I opened it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me that," she said absently as she crawled under the bus, her
bottom sticking out from under the front wheel arch.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thought
box?" said George as he poked his head into the compartment where
Bert had been moments before. His voice was muffled as he continued.
"What's a thought box?" George emerged from the compartment
looking no wiser than he had before he'd taken a look at the
magical-mechanical compartment. Harry wondered what Bert was looking
for, her lower half twisting as she wriggled about under the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Helps
with driving the bus, bit like Apparating the whole thing," said
Jonathon absently staring at what little could be seen of Bert.
"Ernie thinks and the thought box collects his thoughts and the
Roobus goes, simple really."</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
staring at 'er ar-" began Ernie but Jonathon elbowed him in the
ribs before he finished. Bert's voice rose up from under the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
chewed through the chassis all right, got themselves into the
compartment and stole the thought box from underneath," she called
and Ernie growled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ya
right grumpy out here aren't you? Stop being such a bloody drongo,
Ern," she said exasperatedly as she emerged from under the bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"What're
we gunna do about it?" Ernie scratched his head, staring at the
compartment where the thought box had obviously been.</p><p class="calibre8">It
seemed everyone else had the same idea as they swivelled as one to
look at Jonathon. It was obvious that Jonathon was the one with
ideas, that he took the leadership role just as it was clear Bert
liked action and Ernie was the thinker in their friendship. He posed
the questions; waiting for solutions he knew would come.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
we're stuck in the middle of nowhere without a thought box,"
Jonathon started. "What's close? Mutijulu township or the resort
at Yulara?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We
haven't got a permit for Mutijulu and it's peak tourist season,
Yulara's full up," said Bert as she pulled her wand out and
advanced on the compartment, still gaping open on the side of the
bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bonza,"
said Jonathon dryly. "We're stranded in winter in the desert and
nowhere to stay with a bus full of Poms who aren't licensed to
Apparate!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Um,
excuse me," said Hermione hesitantly. "Are we going to be stuck
here long?" Jonathon raked his hand through his hair but said
nothing while Hermione waited for his response.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
forget Arkie," said Bert absently, poking the strands of magic in
the exposed compartment with her wand. One of the yellow strands
arced and snapped at her hand and she dropped her wand inside,
yelping. Jonathon grabbed her hand immediately and swore at the welt
growing there.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
better Apparate to Ernie's mum and get her to fix you up," he
said decisively as he levitated her wand out of the compartment and
handed it back to her. "She'll have a cocky about won't she?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
she's got one to send letters to me and Uncle Mick. I'll go send
it to Adelaide for a new thought box," sighed Ernie. "I'll get
mum to put Arkie up, she won't mind. And I'll bring back some
food."</p><p class="calibre8">"Good,
I don't fancy huntin' thanks," said Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">"Plenty
lizards out here yer great wuss," mumbled Ernie. Jonathon turned to
Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,
Hermione," he said. "It looks like we are stuck here for the
night." He turned to Bert and Ernie. "Ernie, you reckon your mum
can send along some swags and that?" Ernie nodded briefly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
can't we just Apparate to somewhere with beds?" asked George.
Harry thought he had an excellent point.</p><p class="calibre8">"Even
if you were licensed to Apparate here there's nothing close,"
explained Jonathon. "The risk of Splinching or landing even further
into the desert just isn't worth Apparating to a place over three
hundred k's away. Accomplished wizards can do it but I wouldn't
try it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Three
hundred k's? How far is that?" asked Ron, sounding quite
irritated.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
quite two hundred miles," said Hermione quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gets
harder the further you go," continued Jonathon, "and there's a
lot of places out here to get lost in. I'm not a fan of getting
Splinched." Ron grunted, a scowl on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Picked
up more than one idiot in an emergency who thought he'd save
himself a bus trip and wound up with half an arm missing 'cause he
got too disoriented in the sand dunes and forgot his three Ds,"
added Bert.</p><p class="calibre8">"Without
the Roobus working there's nothing to rescue us if we manage to get
in the same predicament," finished Jonathon.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
subsided and Harry suspected he had little desire to be Splinched
again. Harry had absolutely no desire to be Splinched, or to risk
Splinching Ginny who would have to rely on him to Apparate her. He
rather thought that Apparition training had not been high on the
Death Eater agenda for learning at Hogwarts last year. Ginny had
certainly not indicated that she had the ability to Apparate. She was
currently looking at Jonathon as he continued to explain the problems
with Apparition.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
red tape to sort out even emergency unlicensed Apparation would have
you detained for more than a week," he was saying apologetically.
Harry rather thought that was excessive but it seemed normal to
Jonathon. His mind's eye pictured an army of rubber stamping Percys
unable to deviate long enough to treat any piece of parchment or
indeed, any person, as an individual.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry Hermione; I know you wanted to get to Yackandandah and your
parents as soon as possible. We should be able to get there tomorrow
sometime, as long as the new thought box gets here first thing,"
Jonathon was trying to console her but she didn't look the least
bit comforted.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
doesn't matter," mumbled Hermione as she sat heavily on a large
rock nearby. Harry thought she suddenly looked rather depressed and
he didn't blame her one bit. Ron sat down beside her and pulled her
into a hug. With alarm, Harry realised that she was crying. Ron
pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket, inspected it for grime and
offered it to her. Hermione took one look at it and buried her face
in his jumper instead.</p><p class="calibre8">"On
the bright side you'll get to see the sun setting at the Rock,"
said Jonathon. "Tourists come from all over the world to watch
that. It's not the best of situations but most of the people around
here are Muggles, few charms, they won't know we're even here."</p><p class="calibre8">"Looks
like we're camping out!" said Bert. She and George seemed pleased
and Bill and Ginny seemed unconcerned. Fleur grimaced only a little
but Harry scowled and swore, Hermione burst into a fresh wave of
tears wailing something that sounded like 'don't make me cook
fungus' and Ron let out a long, low moan. Ginny threw questioning
looks at the three of them.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
hate camping," grumbled Harry as he sat heavily next to Hermione on
the rock.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
is so wrong with camping?" asked Ginny, looking between the three
of them, her confusion evident on her face. "You all liked going to
the World Cup."</p><p class="calibre8">"We've
seen the dark side of camping since then, Ginny," said Ron
dramatically, advancing on Ginny and waving his arms through the air
as he talked. "Especially the, 'sorry we don't have any food',
kind of camping. And let me tell you, stewed mushrooms are a load of
dragon dung. And camping in the middle of winter, in the snow, isn't
any picnic either! So forgive me if I appear less than enthused by
the prospect of repeating that experience in the middle of bloody
nowhere! "</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
guessing you three underplayed your whole camping experience last
year then?" said Ginny as she backed slowly away from Ron. "Well,
to be fair, it wasn't quite how I envisioned waking up on my
seventeenth birthday either you know but-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Merlin Ginny! I forgot tomorrow was your birthday!" wailed Hermione
suddenly. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Oh this is all my fault!"</p><p class="calibre8">She
threw herself at Harry, sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.
Harry wrapped his arms tentatively around her, uncertain if it was
the right thing to do and patted her slowly on the back. Ron stopped
his advance on Ginny and hurried back to Harry and Hermione, kneeling
on front of Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry Hermione," he said. "I shouldn't be making such a big
deal of it. It's only one night. I can do it for only one night
and, well it doesn't look like there's any fungus going to grow
around this place anyway. Please, don't cry, I'm sorry."
Hermione looked up at him and swallowed before nodding.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay,"
she said. "I can do this, we can do this."</p><p class="calibre8">She
grabbed one of Harry's hands rather tightly and he tried not to
wince as she squeezed harder. Ron was in the same predicament if the
grimace on his face was anything to go by, and the two of them looked
at each other as she pulled herself together. Suddenly she let go of
their hands and Harry began madly rubbing his hand with the other,
trying to get back the circulation that had been stolen from him. He
soon found his face squashed up against Hermione's shoulder, his
glasses askew on his face and his nose inches from Ron's as
Hermione pulled them both into a hug from which Harry could see no
reasonable means of escape. He had no idea what had come over her and
could think of nothing that might explain her behaviour. Harry looked
to Ron, hoping for an answer but all he got was a shrug that Harry
thought might mean Ron didn't know either.</p><p class="calibre8">Although
Harry wasn't used to comforting or holding close anyone but Ginny
he was fairly sure that the things he might do to Ginny right now did
not apply to Hermione. All of a sudden, as he was contemplating his
next action Harry was released and Hermione was wiping her eyes with
Ron's handkerchief and proclaiming them the best friends ever and
they had better not leave her alone for one minute of this whole
camping thing or she was sure she wouldn't survive.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
a bit dramatic innit?" mumbled Ron. "Surely camping wasn't that
bad. We're just remembering it that way, or something, yeah?"
Harry and Hermione shook their heads slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
really was that bad, Ron," said Harry seriously.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was worse than that bad," agreed Hermione. "Promise me we won't
ever have to go camping again?" Harry nodded solemnly. George
started chuckling.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sure it's not that bad," he said. "I mean look, clear skies, a
camp fire; we can tell stories or … sing. Be an adventure!"
Hermione tilted her head to the side as if considering his words.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I suppose if we aren't shut up in a tent, hiding, you know, from
the evil forces of the world," she murmured.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
there's no snow here," added Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
if there's food …" continued Ron. The three of them looked at
each other and took a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you three aren't the biggest bunch of drama queens," said George,
rolling his eyes. Ron crossed his arms and glared at him but neither
he nor Harry or Hermione responded to that accusation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on Alberta," Ernie said as he prepared to Disapparate. "Let's
get ya hand seen to and bring back the supplies."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me that."</p><p class="calibre8">Bert
and Ernie Disapparated with a loud crack while Jonathon settled down
on the red dusty earth to wait for their return.</p><p class="calibre8">"Jonathon
what's bone point or whatever Bert said?" George asked with a
frown on his face as he plopped down beside the Australian.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pointing
the bone's a curse."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
sort of a curse?" asked Ginny, quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Killing
one, leaves no trace, never fails," said Jonathon simply. He looked
around, eyes narrowed, when Ginny and Ron went pale and Hermione's
eyes widened in shock. Harry could feel Bill's eyes on him as his
breath hitched in his throat and he suddenly felt unbelievably cold.
"Ernie's a wizard o'course and he went to the whitefella magic
school but he also knows the black magic. One of his old Uncles is a
kurditcha man, that's like a wise man – or medicine man some call
it – they gotta be wizards though, stands to reason considering
what they do. Uncle taught him the magic from before whitefellas were
even here. If one of the people broke the law the kurditcha man puts
a curse on 'em. They have this bone, acts like a wand really, that
they prepare some special way and they point it at the person and
curse them. Lots of people think it kills slowly, reckon people just
waste away, but I dunno …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sounds
more like <em class="calibre9">Avada
Kedavra</em>
to me," muttered George.</p><p class="calibre8">"Zactly,"
said Jonathon nodding.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
doesn't kill you slowly," said Ron softly. No one was looking at
Harry or said anything further.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,"
said Hermione briskly as the silence stretched out, "it sounds like
a positively horrible curse anyway." Harry shoved both his hands in
his pockets and stared fixedly at the toe of his worn trainers.
Jonathon seemed oblivious to the thickening air that surrounded them,
continuing to talk animatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I wouldn't want to die slowly," he said. "Nice and quick,
s'long as it didn't hurt." No one spoke and Jonathon cleared
his throat awkwardly. "Ernie's mum's a Muggle but she believes
in pointing the bone and as far as she's concerned Ernie's got
enough powers to make it happen. She lets him do about any magic but
that. It's serious stuff anyway, He's not the kurditcha so he
shouldn't be doin' it in any case but he likes to spook people
..." The silence was still strained and Jonathon gave up trying to
fill the void with words and fell silent.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dying
doesn't hurt," said Harry softly, staring at something beyond the
red horizon. "The Killing Curse hurts but dying doesn't."</p><p class="calibre8">He
felt ruthless at that moment and struggled to contain his emotions.
It wasn't Jonathon's fault, most people spoke rather casually of
death. Part of him wanted to just shout and scream, to get his
feelings out of his system as quickly as possible. The part of him
that could see Ginny held it in check. She was standing perfectly
still, her face incredibly pale, freckles standing out sharply and
her eyes shut. Her chest was rising and falling shallowly and her
hands were clenched into fists although she had obviously tried to
hide this by folding her arms and trying to tuck her hands out of
sight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry
…" said Ron tentatively and Harry looked up at him, still
fighting his internal battle not to fly completely off the handle.
Ron didn't say anything else but somehow Harry felt his own
emotions reel themselves back in where he could keep a handle on them
and he let out a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
hardest part of dying is leaving behind the people you love," said
Harry. He looked up at the sky, his emotions roiling in his chest,
Ron's presence keeping them from flying out like vicious knives.
"But when you've got people who love you waiting for you <em class="calibre9">there</em>
it's so easy to just keep going … on." The others were silent
and Harry could sense them watching him as his internal struggle
continued. He lowered his eyes and looked to Ginny who had opened her
eyes and was looking at him, the expression on her face a mixture of
fear and curiosity. He had not spoken so candidly of his experience
in the Forest before and he could feel anticipation rolling off of
them all.</p><p class="calibre8">"Coming
back for the people you love is a lot easier than going to die for
them," he said softly into the stillness. He heard Hermione sniff
and looked over at her and Ron. Hermione had tears rolling down her
cheeks and Ron was biting his lip as if that would prevent the tears
from falling from his own glistening eyes. "I expect most people
don't get a choice. But it's not hard to … stay; it would be so
easy to just stay."</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you want to … well," said Ron, "to … stay, to go … on?"
Harry almost felt, rather than heard, everyone suck in a breath and
hold it while they waited for him to answer. He lowered his gaze to
the ground and traced a pattern in the red dust with the toe of his
left trainer.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think so," he said at last, "not really. A part of me
perhaps felt it would be okay if I did. It was quiet and peaceful and
there's no hurt or pain there. My parents are there." He paused
aware that Ginny was now crying silent tears but he felt unable to go
to her.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was peaceful, no pain …" said George slowly and Harry heard the
unsaid question. Was Fred feeling that too? Or was Fred in as much
pain as he was?</p><p class="calibre8">"I
spoke to Remus," said Harry looking up at George and stilling his
foot. "I saw him with the Stone. He was sorry he wouldn't be with
Teddy but he wasn't sad. I didn't want to leave you all but I
wasn't sad. I think sadness and pain is reserved for the living. I
came back to stop the pain. There was already too much pain in this
world. Coming back would make it less. I came back for you, for all
of you." Everyone was crying now and Harry felt warm tears slide
down his own cheeks as Ginny moved towards him. He enfolded her in
his arms, holding her close but he didn't feel sad. It felt good to
talk about it. He looked up at George and saw him smiling through his
tears.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
the git's got the easy half," he said, "and I've got you
lot." Ron pulled him into a hug.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
Ron said, "always." Harry looked back down at Ginny and lowered
his head to kiss her tears away. Her cheeks tasted salty and her
eyelids fluttered shut as she stood in his embrace, her hands on his
chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
hardest thing I have ever done is walk away from you," he
whispered. "To listen to your pain was excruciating. It could be
the easiest thing in the world to die but if I have a choice I will
always, always come back to you." As Ginny opened her eyes and he
looked into them Harry saw that although they were sparkling with
tears, the pain on the edges was gone and he leaned down and kissed
her softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
I will always be here," said Ginny softly as he pulled away. She
reached up and caressed his cheek and Harry closed his eyes and
leaned into her touch. The rest of the world fell away and Ginny was
his whole existence. He felt her soft touch where she stroked his
cheek and ran her fingers through his hair. Her thighs were pressed
against his own, he could feel the softness of her stomach against
his and he could smell her.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
been through so much," Ginny whispered. Harry said nothing but let
his hands drift up and down Ginny's back while she continued to
caress his cheek and stroke his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">They
stood there, Ginny wrapped in Harry's arms, while they caressed
each other, oblivious to the world. Harry revelled in her sweet
touch. Her fingertips blazed trails of fire across his skin and his
body responded to hers. His eyes were still closed, but somehow Harry
knew she was smiling and in response he pulled her closer. He knew it
would make his reaction to her touch more obvious to her. He opened
his eyes expecting to see her cheeks flushed with the trademark
Weasley blush but she seemed unabashed by his physical reaction and
smiled up at him. Her eyes were filled with desire and Harry felt
irresistibly drawn to her despite the presence of three of her
brothers. Harry bent his head to kiss her roughly, giving in to his
own desire. It was not a sweet and tender kiss that merely told her
how much he cared for her but one that showed her how much he <em class="calibre9">wanted</em>
her, for at that moment he wanted her, he desired her and the feeling
thrilled and terrified him and when he broke off the kiss he was
breathing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny's
lips were swollen and her cheeks were flushed and Harry felt like he
had claimed her lips for his own and marked them. He realised what
Arthur had meant when he referred to 'claiming' the woman that
was his wife. Harry knew he was both impatient and content to wait to
claim her body but he knew he had already claimed her mind and soul,
and she his. Their bodies were the only part left to claim.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
love you," he said roughly, his emotions still raw from talking
about dying and from letting his desire reach out and touch her.
Ginny looked at him then, letting her own raw passion spill from her
gaze, the unspoken things swirling between them as they stayed
wrapped in each other's arms, uninterrupted by the others until the
stillness was broken by the crack of Bert and Ernie's Apparition.
The world tumbled back in on them and Harry and Ginny pulled apart
with one last lingering caress.</p><p class="calibre8">Bert
and Ernie were carrying an enormous amount of supplies, Bert sporting
a fat white bandage on her hand. A large canvas bag clanked and
clanged as it fell from Ernie's arms when he tried to set down his
burdens. He was carrying a large plastic box by the handle in one
hand and several small parcels were balanced precariously in the
crook of his other arm. Bert was carrying several plastic shopping
bags in her good hand and had a smaller canvas bag wedged under her
other arm. Jonathon hurried over to relieve Bert of her burdens and
Bill and George sprang forward to assist Ernie. Harry was soon
immersed in helping set up their camp for the night.</p><p class="calibre8">It
seemed as though Jonathon, Bert and Ernie had been camping before.
They erected two Muggle tents in the shadow of the Roobus in a matter
of moments. On inspecting the inside Ron was both amused and
disgusted to learn that they were no bigger on the inside than they
were on the outside. He repeatedly expressed his outrage that there
was no kitchen until Hermione silenced him with a very stern glare
that Harry was sure she had learned from Ron's own mother. Harry
asked why the bus didn't just produce beds like the Knight bus as
he had assumed, but apparently the Roobus didn't have that feature
as it wasn't designed for night time use.</p><p class="calibre8">Ernie
upended one of the bags he'd brought with him and enlarged the
contents which turned out to be a number of sleeping bags rolled
together with thin foam mattresses. Pacing around for a moment he
unrolled one of them and spread it out before summoning a number of
rocks and arranging them in a circle about two feet in diameter. He
dug a shallow pit in the middle of them before making a similar
circle on the other side of the sleeping bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pass
us yer swag, Johno," he muttered as he levitated more rocks for
another circle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
call me that," grumbled Jonathon as he picked up another of the
rolled sleeping bags. Harry watched as Ernie and Jonathon unrolled
three more of the swags and created more stone circles, placing the
swags strategically between two stone circles. Tossing three of the
remaining rolls at Bert, Hermione and Ginny he indicated wordlessly
that they were to go in the larger of the two tents. The other two he
handed to Bill and jerked his head in the direction of the remaining
tent.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
we sleeping outside?" asked Ron clearly suspicious of these
sleeping arrangements. Jonathon nodded shortly as he explained that
he was going for wood and Disapparated with a loud crack. Ron glared
at Ernie. "Are you mad?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
the problem?" asked Ernie. He gazed upwards. "'Snot going to
rain."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
– but it's … outside! What if we get cold?"</p><p class="calibre8">"S'what
the fires are fer," said Ernie shortly shaking his head. "Poms
..."</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
don't roll in your sleep, you don't want to end up in a fire,"
said Bert as she rustled in one of the plastic shopping bags,
eventually pulling out three toothbrushes and a tube of toothpaste in
an enamel cup, tipping several enamel plates and tin cups onto the
dirt in the process.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
come Bill gets to sleep in a tent?" asked Ron indignantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum's
only got two tents."</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you'd like to join me and Fleur Ron, I'm sure we could put you up
for one night of our <em class="calibre9">honeymoon</em>,"
said Bill mischievously. Ron shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
thanks," he said shortly. "And make sure you do a silencing
charm."</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop!"
cried George plaintively. "Stop these images from assaulting my
brain!" Jonathon arrived back then, carrying a massive armful of
firewood. He and Ernie distributed it among the small stone circles,
setting it to make fires. Hermione emerged from the luggage
compartment with her own toiletries and this prompted Harry to go and
find his own necessary items.</p><p class="calibre8">When
he'd found all he thought he'd need he saw that Ernie and Bert
had transfigured one of the bus chairs into a table to hold the pile
of crockery, an enormous frying pan and a large canteen with a tap at
the bottom that Harry had seen Ernie pull from the luggage
compartment. He and Bill were filling it using the Aguamenti charm.
Jonathon was tending several of the fires and they crackled merrily
on the desert floor. Suddenly Bert dropped a large pot heavily on her
foot and swore softly. She'd forgotten her injured hand and tried
to pick it up with both hands. Unfortunately she looked rather
comical hopping on one foot with one hand bandaged within an inch of
its life by Ernie's enthusiastic mother.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you okay? Is your foot all right?" asked Jonathon, frantically
rushing to her aid and reaching out to steady her. He grabbed Bert's
injured hand and she yelped. Jonathon looked chagrined. "Is your
hand all right?" Bert nodded, grimacing wryly at her bandage
encased hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think Ernie's mum went a bit overboard with the bandages though,"
she said. "It's a pity you don't know any healing spells."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a pity I'm not of age today then," muttered Ginny poking at one
of the fires moodily with a stick. Harry looked at her curiously and
then saw Bill was looking at Ginny with raised eyebrows. Harry was
beginning to think that there were a few things he needed to find out
about Ginny. Things he had not noticed or she had not revealed and he
had a sinking suspicion they were all related to the previous year at
Hogwarts. His thoughts were interrupted by Hermione who seemed to be
quite agitated by Bert's injury. She was talking to Ron while he
explored the supplies Bert and Ernie had brought back with them. She
sounded quite distressed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't bring any dittany," Hermione was fretting. "I knew I'd
forget something." Ron stopped rifling through the food bags (and
being slapped on the hand by Fleur) and turned to her. Reaching out
to Hermione and putting his hand on her arm Ron spoke to her softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay, Hermione," he said. "Relax. You don't have to remember
everything."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
who's going to then? I mean it's such a simple thing, to be
prepared for every emergency," rattled Hermione urgently. "I'm
always prepared for things like this. I don't know why I forgot.
I've let my guard down and now we're all going to suffer!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked at her alarmed. She seemed capable of going on about her
perceived shortcomings for hours. Ron pulled her into his arms, and
unless Harry was mistaken he was <em class="calibre9">crooning</em>
to her. With a few well chosen words Ron calmed Hermione down,
reassured her that she didn't have to remember everything and
managed to make her smile. Harry wondered if Ron was Hermione's
best source of comfort as Ginny was his. He knew he'd never been
able to calm Hermione like that. Ron made it look so easy. Harry
began to question his ability to calm Ginny if she got up a head of
steam. If she was upset, would it be him she turned to and would he
be able to calm and soothe her? Harry smiled as he watched Ron tease
Hermione by telling her that she had better let her guard down
sometimes or they'd not have very much fun. Hermione blushed at his
suggestive tone and busied herself at the Transfigured table,
straightening a pile of dishes that did not need straightening.</p><p class="calibre8">At
sunset Jonathon persuaded Ernie that they could stop making camp and
watch the Rock, so together they brought some of the chairs out of
the bus and sat down to gaze at the giant monolith as the sun sank
below the horizon. Harry found the changing colours and the shades
caused by the shadows to be one of the most beautiful and mesmerising
things that he had seen in a long time and as he watched the sun go
down he listened to Ginny exclaim over the way the desert lit up like
it was on fire. It probably looked a little absurd, sitting in a
roomy recliner, next to an electric blue bus, in the middle of the
desert, Ginny squashed beside him while he absently stroked her hair.
It was an odd situation to be sure, but Harry didn't feel out of
place. Perhaps it was having Ginny by his side but he felt somehow as
if he was exactly where he was meant to be.</p><p class="calibre8">When
the sun had gone down, and before the light vanished entirely Ernie
and Jonathon began to fix something to eat. Harry felt rather useless
as he stood watching the proceedings but Bert, Ernie and Jonathon
seemed to move like a well oiled machine. Ernie's mum proved to be
Molly's kindred spirit and had packed them enough food to last a
week. There were vegetables, eggs, dried fruit, a loaf of bread,
sugar and flour. As Bert opened the plastic box that Ernie had been
carrying Jonathon prepared the frying pan, perching it on some of the
hot coals that had begun to form in the largest of the fires. Her
injured hand failing her, Bert dropped a wrapped block of butter on
the ground and a cloud of the red dust rose up and settled like a
thin film inside the box.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don'
wreck the esky," groused Ernie as he used his wand to remove the
dirt. Harry peered inside as he and Ginny went to help Bert and
discovered it contained several ice packs, a block of cheese, several
cartons of milk and various packages of meat.</p><p class="calibre8">"A
bit of dirt won't wreck it, you old woman," grumbled Bert.
Jonathon sighed loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
start," he warned. "I knew there was a reason I stopped camping
with you two."</p><p class="calibre8">"And
I thought it were 'coz you couldn't stan' bein' near Bert of
a night withou' throwin' 'er ta the groun' and-" mumbled
Ernie before Jonathon elbowed him sharply in the side and handed him
the flour and a carton of milk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Make
the damper or go catch a lizard, just shut ya mouth before I shut it
for you," hissed Jonathon. "And find ya manners and good humour
while ya at it." Ernie shoved the milk and flour at Bert and
stalked off into the darkening scrub, his choice clear. Bert just
scowled after him muttering that being the girl didn't mean she had
to cook. Harry stifled a laugh at the look of solidarity Hermione
threw her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
make the damper then," said Jonathon exasperatedly and stalked off
to the table with the milk and flour. He didn't hear Bert, watching
his retreating backside, say what a pity it was that he'd stopped
camping with them as she would have enjoyed being thrown to the
ground. George leapt towards Ginny, covering her ears with his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
in front of the child!" he said dramatically as Ginny fought him
off.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
help me George," she cried as she twisted out of his grasp finally.
"Tomorrow morning you'd better watch your back!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Be
afraid, little brother, be very afraid!" laughed Bill and Ginny
stalked off and stomped into the girls' tent letting the flap swing
shut after her.</p><p class="calibre8">Ernie
returned a short time later, carrying two lizards. Harry watched,
fascinated and repulsed as Ernie prepared them and propped them over
the fire to cook. Jonathon had combined the milk and flour to make a
lump of dough that he buried in the coals to cook and Bert expertly
sliced some potatoes and onions setting the enormous frying pan over
the fire to cook lamb chops and the vegetables. Fleur was looking
distastefully at the entire production but George had been extremely
enthusiastic about the process and proved an able assistant. He and
Jonathon laughed and joked as they worked together and Ron smiled as
they chased Bert around the campsite with their hands covered in
dough. George seemed so carefree and Harry wondered if he was really
doing okay or if it was all an act because the kind of hurt George
had ran deep. Maybe it was a good start.</p><p class="calibre8">The
stars had come out by the time the food was cooked and they ate by
the light of the stars and several glowing campfires. The lump of
dough that Jonathon had buried in the coals to cook had proved to be
a kind of bread called damper and when she'd stopped complaining
about perceived women's work Bert had taught Ginny how to make
damper to which they added dried fruit. The food was plain, but
cooked and eaten outdoors it tasted like a delicacy. When they had
finished and they lay sprawled, sated in their chairs Hermione and
Bill lazily cleaned the pans and dishes with<em class="calibre9">
Scourgify</em>
and levitated them back to lie in a haphazard pile on the small
table. The fires died down to burning embers that gave off a
comforting heat and the darkness settled over the outback like an
inky blanket. Harry and Ginny sat cuddled together in the recliner
they had occupied earlier, their feet entwined on the raised
footrest.</p><p class="calibre8">With
lazy contentment, under the cover of darkness, Harry traced his
fingers up and down her body, heedless of where they travelled and he
explored her stomach, chuckling softly as she squirmed when he
dragged his fingertips lightly across its surface. He caressed the
round softness of her bottom and the curve of her hips, feeling
slightly envious of the denim that was closer to her skin than he
was. Ginny shivered as he drew a line down her backbone and he leaned
down to press a sweet kiss to her neck. The passion that had filled
him earlier did not return in the same way but he could feel it
simmering underneath the barrier he had erected to keep it in check.
It was what drove him to explore her body but now was not the time to
let it go. Even if they had not been in the open and surrounded by
eight other people it was too soon. Only when he could control it
could he let it rule. And so Harry kissed her softly, caressing her
tongue and lips with his own while his hands traced repeating
patterns on the small patches of skin he could find under her jumper.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't see any stars I recognise," said Ron suddenly into the
stillness. George laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you even pass your Astronomy OWL?" he chuckled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
I did thank you very much, unlike you Mr Three OWLS," retorted Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
I earned those three OWLS fair and square," commented George
conversationally.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
really?" said Hermione drily from her seat beside Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yep,"
said George, "Fred got the Potions and Transfiguration OWLS and I
got the Charms and Herbology OWLS. We both managed a Defence Against
the Dark Arts one each. Didn't need us both to get them all did
we?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really,"
said Hermione exasperatedly, "That's a bit short sighted of you
both isn't it? I mean what about now that -" She broke off and
Harry was certain she was horrified at her own train of thought and
that she had voiced it.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
worry too much Hermione," said George lightly. "Ron's got his
Potions and Transfiguration OWLS. Besides Fred and I taught each
other anyway we just didn't have time for the actual study
involved, much more important things to do."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
like creating mayhem and mischief wherever you went," piped up
Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"True,"
agreed George. The group fell silent then and Harry looked up at the
stars as Ginny danced her fingers over his chest and across his
stomach. He closed his eyes and let his other senses pick up the
other sensations; the scent of her, her hip pressed against his, her
hair as it brushed against his arm and tickled his chin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
I found Vega!" said Ron suddenly. "But it's in the wrong spot.
Where is north …" Harry could hear Ron twisting in his seat and
imagined his perplexed expression as he searched the night sky.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
you see Alpha Centauri?" asked Jonathon. Ron made an exasperated
noise and Jonathon chuckled. Using his lit wand tip he pointed out
Arcturus low on the Western Horizon he guided them to Antares
overhead but Ron was unconvinced.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
where's Scorpius then?" he snorted. "How can you lot see
anything down here?" Jonathon laughed. Conjuring a telescope he
showed Ron where Scorpius was.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
it's upside down!" said Ron incredulously. "And where did the
Pleiades go? It's winter isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
visible at this time of night in summer, along with Orion and
Gemini," said Bert. Ron grunted. Obviously Ron did not like his
world being turned on its axis like this as he grumbled that he
couldn't even figure out which way anything was supposed to be.
Jonathon showed him how to find south using the Southern Cross
constellation and began pointing out other stars and constellations.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
it's all upside down," said Ron again, rather petulantly after he
finally saw the Teapot that Jonathon was pointing out in the
Sagittarius constellation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
you are Down Under, mate," said Bert.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
upside down if you know the right stories," said Ernie, "stupid
to use Northern constellations down here, all upside down."</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
Sirius?" asked Harry suddenly. He had been trying to locate the
brightest star in the sky while Ron created a fuss about things, but
he had been unable to find it. Jonathon swung his wand to point low
on the horizon towards the south east.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sirius
should come up about two or three tomorrow morning," he said and
Ernie laughed. Jonathon shifted slightly in the darkness. "Orion
and his dog will be upside down of course which would make Sirius
harder for you lot to find."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you're saying if we looked for Orion's head we'd have to travel
up, not down, to find the rest of the constellation?" clarified
Ginny. "That would make Sirius on the other side and the dog
constellation upside down?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sirius,
the upside down dead dog!" chortled Ernie. He didn't notice how
quiet the rest of the camp fell at his words but Harry did. He knew
that Ginny was holding her breath and he could practically feel
Hermione and Ron's eyes on him. In the shadows he saw Bill turn
towards him and George sit up abruptly in his chair. They were all
waiting for his reaction which bubbled up inside him like the bubbles
in a can of soft drink and burst out, shattering the stillness as
Harry laughed. Ginny stiffed and then laughed when his shoulders
shook with laughter and he leaned his head on her shoulder as he
succumbed to the hilarity that welled up inside him. He could hear
Ron and George join his laughter and faintly he heard Hermione weakly
protest before she joined in as well.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't think Ern was that funny," said Bert eventually after they
had calmed down a little, hiccupping only occasionally. Harry only
shook his head as more silent laughter bubbled up. He knew, somehow
that Sirius, and probably Remus and his father, would appreciate the
joke and the irony of the situation and all he could do was laugh.
Bert went on. "You should tell 'em the real stories Ern."</p><p class="calibre8">"The
stars are the ancestors," began Ernie as they fell silent listening
to the storytelling rhythm of Ernie's voice. "Different mobs have
different dreaming 'bout the stars but mostly they is ancestors
gone on before, after the creation of the land. Them stars you call
Pleiades is seven women, jus' like in your stories. They are
running from their pursuer. Is different for other mobs though,
resting place of the dead for some."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
is there more than one story?" asked Hermione and Harry pondered
the same question as Ernie replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"More
than one mob," he said. "Most all the stars is ancestors though.
It's connected to the land and different people got different land
so the stories aren't gunna be the same, aye? Some are lost too.
When the whitefellas moved the people away from their lands and
families, they took the little kids away, y'know, they destroyed
their kinships and their connections to the land. The dreaming was
lost." Ernie was solemn as he spoke about the loss of his peoples'
cultures and Harry, knowing what it was like to be taken from your
family and raised in a place where you did not belong, losing your
family and your heritage in the process, felt a connection to them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
what about Scorpius then?" asked Ron. "If it's upside down is
it still a scorpion?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
said Jonathon, "It's a crocodile. The crocodile's head is where
the scorpion's tail is."</p><p class="calibre8">"And
see here, in the Milky Way," and Bert pointed out a void with her
wand, "that's an emu there, in the shadows."</p><p class="calibre8">"Orion's
an emu too, in some mobs," interjected Ernie. "There's warriors
and hunters and eagles up there. Southern Cross got lots of different
dreaming." It was getting late and the fires were dying down. The
absence of natural light made the stars easier to see and they stayed
awake watching the stars, pointing out the constellations and telling
stories until one by one they drifted off to bed.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
fell asleep on Harry's shoulder shortly before midnight and he
carried her into her tent, laying her carefully on one of the swags.
He removed her shoes and tucked her into the sleeping bag before
smoothing the hair off her face and pressing a tender kiss to her
forehead. He came out of the tent to find Ernie tucked up in one of
the swags laid out between the fires and Bill and Fleur already gone
into their tent. Ron and Hermione was still sitting, side by side,
talking earnestly in quiet whispers and Jonathon and Bert were so
tied up with each other that Harry was entirely unsure where one
finished and the other began. He sat down next to George in the chair
vacated by Ernie. George was leaning back and looking up into the
sky.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you think they're up there, with the stars?" asked George
quietly. Harry knew he meant those who had died, gone before.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe,"
said Harry, tilting his head back to look at the stars. "They're
somewhere they can see us. Mum and dad are proud of me, so're
Sirius and Remus. If they couldn't see me, how could they be
proud?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But
how do you know that, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"When
I used the Stone, the Resurrection Stone, I saw them along with
Remus," said Harry, looking up into the vast sky. "No one else
could have seen them though …. Sirius said … he said they were a
part of me." Harry looked at George who was staring at the glowing
embers of the fire in front of him. Hermione had gone and Ron had
burrowed into one of the swags and was starting to snore gently. Bert
and Jonathon stood near the girls' tent sharing a last lingering
kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
they're a part of you," said George slowly as he turned to look
at Harry, "then they never really left." Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think they ever truly leave us, y'know?" he said softly.
"They live on because we loved them and they loved us. All we have
to do is remember them. Maybe they are up in the stars, but they're
right here, too." And Harry placed his hand over his own heart.
George stared at Harry's hand for a moment before he looked back up
into the night.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
miss Fred, so much," he said. "I feel torn in two. It doesn't
seem fair that he's with me, but I can't feel him."</p><p class="calibre8">"All
you have to do is remember," said Harry. "He's always with you,
just let yourself feel."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't want to feel," George whispered. "Feelings hurt … too
much."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know," said Harry simply.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you
really think he's not sad?" asked George then. "You know, up
there, in heaven or wherever." Harry nodded. He smiled a little
wryly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've
met far too many dead people," he grimaced at his bluntness but
George chuckled softly. "Only the ghosts are sad. If someone's a
ghost it's like … like they aren't finished. They're scared
or worried, got something left to do. But people who've gone … on
… they have all been smiling. They're happy. Fred's not a
ghost. He'd not have left us alone if he was."</p><p class="calibre8">"He'd
have been water bombing us with Peeves," added George. Harry
couldn't help it, he laughed and George joined in. After a moment
George sobered. "If he's not a ghost, he's happy?" Harry saw
a lone tear escape George's eye and roll down his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably,"
he whispered. "There's peace there, I'm sure of it. I think the
tears, the sadness, are reserved for here. There's no tears in
heaven." George's face was wet now as the tears rolled silently
down his cheeks.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
couldn't bear it if he was sad too. This just hurts so much,"
said George as he wrapped his arms around his knees and laid his head
on them. His tears dripped slowly down his face and onto his knees,
soaking his jeans and Harry, unable to stop himself, moved closer to
George and wrapped an arm around him, holding George as he cried,
silent tears sliding down his own nose. George quietened but made no
move to leave Harry's embrace.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay to feel, George," whispered Harry roughly, his own throat
scratchy and raw. "Let yourself feel him, he's always with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Merlin, this just hurts," said George brokenly and a loud sob broke
the stillness as it tore from his throat. Harry saw Ron sit up
abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred
is right here," said Harry softly, reaching out to touch George's
chest on the place over his heart. "Those we love never really
leave us, let yourself feel." Harry felt his heart breaking as
George closed his eyes, pain etched on his features, perhaps battling
internally. Eventually George pulled away, eyes shimmering with
tears, half a smile on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Living
hurts," he said simply. "How are you still sane after …
everything? I sometimes think I'm going to go mental from this
pain." Harry stared off into the distance.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sometimes
I think I nearly did," he admitted.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
stopped you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny,"
Harry said softly, stirring up the coals on the fire in front of
them. Ron had not moved, he sat motionless watching them. "I don't
know how to explain it. She … keeps me here. All of you … the
love … but Ginny's different." George wiped his cheeks with the
back of his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
in love with her," he said. He wasn't mocking and he wasn't
accusing, rather he sounded awed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I am," breathed Harry. "My life is completely tied up in hers, I
can't help it. I don't know how I could even begin to live
without her now. There are people missing from my life, but with her
… I feel it less." Harry didn't know if he was making sense to
George. Trying to express how Ginny made him feel didn't seem
possible. It was like being alive and numb to pain all at the same
time.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
are still with me, those I've lost," he continued. "They're
part of me. Sirius, Remus, my mum and dad they left their mark on me.
They've protected me from Dementors, all my life. Remus taught me
how to do a Patronus and they fuelled it. It's a stag, like my dad,
y'know? But Ginny … I reckon she fuels it now. All of them, they
are all here." Placing a hand over his heart, he could feel it
beating. George stared at Harry's hand for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
just have to let the love get bigger than the pain," Harry said
simply.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Harry," George said, he paused and looked at Harry with a sly grin
on his face. "D'you reckon it's finding a bird that helps?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny's
not a bird," muttered Harry. "I wouldn't let her or Hermione
hear you say that." George laughed softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I don't reckon I will," he acquiesced. "Seriously though, d'you
think girls, well that one special girl, can do it? Fix the pain?
Block it out, take over. You know, if you love her enough?" Harry
considered that for a moment, tilting his head to one side as he
stared into the darkness.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
find the right girl and kissing her is better than Firewhiskey," he
said eventually.</p><p class="calibre8">"Blimey
Harry, when did you get so wise?" Harry shrugged and they both
looked up into the night sky. It was well after midnight now and
Harry could see Rigel on the North East horizon. Sirius would be
visible soon and he felt an overwhelming urge to see the star. After
several long minutes he and George said goodnight and quietly made
their way to the two remaining swags and lay down. Harry caught
Ron's eye and Ron nodded at him before burrowing himself back into
his own swag. As the Dog Star came up over the horizon, Harry could
hear George's even breathing and before gently sliding off to sleep
under the southern sky, Harry made a wish on the star that George's
troubles would melt away so that he would be able to feel without the
pain.</p>
