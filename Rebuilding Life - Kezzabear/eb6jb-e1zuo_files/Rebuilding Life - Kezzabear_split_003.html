<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_4">*Chapter 3*: Chapter 3</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Mourning Childhood</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry had no idea
how long he stayed there on the steps of Hogwarts in Ginny's arms.
He stayed long after his tears had dried up and he felt like a wrung
out wet rag, listless and unable to move. The whole time, Ginny held
him, soothing and comforting. It could have been hours later when he
sat up slowly. He had no idea, he'd lost track of the time. Taking
his glasses from his face he examined the salty tear spots that
streaked the lenses and cleaned them on the hem of his shirt. He put
his glasses back on and looked up at Ginny. She was gazing at him
with a small smile on her lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi," she
whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi," Harry
whispered back. "I was going to look for you but I got a bit …
erm, waylaid by your brothers and then your dad-" Harry broke off
and turned to stare out over the grounds, looking at the pockets of
devastation that still marked the battle that had been fought. He
felt Ginny entwine her small fingers with his larger ones and softly
caress his hand and he looked down at their hands, joined together.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't have
anything to do alone anymore," he said. "No one's trying to get
to me. We can be together, if you want to." Harry looked up at her
and Ginny smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd like
that Harry," she whispered, and without thinking about it Harry
leaned over and captured her lips in a kiss. He felt her hands slide
up his arms and sneak into his hair and as he deepened the kiss he
slid his own hands down her sides and his arms around her waist,
pulling her closer to him, sliding one hand up into her hair and
caressing her neck. The sensation of being in her arms and kissing
her again made him feel just a little bit giddy but he didn't want
to stop. He wanted it to go on forever. Some of the pain and despair
seemed to melt away as he lost himself in her embrace and the good
memories and the happy feelings overshadowed the despair he had been
feeling earlier.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!" Harry
dragged his lips away from Ginny and gave her a little crooked grin.
Then he turned to look at Ron who was standing at the top of the
steps in front of the closed doors glaring daggers at him. Harry just
smiled benignly before standing up and looking down at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Want to go for
a walk?" he asked. Ginny nodded and turned to Ron and gave him a
little wave as she rose to her feet. Clasping her hand Harry tugged
her down the steps and they headed off into the sunshine.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't think
I'm not going to tell George!" Ron muttered as they left. Harry
just laughed, it felt good to laugh but suddenly all wrong and he
stopped abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What does that
mean?" Ginny was saying. "Who cares what he tells George? It's
not like what I do is any of his business." She stopped as Harry
pulled her closer to his side.</p><p class="calibre8">"What am I
going to do now, Ginny? There's so much left to do. There are so
many lives that have been ruined. So many people have died,"
Harry's voice cracked on the last word and he stumbled over his
next thought. "How do we start to rebuild from here? What do I need
to do now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, listen
to me," Ginny said as she stopped and turned him to face her. "We
don't have to know all the answers now. We don't have to make all
our plans now. You don't have to be the grown up now. Let the
Ministry figure out how to rebuild, let the adults do it. They've
done it before, you can help them. They don't need to help you
anymore. You said you don't have anything to do alone now. Let
someone else do it." She suddenly looked very small and it seemed
as though a veil of sadness had suddenly been drawn over her face.</p><p class="calibre8">"If anyone's
got a right to mourn Harry, it's you," said Ginny. "I don't
think you've ever really done that, not properly." Tears began to
cascade down Ginny's cheeks. "It's not fair that you haven't
had a chance to do that before. Because it hurts so badly and you
just need so much to – to say, say goodbye." And then Harry was
gathering her to him and stroking her hair and whispering words of
comfort into her ear as she cried into his shirt. Before long the
tears were falling from his own eyes again and the two of them stood
together and cried.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Ginny
sat, tangled together under a beech tree by the side of the lake.
Harry had told her, haltingly, when she insisted, about Fred's
death and held her as she cried, his own grief dripping tears that
mingled with her own.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think
it's wrong," whispered Ginny, "that when I saw Fred I felt …
sad, unbelievable sadness and grief but that when I saw Hagrid with –
with you it was like someone had completely ripped out my heart?"
Harry swallowed the lump that had risen in his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't
know, Ginny. I don't think there is a right way to express grief,"
Harry said caressing her face and wiping away the tears.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was
terrifying," she whispered. "And it hurt so much." Harry
watched her struggle not to cry and pulled her to him. She buried her
face in his chest and clung to him and not for the first time that
afternoon Harry bent his head to kiss her. Ginny's fingers dug into
his shoulders and a sob escaped her throat as he tilted her face up
and covered her lips with his own. She responded to his kiss
frantically, desperately. He pulled away breathlessly, watching her
take the same gasping breaths he was as she tried to control her
grief. Her eyes were closed and there were tear drops clinging to her
eyelashes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry," whispered Harry in between the kisses he trailed
down her neck. His worst fear had been not having Ginny to come back
to. If he had even thought that had come true it would have destroyed
him. He could only imagine the torture Ginny must have felt as she
saw him, apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm so glad
you're not dead," she sobbed, losing control of her emotions. "I
feel like I shouldn't be glad because so many people are dead and
I'm just glad it's them and not you." They held each other
close under the beech tree as the sun moved lower in the sky.</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy needs me
you know," Harry said much later as he stared out across the lake.
"I can't afford to fall apart like I did today. He needs me so
much."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay
that you cried, Harry," Ginny replied. "You can't ignore how
you feel."</p><p class="calibre8">"But I can't
let him down," whispered Harry desperately. "Who will tell him
that they love him and about his parents and be there for him?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We all will,
Harry," reassured Ginny. "And he's got his grandmother. He
won't be alone." Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know all
that's important, but he needs ime/i," he
fiercely. "No one else knows what it is like … except maybe
Neville." Harry closed his eyes as tears he didn't think he had
left threatened to fall again.</p><p class="calibre8">"But that
doesn't mean you can't cry Harry," Ginny said softly as she
stroked his arm. "Being there for him doesn't mean you have to be
… stoic. It just means you have to be there." They sat in silence
for a few moments.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm going to
buy him his first broomstick," said Harry eventually. "Sirius
bought me my first broomstick, did you know that?" He searched the
pouch around his neck and pulled out the torn photograph of himself
as a baby.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh you were so
cute," exclaimed Ginny. Harry shook his head in mild amusement.</p><p class="calibre8">"He taught me
to ride it too," he said, "before he wasn't there anymore;
before he couldn't buy me any more broomsticks. I have to be there
for Teddy." His voice broke; thinking about the Firebolt Sirius had
bought him when he was thirteen, the one that made up for twelve
years of Christmas and birthday presents. Ginny looked up from the
photograph, understanding dawning in her eyes. She reached out a hand
to stroke his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are
nothing like Sirius, Harry."</p><p class="calibre8">"I am, I'm
impulsive and reckless and I do things without thinking-"</p><p class="calibre8">"You are going
to be there for Teddy," she interrupted firmly. "We all will.
He'll have so much love he won't know what to do with it."
There were tears sliding down her cheeks and Harry wiped them away
with trembling fingers.</p><p class="calibre8">"I want him to
know how much they loved him," he whispered. "That they died to
protect him; all that stuff I never knew when I was little. I want
him to have a happy childhood." It struck him anew that not only
had he been denied his magical heritage and treated rather poorly, to
put it mildly, for ten years but that any remaining vestiges of his
childhood had fled by the end of his first year at Hogwarts. If he
tried he could catch flashes of it here and there but they were
transparent, ethereal and too hard to grasp.</p><p class="calibre8">As the sun began
to set Harry was exhausted and spent of his energy, too tired to move
from under the beech tree. Too tired to wonder if Ron had told George
anything; too tired to go back inside to eat. Yet he felt strangely
lighter than he had been that morning.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,"
he whispered because talking seemed too loud in the still, quiet
peace of the Hogwarts grounds. "Thank you for listening, for being
here. I couldn't do this without you, Ginny. I don't want to do
this without you. It's been agony to be away from you, not knowing
how you are, hearing only snippets of what's happening to you. I
don't want to be away from you again. I couldn't bear it."
Ginny nodded and reached a hand up to cup his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," she
said. "It's been awful." She leaned in to kiss him soundly and
not for the first time since they'd taken a seat under that tree
did they lose themselves in a searing kiss filled with promises and
passion and yearning. And that's why Harry didn't see Charlie
approaching or hear Ron grumbling about being late to the evening
meal because parents wanted them to locate errant siblings. That's
why Ginny didn't realise Bill and Percy were calling her name.</p><p class="calibre8">And why Harry and
Ginny sprang apart suddenly when George, apparently from quite
nearby, groaned dramatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no! This
cannot be happening," he cried. "I cannot be seeing what I think
I am seeing, no wonder she never told us anything! Such rich
opportunities for taking the mickey; completely wasted!" Ginny
glared up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What on earth
is that supposed to mean?" she demanded. Harry decided to keep very
still and very quiet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, we –
I," George faltered. "I – I can't give you a serve now.
Before he saved the world, yeah we could have completely taken the
mickey out of you, trussed him up and put him in enclosed spaces. But
not now! Now, now I have to all but ignore the fact that ickle
Ginny's got a bloke dangling from her little finger and wrapped
around it! How do I possibly mock and intimidate him now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, because
mum would have made that possible before," said Ron. "At least
you lot haven't had to put up with it, and the mooning and the
sighing. He has been mooning and sighing for a <em class="calibre9">year</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"She's been
moping," retorted Charlie. "Moping and slouching from one room to
the next." Harry was alternating between sinking through the earth
in embarrassment and wonderment that his punishment at the hands for
Ginny's brothers, protectors of her virtue, had not been more
severe.</p><p class="calibre8">"You wouldn't
do anything to Harry!" scoffed Ginny. "I think sometimes you lot
think more of him than you do of me!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Ginny, that
is not true!" Bill looked stunned. Ginny stuck out her bottom lip.
It quivered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginevra,"
Percy began pompously. "Really, I think that is taking things
rather far. I should say that it's not a competition as to who
should receive affection; after all as a parent can love more than
one child equally, so too can sibling love be equally as
distributed." Ginny turned on Percy with big soulful eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh don't
give him that look, Ginny!" George protested. "Of course we don't
love him more than you. You're … you're our favourite sister!
Who's going to go higher than that in our affections? Oh no, don't
you turn those big puppy dog eyes on me!"</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny stared
balefully at George as he squirmed. Harry thought that if this went
on much longer he'd see big fat crocodile tears come leaking out of
those big brown eyes. To keep more still and more quiet he would have
to stop breathing.</p><p class="calibre8">"George, I
think we have to face it, our plans may just have to be scrapped,"
said Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Plans? What
plans? Do you know about these plans?" Ginny turned on Ron, fixing
him with a beady stare reminiscent of Mrs Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't have
any plans," Ron shrugged. "They might have plans. Not me, I have
no plans, no plans at all." Harry snorted, immediately regretting
it as all eyes then turned to him. He figured he may as well go for
broke, having called attention to himself.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, you have
plans alright. I just think they are different plans to the
string-Ginny's-boyfriend-up-by-the-ears plans! Oh yeah, you've
got plans!" chortled Harry. "But I bet none of your plans involve
discussing house elf rights!" The tips of Ron's ears began to
turn red and he growled at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nice try with
the distraction there Harry," said Bill, "but getting back to the
issue at hand –"</p><p class="calibre8">"Issue at
hand?" said Ginny. "What issue can you possibly have?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Absolutely
none Gin. And where's the fun in that?" questioned George. "What
brother in their right mind is going to try and scare off, tease or
otherwise torment your boyfriend when he is actually The Chosen
Saviour of all Wizardkind Who Lived?" Harry rolled his eyes at his
new nickname.</p><p class="calibre8">"You could take
the mickey out of Ron. He kissed Hermione!" he blurted and then
seeing Ron's face as he did so, he got up and ran, Ron chasing
after him, bellowing.</p><p class="calibre8">The others were
laughing as the two of them raced towards the castle doors; Harry
easily ducking Ron's swinging arms. As the two of them reached the
steps Hermione stepped out of the front doors and Harry darted behind
her.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
sneaky, Potter," said Ron, breathing heavily as he rested his hands
on his knees. Harry just grinned at him from behind Hermione while
she huffed at the two of them. The three of them stood there on the
steps for a few minutes as Ron caught his breath before turning to
watch Ginny and his brothers as they ambled up from the lake shore.
As his siblings grew closer Ron reached an arm around Hermione and
gave her a quick kiss on the cheek, looking defiantly back at them.
Harry made a face and gagging sounds and was rewarded with a shove
for his efforts.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny darted
forward and ran squealing to Hermione, and they began whispering and
giggling, apparently completing some sort of female ritual that Harry
was sure he'd never understand. He paid no attention to Ginny's
brothers as they reached the steps, boldly sliding his hands around
Ginny's waist from behind and resting his chin on her shoulder. As
he did so he caught the tail end of the conversation Bill, George,
Charlie and Percy were having.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really, well
mum wouldn't have let us get away with much anyway."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, probably
planning the wedding within a week I reckon."</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
potential for ribbing with young Ron though. He can't do a Bat
Bogey hex."</p><p class="calibre8">"Really if we
were to choose someone for Ginevra ourselves, we couldn't do much
better after all."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry smiled as
Ron tugged Hermione's hand and whined that it was time to eat,
pulling her in the direction of the Great Hall. Bill caught up to
Harry, squeezed his shoulder and nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's go
eat, hey?" He slung an arm around George and led the others inside.
Harry, not quite willing to relinquish his hold on Ginny just yet
stepped awkwardly inside behind her, his arms still around her waist,
his chin resting on her shoulder and breathing in the scent of her
sweet smelling hair.</p>
