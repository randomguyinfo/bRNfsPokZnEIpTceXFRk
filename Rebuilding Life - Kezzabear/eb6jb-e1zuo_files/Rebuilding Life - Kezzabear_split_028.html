<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_29">*Chapter 28*: Chapter 28</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">28.
Fight</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The day did not get
any better for Harry Potter.</p><p class="calibre8">Slughorn assigned
them to work with the person next to them for the next eight weeks.
They had to brew a complicated potion and write a joint essay on the
experience. Harry nearly groaned aloud. Malfoy actually did. When
Potions was finally over Harry had to endure a ranting Hermione who
was livid that she was not permitted to do Muggle Studies.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
what they think they are playing at," she grumbled as she gathered
her books up and shoved them ruthlessly into her bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm going to
find an owl," muttered Ginny. She had a folded parchment in her
hands and stomped out of the classroom before Harry could even say
anything.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen Hermione,
what's wrong with Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Trouble in
paradise Potter?" asked Malfoy sardonically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up Malfoy."</p><p class="calibre8">"I mean, how can
they decide, <em class="calibre9">just like that</em> based on bloodlines who does and
doesn't take a subject?" Hermione continued as if she had not
heard Harry at all. "That's not equality, it's not even
sensible, is it?" She looked up and pierced Malfoy with a glare. He
looked startled at apparently being expected to be on the same side
as Hermione Granger. He regained his equilibrium quickly and his
indifferent sneer fell back into place.</p><p class="calibre8">"I really wouldn't
know," he drawled lazily. "I'm not particularly thrilled at
taking it myself but I have to apparently." Hermione nodded
emphatically, brandishing a quill in his face for emphasis as she
hoisted her bag onto her shoulder. Malfoy took a step back and eyed
Hermione and her quill suspiciously. Hermione appeared about to say
something to Malfoy but perhaps she remembered they were still
enemies because she turned to Harry suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" she
demanded sharply. "How do you feel about having to take Muggle
Studies?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I hadn't
actually given it a lot of thought, Hermione," Harry sighed wearily
as he followed her out of the classroom. "I've been a bit
preoccupied. I need to go and get my bag; I'll see you later."
Harry turned to go up to his dormitory leaving Hermione still railing
about injustices while managing to bring up House Elf rights. Malfoy
was trying to edge away but Hermione kept talking.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry had to do some
smooth talking to convince the Fat Lady to let him into Gryffindor
Tower. He flew up the dormitory stairs, dug his book bag out of his
trunk, gathered together a mess of quills, ink and parchment and
grabbed his text book, '<em class="calibre9">The Magic of Muggles</em>', before
finally racing out of the dormitory and through the common room. The
Fat Lady yelled at him to mind his manners when he slammed the
portrait into the wall on his way out.</p><p class="calibre8">By the time Harry
skidded into the Muggle Studies classroom he was more than ten
minutes late and breathing heavily. Ethel Crockwell was standing in
the middle of the room; a pair of spectacles perched on her head,
dressed in a ridiculous pink cardigan with bobbles on it. For a
moment Harry was reminded horribly of Umbridge. She smiled at him and
beckoned him into the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hurry up then,"
she said. "Now which side of the room are you on?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Pardon?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Which side of the
room, er, Mister …?" The entire class broke out in giggles. Harry
looked at the woman exasperatedly. He wasn't used to having to
introduce himself and while it was a novel idea, he wasn't in the
mood today.</p><p class="calibre8">"Which side is
which, then I can tell you where I belong," he said instead.
Professor Crockwell waved her hand vaguely to the right as she walked
to her desk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pureblood over
there," she said, reaching the desk and picking up a quill and
waving it to the left. "Half-blood over here." Harry just stood
there.</p><p class="calibre8">"I beg your
pardon?"</p><p class="calibre8">"If you're not
sure dear I can find out for you," she said, smiling. "Now, let's
mark you off the roll."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I'm
half-blood," Harry spat. "But why are we being separated into
pure and half-blood?"</p><p class="calibre8">"So I can see how
much you know dear," the professor said patiently. "Now can I
please mark you off the roll?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, you may not,"
said Harry in carefully measured tones. What Gilbert had been saying
finally fell into place. "I am in this class because I am a
half-blood, correct?" Professor Crockwell nodded slowly. It was
evident she was not sure exactly what to make of this defiant young
man.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," she said,
drawing herself up into lecture mode. "Anyone who is not a
Muggleborn is required to take this class to make up for the filthy
untruths spread by that ghastly Ministry last year. I'm not sure
how much you understood of the fuss at the Ministry what with
<em class="calibre9">You-Know-Who</em> and all last year, dear, but it was nasty
business, nasty business indeed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Quite," Harry
muttered dryly as the class burst into a fresh round of giggles.
Harry caught sight of Draco Malfoy simply staring at the woman in
horror.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now I really do
need to find my glasses," she muttered. "Haven't had them all
morning, been quite the ordeal. Has anybody seen them?" As soon as
Susan Bones pointed them out to her, Professor Crockwell shook her
head and plucked them from their perch. She began polishing them
vigorously on the hem of her cardigan. Harry remained standing
defiantly in the middle of the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really young man,
if you could just take a seat please, so we may continue …"
Professor Crockwell trailed off as she adjusted her glasses on her
nose and looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"And why do you
think our bloodline has anything to do with how much we know about
Muggles?" was all Harry said as Professor Crockwell stood there
speechless. "I understand plenty about the nasty business at the
Ministry last year, Professor, and I'm beginning to wonder if we
even learned anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well we need to
start somewhere Mr P-Potter," said Professor Crockwell rather
weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wouldn't it be
best to get to know each of us individually then?" Harry
challenged. "And shouldn't Muggleborn students be in here too?
They have a perspective you can rarely get from children who grew up
in wizarding families."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well it was
a little hard to-"</p><p class="calibre8">"There really
aren't that many Muggleborns," said Harry harshly. "Somehow
that segment of the population has diminished lately." The class
had stopped giggling and were watching Harry nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Board only
approved-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing has
changed," said Harry coldly. "You're still dividing people up
based on their bloodlines!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You have to
admit, Mr Potter, that those who know <em class="calibre9">nothing</em> about Muggles
will be pureblood and half-bloods will have only a few antiquated
ideas," the professor seemed to have recovered her composure and
was trying to get her class back on track.</p><p class="calibre8">"And you, I
suppose, are the <em class="calibre9">expert</em>," asked Harry sarcastically.
Professor Crockwell drew herself up to her full height.</p><p class="calibre8">"I have a lot of
experience with Muggles," she said proudly. "In fact I was chosen
for this position because no one else has more understanding of
Muggles except Arthur Weasley and he's a little busy right now."</p><p class="calibre8">"You've just
contradicted yourself, Professor. Arthur Weasley's a pureblood,"
said Harry quietly. "You can't divide us up based on bloodline."
Ethel Crockwell looked flustered.</p><p class="calibre8">"We need to
counter the injustices of the past year," she began weakly,
sounding as if she was reciting a prepared speech.</p><p class="calibre8">"But this is just
perpetuating them," Harry stood his ground, immovable. The woman
sighed, defeated.</p><p class="calibre8">"What would you
like me to do, Mr Potter?" she gazed at him curiously as if unsure
whether to chastise him or let him continue.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well for a start
I think Seamus should go and get Hermione and Dean and Justin,"
said Harry. Seamus got out of his seat without being asked. "Really,
can we not fit three extra students in here?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Four," piped up
a small blonde Ravenclaw who Harry thought must have been in Ginny's
year. "Ashton Grant's Muggleborn."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well go and get
him then," said Harry, motioning to the girl. She leapt out of her
seat and followed Seamus out of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now," said
Harry, "we get to know one another properly. Did you know I grew up
with Muggles and may as well be Muggleborn?" Professor Crockwell
sighed and sat down at her desk.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is so much
more complicated than I thought it would be," she said wearily. "I
wanted to make Charity proud of me and I've just gone and messed it
up." Harry felt momentarily guilty for being so hard on the woman.
She didn't seem to be causing harm intentionally. It was obvious;
however, that no one had yet drawn the conclusions which Harry had.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing is messed
up yet," he said. "But we can't go on like this. We've got to
stop categorising people this way." Professor Crockwell nodded
slowly just as Seamus burst back into the room, Dean and Justin on
his heels.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry mate,
couldn't find Hermione," Seamus said as the three of them filed
into the room. Harry, who had a sneaking suspicion that he might know
where, or rather who Hermione was with, just shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Never mind, she
can make it up in her sleep," he laughed as he followed Dean and
Justin to a seat next to Neville, Luna and two other Gryffindors whom
Harry recognised only vaguely. It was then that Harry noticed Ginny
wasn't in the room. Frowning he scanned the room but saw only Draco
Malfoy looking peeved and several students swinging on their chairs
out of sheer boredom. Professor Crockwell was shuffling pieces of
parchment on her desk as if organising her thoughts when the blonde
Ravenclaw and her classmate wandered back in.</p><p class="calibre8">"If we are all
here then," said Professor Crockwell, "we shall begin. Now we'll
have to adjust the lesson a bit, dears, as I erm… had it set up a
little differently but I am sure we shall all get along just fine."
Harry smiled encouragingly at her and the class began with people
explaining where they came from and the sorts of games they had
played as a child.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry tuned them all
out and set his mind to worrying about where Ginny might be. Halfway
through the class, while Dean and Justin were explaining a
particularly tricky move in football, Harry silently slipped out of
the classroom. He wasn't sure if the teacher saw him go, nor did he
care if she had.</p><p class="calibre8">He strode down the
corridor purposefully, attempting to look as if he was meant to be
exactly where he was. As soon as he came to a secluded alcove he
darted inside and rummaged about in his bag for the Marauders' Map.
Finding it he dropped his bag on the floor and went to get out his
wand but a muffled squawk made him pause.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why did you two
have to pick this alcove to snog in?" he asked exasperatedly,
without turning around.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why did you have
to skulk into it?" hissed Ron. "Why aren't you in class
anyway?" Harry did not answer, merely got out his wand and,
touching it to the parchment he activated the map and cast a <em class="calibre9">Lumos</em>
in order to read it. Ron and Hermione joined him looking over the map
in the darkened alcove.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who are you
looking for?" asked Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," Harry
replied grimly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Again?" growled
Ron. "Where's she gone <em class="calibre9">this</em> time?"</p><p class="calibre8">"If I knew that,
Ron, I wouldn't be looking for her!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhhhhhhh! Keep
your voices down! None of us are supposed to be here!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are they
gonna do, Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I daresay
Professor McGonagall would have something to say about the Head Boy
out of class and in an alcove with the Head Girl and someone who was
supposed to have left the grounds hours ago," replied Hermione
waspishly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Admit it, you're
glad I stayed," Ron said in a low voice. Hermione actually giggled.
Harry, having found Ginny walking back from the Owlery, folded up the
map briskly. As he stepped out of the alcove and made his way down
the corridor he did not think Ron and Hermione realised he was gone.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry met Ginny
ambling back to the castle, her shoulders hunched and her hands
stuffed in her pockets. She only looked slightly startled to see him.
Harry raised his eyebrows at her. She smiled at him but Harry could
tell she was preoccupied.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shouldn't you
be in class?" she asked as he reached her and stood facing her; his
hands in his own pockets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shouldn't you?"
he countered. She shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Had to send a
letter," she replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry, I sent
Liberty out with Gilbert's letter."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's okay. I
used a school owl." There was a long pause. Neither said anything
and neither moved.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you think
we'll get in trouble for skiving Muggle Studies?" asked Ginny
eventually. Harry grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"I doubt the woman
could tell if we were there or not. She's probably almost as batty
as Trelawney," replied Harry with a smile. "Heart's in the
right place. Woeful execution though."</p><p class="calibre8">"What did she do?"
And with that they moved together towards the castle. Harry didn't
even think about it or consciously decide to do it, they just did. He
reached out and entwined his fingers with Ginny's as they walked
back to the castle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you know
she left Muggleborns off the class lists?" Ginny nodded and Harry
continued. "She tried to separate people according to bloodlines
under the mistaken impression that this could tell her how much
people would know."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
ridiculous," huffed Ginny. "Dad knows more about Muggles than
your average wizard. It's got nothing to do with your bloodline."
Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"S'what I told
her," he said as they approached the steps leading to the Entrance
Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you really?"
asked Ginny curiously. Harry shrugged again and grunted in the
affirmative. Ginny laughed. "You made her restructure her class
didn't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe," Harry
mumbled, pushing open the great oak doors.</p><p class="calibre8">"Brilliant!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
brilliant exactly?" Ron was standing in the middle of the Entrance
Hall, his arms crossed over his chest, scowling at his sister.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, not you,
obviously," Ginny retorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are then, are
you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, as a matter
of fact I am," said Ginny, staring at her brother defiantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What on earth is
g-" started Harry, but Ron ignored him and began stalking towards
Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you?" he
questioned her softly, almost menacingly. "Are you brilliant? Or
are you just covering it up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you on
about, Ron?" Ginny sighed wearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone who's
<em class="calibre9">brilliant</em> doesn't take off for Merlin knows where at the
drop of a hat!" bellowed Ron quite suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, what's it
got to do with you anyway?" spat Ginny. Harry noticed Hermione skid
to a stop as she came into the Entrance Hall from the direction of
the Grand Staircase. Her eyes were wide and she gasped as she covered
her mouth with her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everything,
Ginny!" Ron sputtered. "Do you know what it's like to be
fire-called in the middle of the night by your very worried
girlfriend because your bloody sister has gone missing?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, we knew she
was on school grounds-" Hermione supplied but suddenly Ginny made a
vicious hissing sound at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't ask
anyone to call you," she ground out. "I didn't ask for anyone
to do anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"No! You didn't!"
shouted Ron. "And that's half the bloody problem, isn't it?
You're just going to keep it all bottled up inside until you
explode. Have you got any idea what that does to people? You better
bloody well start talking to people Ginny!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I do talk to
people, Ron," argued Ginny. "Just cause I don't talk to <em class="calibre9">you</em>
doesn't mean I don't talk to people."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah and just
which people were you talking to exactly?" asked Ron sarcastically.
"Considering no one knew where you were and I had Hermione calling
me in <em class="calibre9">tears</em> 'cause you'd vanished and Harry was going
mental, both of you missing! I'd say you're not doing a <em class="calibre9">smashing</em>
job of it, are you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Relax, Ron, Harry
found me," sighed Ginny wearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not until he'd
gone half mad with worry!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really, Ron, I'm
fine," protested Harry indignantly. He was ignored by both Weasley
siblings.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you care
at all about the people who care about you?" asked Ron. "Why
would you put them through this?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Your concern for
me is overwhelming, Ron," sad Ginny sarcastically. "So really,
you don't care what sort of trauma <em class="calibre9">I</em> suffer as long as I
don't inflict any worry on your precious friends!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well I'm
not here am I? How am I supposed to know how they are?" asked Ron,
rather too loudly in Harry's opinion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is this about me
or you three?" Ginny asked pointedly, "because if you guys need a
moment I can leave you alone." Harry's head was whirling, trying
to figure precisely what Ron was angry about. He didn't know about
anyone else but <em class="calibre9">he</em> needed a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron, really, I
think you're reading a bit much into it all," interrupted
Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well you're the
one who called me, Hermione," he said without turning around.</p><p class="calibre8">"You didn't have
to come charging through the Floo," said Hermione weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I was supposed
to leave you, worried out of your mind with only <em class="calibre9">Neville</em>
there?" Ron sounded distinctly amused until he turned around to see
Ginny's wand trained on him. Harry didn't even know when she'd
taken it out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you <em class="calibre9">dare</em>
say Neville isn't capable of supporting anyone," Ginny hissed
threateningly. "You always underestimate him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, really and
you'd know would you, Ginny?" Ron said, staring at her wand as if
it were nothing more than an innocuous stick. "Get plenty of
<em class="calibre9">support</em> from Neville last year, did you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, don't be so
ridiculous."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry's safely
out of the way so you grab whatever's going next?"Ron's eyes
were wild and accusing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron," said
Harry warningly, knowing just how close to the bone he was cutting.
He moved to stand between the two of them but Ron just continued his
hurtful accusations.</p><p class="calibre8">"People shouldn't
just <em class="calibre9">move on</em> like that because they are away from someone,"
he threw out. "Where's your Gryffindor loyalty?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, where is your
brain, Ron?" Ginny laughed at him, her wand never wavered. "I
didn't move on from anyone. I'm not the one who's shown <em class="calibre9">that</em>
particular tendency. Maybe you're just worried people are going to
move on from you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it
happens!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's not
happening to you. I think you're delusional!" Ginny said, her
voice quieter now. "If you think for one minute that these guys
don't miss you every minute then you're stupid."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't be
ridiculous," retorted Ron. "Everyone always gets along fine
without Ron. What about Ron, huh? Does he get along fine without
everyone else?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Clearly not, if
this little display is anything to go by," muttered Ginny. "Y'seem
a bit mental to me. Maybe Ron's decided to move on, abandon his
friends before they abandon him!" It was quicker than Harry had
ever seen and he wasn't sure when it happened exactly, but Ron had
his wand out before Harry could blink. Hermione gasped in shock.</p><p class="calibre8">"What the-" But
before he could get a sentence out an orange spell whizzed past
Ginny's left ear and Harry had a strange feeling of deja vu.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you even
think that!" Ron shouted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then why are you
thinking it?" Ginny bellowed back. "Why would you think they
would move on without you? Because that isn't who they are, is it?
It's who <em class="calibre9">you are</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">It happened so
quickly, there was no time to get out his wand. Cursing himself for
not having it out already when standing between two people with their
wands trained on each other, Harry moved to try and block Ron's
spell from Ginny. Harry didn't see the spell she cast in
retaliation.</p><p class="calibre8">In the aftermath of
her hex, Harry stumbled straight into the path of Ron's Leg Locker
Curse. As he fell, Harry caught the edge of Hermione's <em class="calibre9">Petrificus
Totalus</em> which he could only assume was her attempt to create some
order out of the chaos that had erupted.</p><p class="calibre8">With his body frozen
and falling and his hands unable to protect himself, Harry was almost
grateful for the darkness that overtook him when he hit his head on
the cold flagstones of the Entrance Hall as he fell. At least that
oblivion provided him sweet relief from the Bat Bogeys.</p><p class="calibre8">*******************</p><p class="calibre8">A low murmuring
thrummed in the background even as a loud pounding reverberated in
his skull. There was a dull ache behind his eyes that warned him not
to open them. As the pounding gradually slowed and receded Harry
became more aware of his surroundings as new experiences began to
assault his senses.</p><p class="calibre8">His fingers were
resting on something prickly and he could smell the tang of a dozen
different potions on the air. His head lay on a starched pillow and
the bed he was lying on was hard and narrow. The Hospital Wing.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's mouth was
dry and woolly, just a hint of bitterness lingered. He swallowed
reflexively, the dryness making the lump in his throat hard to shift.
Harry titled his head a little and let out an involuntary groan. He
brought his hands up to cradle his head when a brisk voice shrieked
like a siren, making him wince.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah good, you have
rejoined us." Cool hands began to probe his head and Madam Pomfrey
began to fire questions at him. What was his name? What was the date?
Did he know where he was?</p><p class="calibre8">Finally she stopped
her ministrations and Harry cracked an eye open to see what she was
doing. A grim smile plastered on her face, Madam Pomfrey was weaving
her wand in a complex pattern above his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right!" she
proclaimed suddenly. "Drink this!" She thrust a beaker at him and
Harry, startled by how suddenly it had appeared, drank it in one
large gulp. He grimaced at the aftertaste and made a gagging sound.</p><p class="calibre8">There's water on
the bedside table, Potter," said Madam Pomfrey briskly. "Now if
you hurry you can catch most of your double Herbology lesson."</p><p class="calibre8">The throbbing in his
head almost gone, Harry sat fully upright gingerly and straightened
his glasses. Madam Pomfrey turned around.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't want to
see you in my hospital wing again, Mr Potter," she said. "Please
<em class="calibre9">stay out of danger</em>!" Her hands trembled as she gathered up
the potion bottles on his bedside table and Harry got the impression
that the woman had been shaken by seeing him unconscious so early in
the term.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't do it
on purpose," he muttered a little belligerently as he swung his
feet over the edge of the bed. The school nurse only harrumphed.
Harry reached gingerly for his shoes.</p><p class="calibre8">"And you might
send those three outside on their way when you leave."</p><p class="calibre8">"Aren't you
going to try and keep me here?" asked Harry cheekily. Madam Pomfrey
eyed him carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know better
than to try that," she replied. "Not only would you resist such a
course of action, but I think you've proven you're a bit tougher
than a bump on the head. Just come straight back if you start seeing
double." In a sudden and brief show of tenderness the nurse patted
him gently on the knee and Harry caught the tear glistening in her
eye as she turned around. He had a suspicion that Madam Pomfrey had
been more upset by his mishap than she was letting on.</p><p class="calibre8">"Off you go,
Potter," she barked on her way to her office. "Stop
dilly-dallying!" Harry smiled and finished tying his shoes. He
checked his wand was still in his pocket, grabbed his bag and headed
to the door without a second glance. As he pushed the doors open he
discovered the source of the murmuring. Hermione, Neville and Luna
were leaning on the wall outside the Hospital Wing, talking quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not like you to
skive off Herbology, Neville," he said as the doors swung shut
behind him. Neville looked up with a start and Hermione dropped her
bag and threw herself on his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right, Harry?" she asked. "I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't
mean to get you! I was trying to get Ron, the great idiot. I never
meant to hit you at all!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry
about it Hermione," Harry said gently as he disengaged her arms
from the chokehold they had on his neck. "But next time can you
cast a <em class="calibre9">Protego</em> instead?" Hermione blushed profusely.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,"
Harry assured her.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's good,
Harry. We were ever so worried," Luna said. "You really do need
to stay conscious, I think. It scares people when you lay limp and
unmoving on the floor." Harry didn't quite know what to say to
that so he just nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's get to
class," said Neville, breaking the unnerving silence that fell
after Luna spoke. Hermione nodded briskly and Luna turned immediately
in the direction of the greenhouses.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not that I am not
pleased to see you all, but where are Ginny and Ron?" Harry asked
as Hermione gathered her bag and the four of them set off for
Herbology.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I'm not
exactly sure," Hermione said nervously. "Professor McGonagall
sent them both to her office while she levitated you to the Hospital
Wing. We've not seen them since."</p><p class="calibre8">"We followed her,"
added Luna helpfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Madam Pomfrey
wouldn't let us in though," said Hermione quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"McGonagall tried
to get us to leave the Hospital Wing doors," added Neville, "for
about five minutes."</p><p class="calibre8">"But she refused
to answer Hermione's questions about Ronald and Ginevra," said
Luna. "I suspect they have gotten into terrible trouble. Professor
McGonagall was so cross. She was almost purple you know."</p><p class="calibre8">"She was," said
Neville worriedly. "She took twenty points from Ginny for duelling
in the Entrance Hall. She tried to take twenty from Ron as well but
the counters refused to do it so she took them from you instead."
Harry laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not
funny," Hermione scolded. "Ginny's probably got detention for a
week! Ron would have, too, if he was still here. Mrs Weasley will
probably ground him."</p><p class="calibre8">"She can't do
that, he's an adult," protested Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I think
you'll find she can!" retorted Hermione as they pushed open the
door to outside and went down the steps towards greenhouse four. "Why
would you defend him? He tried to hex your girlfriend! He <em class="calibre9">did</em>
hex you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"So did you,
Hermione," pointed out Harry. "So did my girlfriend. Between the
three of you, I think you nearly accomplished something Voldemort
never could manage." Harry laughed as he pushed open the door to
the greenhouse but he was the only one. The rest of the greenhouse
fell silent and Hermione went pale.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
that was very funny, Harry," said Luna matter-of-factly. "You may
want to work on your jokes a little more. Maybe ask Seamus. He tells
good jokes." She floated away to join a fellow Ravenclaw at one of
the tables and Professor Sprout cleared her throat, motioning the
three Gryffindors to a space at one of the tables and continuing her
lecture on Fluttering Fireweed.</p><p class="calibre8">When the lesson was
finally over, more than one person having been scorched by ill timed
repotting, the seventh year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws clattered out
of the greenhouse and back to the castle for lunch. Ginny had never
turned up to Herbology but Professor Sprout was a little more astute
than Professor Crockwell and Harry did not get a chance to sneak out
and find her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where do you
suppose Ginny has been all this time?" asked Neville as they neared
the castle doors. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"McGonagall must
have had something to say," he muttered, shouldering open the door
and stomping inside.</p><p class="calibre8">"Indeed I do, Mr
Potter." Harry looked up, startled to see Professor McGonagall
standing in the corridor as if she had been waiting for him. It was
lunch time and students milled around the corridors, heading for the
Great Hall, catching up with friends they had not seen in the last
period.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm really
sorry about before," started Harry. "I know you told me no
fighting and I know it looks like I was but-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you quite all
right now, Potter?" the Headmistress asked him. Harry nodded.
"Good, I did not fancy facing Molly Weasley's wrath if I had to
Floo and tell her otherwise. Potter, if I might see you for a moment,
in my office?" Harry smiled slightly and nodded. Hermione shifted
anxiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor … er,
where did Ginny go?" she asked, fiddling awkwardly with the strap
on her bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"Miss Weasely,"
said McGonagall softly, and not unkindly, "had some family business
to attend to. She will no doubt be along presently. I trust you are
ready for your class after lunch?" Harry noticed her lips twitch a
little as she said it and he realised that their first Defence class
was after lunch. Neville nodded enthusiastically and Luna gave a
dreamy sort of sigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh I do hope it
is better than last year," she said. "Last year it wasn't very
fun at all. And the teacher was quite unattractive. He just wasn't
a nice person, was he Neville?" She turned her protuberant eyes to
Neville expectantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am sure you
will find your supervisor quite amenable, Miss Lovegood," was all
Professor McGonagall said as she turned with a swish of tartan.
Hermione was still twisting her bag strap worriedly when Professor
McGonagall turned around suddenly. "Miss Granger, when you see him,
please be sure to tell Mr Weasely that should he wish to visit in the
future, the Gryffindor common room fireplace will be available every
second Saturday, starting next week, <em class="calibre9">during daylight hours only</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,
professor," said Hermione weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come along,
Potter," said McGonagall briskly, her abrupt change of tone
startling all four students. "If you hurry along you'll make it
back in time to eat lunch." Harry obediently fell into step behind
her as she moved away.</p><p class="calibre8">Professor McGonagall
said nothing as they made their way up to the gargoyle guarding her
office. There was a dull ache making its presence felt at the base of
Harry's skull and he gingerly touched the back of his head and
winced. Madam Pomfrey had done an excellent job but his scalp was
still tender.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lemon Drop,"
said McGonagall as she reached the gargoyle. She must have sensed
Harry's surprise because she paused before stepping onto the
staircase and said simply. "It gives me strength." Harry nodded
as he followed her up. He could see how that worked.</p><p class="calibre8">Professor McGonagall
pushed open the heavy doors and entered her office, Harry trailing
after her. He stood uncertainly in the middle of the room as the
professor strode to her desk and searched through the parchment on
top. Professor Dumbledore was asleep in his portrait frame, his
painted chest rising and falling evenly. Harry just watched him for a
moment while he waited for Professor McGonagall to reveal why she had
asked him here.</p><p class="calibre8">"He still sleeps a
lot lately," McGonagall said quietly a moment later. Harry hadn't
noticed her stop searching her desk and come to stand by him. She had
a scroll of parchment in her hands and gazed up at the portrait with
him. "Still, it's comforting to have him here. They all give good
advice to a greenhorn like me." She waved vaguely around at the
circular room. Harry noticed that the all the former headmasters and
headmistresses were watching him. He gave a self conscious little
wave.</p><p class="calibre8">"That must be why
they are here," said Harry thoughtfully. "Remember when Umbridge
couldn't get in? She obviously wasn't seen as a real
Headmistress, so the castle wouldn't let her in, give her access to
this office." He stopped suddenly, his brow furrowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You may be right,
Potter," Professor McGonagall nodded. "Only a true Head can
access the combined wisdoms contained in this room."</p><p class="calibre8">"So," said Harry
thoughtfully. "If only true Heads can even get in here, then they
earn the right to have a portrait up there." He gestured to the
walls above his head vaguely. McGonagall nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're all up
there," she said.</p><p class="calibre8">"No they aren't,"
said Harry softly. "Snape's not there." Professor McGonagall
looked startled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Snape?" she
asked, her nose wrinkling a little. "I wouldn't have thought-"</p><p class="calibre8">"He had access to
this office didn't he?" asked Harry. "He belongs up there."
Harry shifted uncomfortably under his professor's gaze as she eyed
him closely.</p><p class="calibre8">"You and Severus
never got along, Potter," she said eventually.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know."</p><p class="calibre8">"I confess I did
not expect you to react to Severus the way you have recently,"
McGonagall said quietly as they both contemplated Dumbledore's
sleeping form. "You've grown up, Potter. You've really grown
up."</p><p class="calibre8">"I tried to fight
it, I promise," said Harry, grinning. Professor McGonagall smiled
at him fondly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sure you
still have a few boyish tricks up your sleeve," she said and Harry
thought he caught a twinkle in her eye but it vanished in an instant.
"Do try not to get caught." Harry stifled a smirk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Should be easier
this year, Professor," he said solemnly. "Snape's not lurking
around every corner trying to catch me out of bed." He thought he
caught her smile before her mask was back in place and her lips
pressed firmly together in a thin, disapproving line.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do be wary of
Professor Fiesche," she said suddenly. Harry looked at her in
confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The Defence
professor," she said and the way her mouth twisted betrayed her
feelings for the man. "Despite his own ridiculous constraints, he's
a little … put out that he isn't teaching seventh year Defence. I
can't quite put my finger on it …" Harry sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why is it always
about the Defence professor?" he whined. Professor McGonagall
chuckled slightly before handing him the scroll in her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your class list,"
she said kindly. "Just mark the red tape … er roll, and make sure
they don't destroy the classroom." Harry took the scroll from her
carefully as if it might explode.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good Luck,
Harry," came a familiar voice from the wall. Harry looked up to see
Professor Dumbledore's portrait had woken and was smiling at him,
his blue eyes twinkling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
Professor," he said and he knew that Dumbledore and McGonagall knew
he meant both of them. Professor McGonagall patted him on the
shoulder before she walked briskly back to her desk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Off to lunch
then, Potter," she said. "I'm sure you have the means to find
Miss Weasley on your way back to the Great Hall." She sat down and
busied herself with paperwork. Harry took this as his dismissal and
waved to Dumbldore's portrait before slipping out of the room. He
had unfolded the map and located Ginny before the staircase spilled
him back out into the corridor. He was surprised to find Ron with her
but not surprised to find out that they were outside the Hospital
Wing.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry ambled along
the corridor to the Hospital Wing. He spotted Ron and Ginny, huddled
together on the floor, opposite the door. Any thought he had of
sneaking up on them was erased when he saw how pale Ginny was as she
sat with her arm around Ron, whose shoulders were shaking violently.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron was crying. Ron
almost never cried. Ron got angry. Harry's steps faltered and he
stood several feet away, unsure what to do. Ginny's soft voice
floated to him in the stillness.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry Ron,"
she said. "I didn't mean to make you worry." Ron sniffed and
raised his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, you've
said. Stop apologising," he said, a wan smile on his face. "I'm
pathetic." He scrubbed a hand over his face and Ginny smiled
slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you're
not going to get any argument from me about that," she said
solemnly. She sounded serious but Harry knew she wasn't.</p><p class="calibre8">"I hate being away
from them," Ron said in a small voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was less than
a day," Ginny sounded amused but Ron turned a solemn face to look
at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did Harry tell
you I ran out on them, last year, before Christmas?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Ginny
shook her head slowly. "But Bill did. I knew he was hiding
something. I made him tell me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Stupidest thing I
ever did," muttered Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a tough
contest," Ginny deadpanned and received a shove to her shoulder.
They were silent for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"George came home
drunk last night," Ron said eventually, tracing a pattern on the
worn flagstones of the corridor with one index finger. "He wasn't
late, just drunk. Something went wrong on this date he had. He's
going out with a different witch every night." Ginny sat quietly,
waiting for her brother to continue. Harry saw her hands shake as she
plucked at an invisible piece of dirt on her robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not the
way to deal with it," she said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ron
tilted his head back to rest on the wall behind him. "Mum pretends
it's not happening. He staggered in last night and knocked over
four chairs before vomiting into the fireplace and she just offered
him a hot chocolate. She didn't even clean up his spew. George just
started crying and then she dropped the whole jug of milk so Dad took
her up to bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"There I am,
sitting in my mother's kitchen, trying to find a Sobering Charm in
one of her books while my brother sobs brokenly all over the kitchen
table. It's not how I imagined being eighteen and finished with
school would be like. I just wished I'd come back to school
instead, right at that moment; someone to tell me what to do, rules,
regulations. I thought I'd be hanging out with Hermione between
going to Auror training with Harry. I should be conning Fred and
George into giving me free Wheezes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Instead I'm
making sure George doesn't go insane with loneliness and that the
shop stays open. He has more down days than you all know. He hides it
from everyone except me. I think he's trying to protect everyone.
I've never seen him so drunk, though. Before … I've always
dragged him quietly to bed; he just falls asleep. I've never needed
a Sobering Charm before. Flitwick doesn't teach you those at
Hogwarts. I'm surprised I didn't <em class="calibre9">Obliviate</em> him really;
although maybe he'd prefer that."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think sometimes
we all would," sighed Ginny. "But then we wouldn't even
remember Fred. I think that'd be worse. I was talking to Mrs
Granger last week. She said that last year they always felt like they
were missing something and never could quite figure out what it was."</p><p class="calibre8">"He kept crying,
after he was sober," continued Ron. "I dunno, I thought he was …
over it. Not over Fred's death, I don't think he's ever going
to get over that. But over the crying thing; he's had a good week,
things were looking up. He must have just been bottling things up."
Ron sighed and ran his hands through his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"What set him
off?" asked Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Angelina,"
replied Ron, shifting to stare fixedly at the Hospital Wing doors.
Ginny looked at him questioningly. Ron didn't reply for a moment,
staring at the doors. Eventually he spoke. "He ran into Angelina
while he was out with Bridget … or Bridie … might have been
Beatrice. She broke up with Lee. I don't know if George was cursing
her for betraying Fred's memory or something – or for breaking
Lee's heart. It was hard to tell." Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred told me at
Auntie Muriel's that they were on a break again," she supplied.
"I think she was seeing Lee since Easter."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I did get
out of George that he ditched this Bonnie person and he and Angelina
spent a couple hours drowning half a million sorrows at The Hogs
Head. We were in the kitchen for ages; took me an hour to find a
Sobering Charm and another half hour to make it work. Then he just
started talking, and talking and talking. He kept wailing something
about never getting over Fred and missed chances or something, I
don't know. He passed out right about the time Hermione Floo'ed
me in tears saying you were missing and Harry had gone after you and
not come back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just … I
dunno, I couldn't even think straight anymore. She told me she was
fine, Neville was keeping her company and you'd probably both be
back soon. I couldn't bear it. Mum was ignoring what was going on
right under her nose and now Hermione's telling me 'it'll all
be fine'. I had all these visions of you losing it like George
'cause you've been bottling things up. I don't even know what I
was thinking. I just felt so helpless.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione was
crying and I was angry at you for making her cry and angry at myself
because I couldn't be there for her. And I was jealous of Neville
because he was there for her, worried about Harry because he would do
anything for you and instead of telling him what was wrong you just
ran off. He's been through so much and I just want him to be happy,
you know, not worrying about someone every minute.</p><p class="calibre8">"And it was just
like second year when you didn't tell anyone, Ginny. What about if
it was too late by the time you asked for help? You were going to
turn out just like George – an utter mess. He's a mess, Ginny. It
breaks my heart. I was so angry at you because I can't worry about
more than one of you at a time. I just … I'm lost. They're my
best friends and without them it's … imagine how George feels. He
can't even Floo through to Fred in the middle of the night and set
off all the alarms in the Headmistresses' office."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is that what
happened?' asked Ginny quietly. Ron nodded, drawing his knees up to
his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, Snape
alarmed all the entry points into the castle last year, like Floos
and whatnot," he said. "I didn't know. I was standing on the
hearthrug arguing with Hermione when she just breezed in and it was
like she didn't even bat an eyelid. 'In my office, now, Mr
Weasley' she says. 'And you two; follow me.' She didn't even
ask what I was doing there or even look surprised!" Ginny laughed
softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I guess almost
nothing startles her now, she's been teaching so long."</p><p class="calibre8">"When we got to
her office she asked what I was doing there and what Hermione and
Neville were doing out of bed," Ron added. "Neville said
something about getting up early to study but I don't think
McGonagall believed him. I mean classes hadn't even started. Not
even Hermione's ever been that keen, let alone Neville."</p><p class="calibre8">"Did she know
Harry and I were missing?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Ron shook
his head. "Hermione told her we'd set up a secret meeting but you
could tell she didn't believe her either. She just gave the three
of us a lecture. It was pretty mild. Then she told me I should stay
and settle my mind and that you, being a Weasley, would be down to
breakfast. She'd have the House Elves set another place. She knew
why I was there. I think she assumed you were in bed though."</p><p class="calibre8">"You knew where we
were though," said Ginny suddenly. "How did you do that? Can you
see through Invisibility Cloaks?" Ron laughed, loudly this time.</p><p class="calibre8">"I could see your
feet!" he chortled. Ginny shook her head. Ron continued to laugh
helplessly, slightly hysterically Harry thought. He felt a bit guilty
for eavesdropping and wondered how he could make his presence known
without scaring them both. Ron continued to laugh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have you had any
sleep?" Ginny asked him shrewdly. Ron shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Got about an hour
on the common room couch," he said ruefully. "Some
Puddlemere-worshipping git is in my bed."</p><p class="calibre8">"Donald Smythe,"
supplied Ginny helpfully. "Most prized possession; Oliver Wood's
signature, best friend; Felix R Josephs – don't forget the R."
Ron grunted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seamus and Dean
woke me up by jumping on me," he added. "We decided to let Harry
sleep. I think we all know what time you came in last night. Were you
two up all night?" Ginny blushed a little.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, we were in
Hagrid's cabin with Dora," she admitted. "We fell asleep."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is that what you
young people call it these days," said Ron, affecting the shuddery
speech of an old man. Ginny nudged him with her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up, we
really did!" Ron just grinned at her before sobering slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He deserves to be
happy, Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," his
sister replied. "He is … apart from the whole hexing him thing …"
She trailed off and Harry saw a grimace pass over both their faces.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's going to
be all right isn't he?" Ginny asked plaintively and Ron folded
his lanky arms around his sister.</p><p class="calibre8">"He'll be fine,"
he said softly. "Always is; takes a bit more than a stray hex or
three to take out Harry Potter." Ron and Ginny didn't hear
Harry's footsteps as he approached.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
we hexed him …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
Hermione didn't use Protego," Ron shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's what I
told her," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny's reaction
was immediate. Before Harry had time to blink she'd scrambled to
her feet and thrown herself at him. Harry winced as she threw her
arms around his neck and accidentally thumped him in the back of the
head where it was still tender.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're all
right, you're all right," she kept repeating.</p><p class="calibre8">"I will be if you
stop hitting my head," Harry grumbled good-naturedly as she knocked
his ear trying to squeeze him tighter. Ginny pulled away, mumbling an
apology which Harry swiftly cut off with a kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop that," Ron
groaned. He too had risen to his feet and was standing awkwardly, his
hands in his pockets. Harry just grinned at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm so sorry,
Harry," Ginny said. "I didn't mean to hex you, I was aiming for
Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">"And I was aiming
for her," Ron added sheepishly. "You sure you're all right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Madam Pomfrey let
me go about an hour ago," Harry replied, nodding. He looked from
Ron to Ginny. "I guess you two have been sorting out your
differences properly, then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, we have,"
answered Ginny softly. "Ron was a bit worried about us and under a
bit of pressure at home, that's all."</p><p class="calibre8">"I heard," Harry
said softly. Ron shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll get by,"
he said, scuffing at the floor with his foot. "I'm really sorry,
mate." Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd think I'd
know better by now that to stand in between the two of you with your
wands drawn," he laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably not the
smartest thing you've ever done," agreed Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, you're not
here to beat me to a pulp for staying out all night with your
sister?" queried Harry, gesturing that they should go. He scooped
up Ginny's bag and slung it over his shoulder with his own. With
his other hand he reached out and entwined his fingers with hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah," said Ron,
"I'm hoping you won me the bet." He grinned cheekily at them
and Harry turned a violent shade of red.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron!" protested
Ginny sharply.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
how you all think you'll even be able to know who wins this bet,"
said Harry conversationally, his embarrassment receding. "Do you
expect me to waltz up to you lot and let you know at which point I
deflowered your sister?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" Ginny
stared at him incredulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"We planned to get
you pissed," grinned Ron. Ginny just shook her head. She started to
pull away from Harry; her cheeks stained a brilliant red. Harry
pulled her back to him, winding his free arm around her waist and
stopping in the middle of the corridor.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
he whispered, pressing a kiss to her head. "We shouldn't joke
about it." Ginny nodded into his chest where she'd buried her
face. Ron cleared his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"I might just go
find Hermione, say goodbye," he said. "I'll see you guys next
Hogsmeade weekend." Harry remembered what Professor McGonagall had
said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Might be sooner,
Hermione's got a surprise for you," he said, smiling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Take care of
yourself Ron," said Ginny suddenly, lifting her head. Ron nodded
and then surprised Harry by stepping forward swiftly and embracing
them both for a brief moment before he pulled away and quickly jogged
off down the corridor in the direction of the Great Hall.</p>
