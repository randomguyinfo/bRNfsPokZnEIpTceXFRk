<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_14">*Chapter 13*: Chapter 13</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Christening</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Weasley flew at them engulfing them one after the other in rib
cracking hugs, sobbing loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
you're safe, you're alright," she wailed. "You are all right
aren't you? All of you?" Harry nodded dumbly, gazing in horror at
The Burrow's kitchen. The floor was strewn with broken crockery.
Cutlery was thrown haphazardly around the room and the chairs and
table were overturned. Three Aurors roamed the room making notes and
taking pictures.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
the bloody hell happened here?" demanded Ron. Charlie and Percy
were standing in the doorway to the hallway and both of them
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Was
like this when we all got home," said Charlie. Harry noticed Ginny
was pale and shaking and he put his arms around her instinctively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
George?" asked Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dunno,"
answered Charlie. "We were hoping he was with you lot." Mrs
Weasley was staring anxiously out of the kitchen window as if that
could make George appear. Mr Weasley came in the back door just then
and proclaimed that all wards were intact and given the lack of
damage to any of the outside doors they must have come through the
Floo during the Ceremony.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
finished here now Mrs Weasley," said one of the Aurors. "Bad luck
Arthur, hope there's nothing missing, they don't appear to have
gone upstairs at all. You should be right to fix this up now. We'll
be fixing the security on the other end of the Floo as soon as we go
back through." The Aurors left through the Floo and Mrs Weasley
picked up a chair and sank into it with a heavy sigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
happened, dad?" asked Ron again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Death
Eaters," grimaced Mr Weasley. Harry blanched and Hermione gasped.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"
barked Ron. "I thought we got rid of all those tosspots!"</p><p class="calibre8">"They
have been mostly captured in the last three weeks but there are a
couple still on the run," explained Mr Weasley. "They wanted to
leave a warning." He thrust a sheet of Parchment at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bloody
hell," whispered Ron, his face going white. Harry reached over and
snatched it from Ron's grasp and promptly leaned over and retched
when he saw what was written on the parchment.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">We'll
get the rest of your brats, Weasley, and then we go after Potter.</em></p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
and Ginny helped Harry into a chair while Ron cleaned up the vomit.
Harry was shaking violently, Ginny not faring much better and Mrs
Weasley was beginning to rock back and forth muttering about George
and wringing her hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Charlie,
go and look for George. Percy, you go and fetch Bill. This is more
important than forgotten silencing charms," ordered Mr Weasley
quietly. They both nodded and hurried off, Ron in pursuit of Charlie.
Hermione made tea that no one drank and Mr Weasley began setting the
kitchen to rights while they waited for the boys to return.</p><p class="calibre8">**********************</p><p class="calibre8">"How
can this happen?" whispered Harry after what seemed like hours.
Bill and Fleur had returned and Fleur had made something to eat but
no one had much of an appetite. George, Ron and Charlie had still not
returned or sent any word and darkness was falling.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
supposed to be gone," said Hermione quietly. "I can't believe
everything we've gone through to still be faced with this." The
happiness Harry had felt that morning was easily dissipated. It
almost felt as if Dementor had swept in and was hovering over them.
Harry hadn't eaten a bite and he felt so cold. He began shivering,
heedless of the concerned looks that Bill threw his way.</p><p class="calibre8">Suddenly
there was a commotion at the door. It burst open to reveal three red
headed men, the two on the outside supporting the one in the middle.
Ron and Charlie dragged George into the room between them. All three
of them were covered in blood, but George appeared to be unconscious.</p><p class="calibre8">"Him
and Lee together with Neville, Dean and Seamus took <em class="calibre9">Dennis
Creevey </em>out for some Firewhisky,"
Charlie puffed as he hefted George through to the living room. "I
have no <em class="calibre9">idea</em>
what they could possibly have been thinking. Nutters the lot of them.
And as for Aberforth, he's not blameless in this either!" He and
Ron dropped George on the couch and Mrs Weasley flew over.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
just superficial mum, he's not bleeding much," said Ron. "He
got knocked out though, tripped over a tree root, the silly git. I
could use a few healing spells here though." Ron exposed his arm, a
deep cut ran the length of it and Mrs Weasley and Hermione cried out
in alarm.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
in the blazes <em class="calibre9">happened</em>
to you!" bellowed Mr Weasley. "You've been gone for hours, you
send no word and you turn up bleeding with George unconscious! Where
on earth have you been and what have you been up to?" George began
to stir. Mrs Weasley and Hermione tended to Ron's wounds, and
George, as he came around, while Charlie explained what had happened.</p><p class="calibre8">He
and Ron went back to the Ministry and found the place in an uproar.
Two Death Eaters had apparently Flooed back in and tried to blast
their way out of the still crowded Atrium. One had been captured but
the other escaped. Tracking down Cho, the last remaining DA member in
the Banquet Room, they found out where George and the others had
gone. Unfortunately Cho had already given that information to a
mysterious stranger.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
been more trouble than she's worth, that one!" exclaimed Ron.
Ginny growled. "Honestly you'd think she could tell what a Death
Eater looked like by now. Well, we hot footed it to Hogsmeade of
course, found The Hogs Head full of spell fire. If that lot hadn't
been drunk they could have fought off our old friend but he'd
pinned them behind the bar the dozy gits."</p><p class="calibre8">"Wasn't
expecting Ron though," said Charlie, pride in his voice, "took
him down with one hex, sent him flying through the window!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
had the unfortunate effect of sending a piece of flying glass at me
though," winced Ron as Hermione continued to clean his wound.
"Aberforth thought it would be a good idea to charm the windows so
that if someone goes flying out of one, all the glass comes flying
straight back inside and reforms back into the frame. You stand too
close to one when you send someone flying through it and manage to
get in the way of reforming glass and you end up like this."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you're all okay then? Nobody got hurt apart from that?" demanded
Mrs Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
the blood on me is all Ron's and George here is banged up only
because he was too drunk to walk straight and as we tried to get him
home he lurched off into the Forest and fell over," explained
Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Aurors came and took away the Death Eater. They interrogated the
other one and turns out they were the ones here. Kingsley reckons
they are both a bit deranged," said Ron. "Says there's no more
Death Eaters out there either. They were the last two known ones.
Trials start now though."</p><p class="calibre8">"We
had to Apparate Dean, Seamus and Dennis home and deal with their very
irate mothers," Charlie continued. "Angelina's got a bigger
temper than Lee's mum." He shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Angelina?"
asked Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
apparently they are an 'item' now. She's not a fan of drunk
Lee," Charlie confessed. "By the time we finished all that,
George here had drunk Aberforth under the table."</p><p class="calibre8">The
family sat there in silence while Mrs Weasley dotted dittany on the
scrapes on George's face and Hermione bandaged Ron's arm to
protect the new skin that was forming over his cut. Harry closed his
eyes and let out a deep breath as Charlie and Ron finished their
stories.</p><p class="calibre8">He
snapped his eyes back open as the flashes of green returned and the
glowing red eyes leered at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you all right, Harry?" asked Ginny softly. Wordlessly Harry nodded,
avoiding Bill's gaze. Mrs Weasley chivvied them off to bed only
moments later and while Ron fell asleep immediately his head hit the
pillow, Harry sat huddled against the wall by his bed, staring into
the darkness far too afraid to close his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">Panting
and soaked with sweat, Harry shot upright in bed, the sheet tangled
around his legs. He thrashed about, the feeling of being trapped was
pressing down on him and he leaned over the side of the bed as that
very thought made him violently ill. A hand was rubbing his back and
a soft voice whispering something to him; a cool flannel was pressed
to his forehead and a glass of water thrust into his shaking hands.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked up into Bill's concerned face as he gulped the water down.
Bill vanished the vomit from the floor and took the glass, setting it
on the windowsill. Harry let the tears slip from his eyes and slide
down his cheeks as Bill gathered him in a hug to rival one of Mrs
Weasley's. Harry didn't care that it was Bill; that he was crying
on another man's shoulder. He thought vaguely that it should feel a
bit weird but it didn't.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
told you to tell us, kid," Bill was whispering. "If you're
feeling bad, tell us, we can help." Harry sniffed and pulled
himself off Bill, sitting upright in the bed.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
did you know? Was I screaming out or something?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No.
I saw you, downstairs, and I knew that something was bothering you,"
replied Bill. "I could tell so I came and sat with you because you
lied. You told Ginny you were all right. I knew you weren't, she
knew you weren't. The only reason I'm here and not her is because
I sent her to bed half an hour ago." Harry let out a shuddering
sigh. His nightmares were back and he was too afraid to sleep. He
thought the nightmares were behind him but clearly they weren't.</p><p class="calibre8">Bill
pressed a Dreamless Sleep Potion into his hands. Harry drank it and
sank back onto his pillow as Bill pulled the covers up around his
shoulders and stroked his hair until he fell asleep.</p><p class="calibre8">**********************</p><p class="calibre8">It
was a very pale Harry who made his way down the stairs for breakfast
the next morning. Despite the Dreamless Sleep Potion he hadn't
actually slept much after staying awake half the night to avoid
nightmares. Dark smudges sat under his eyes and his feet felt heavy
as he plodded down the stairs. Mrs Weasley inspected him carefully,
feeling his forehead and peering into his eyes before pushing him
into a seat and giving him a heaped pile of bacon and eggs. He felt
numb and more than a little bit detatched.</p><p class="calibre8">And
then Ginny was there. He watched as she twirled into the room, her
hair flying as she danced away from Charlie and his teasing. He
watched her as she greeted her mother good morning with a kiss and
settled herself next to him and her kiss on his cheek seemed to break
the silence and thaw his soul. The kitchen came back to life and time
began again. Harry reached for her and held onto her as the dam broke
again and he cried. He had absolutely no idea why he was crying he
thought he'd moved beyond that now. He'd buried the dead and
sorted things out – he found the happiness – so he had no idea
what was happening now.</p><p class="calibre8">But
nobody moved to accuse him of not holding it together, to tease him
or mock him. Ginny simply held him as he cried and when he finished
Charlie handed him a clean handkerchief and Mrs Weasley gave him a
fresh plate of piping hot eggs and bacon and patted him on the cheek.
He spent the day sitting in the living room with Ginny, talking
quietly or dozing, his head in her lap.</p><p class="calibre8">The
following days passed in a similar fashion. He would fight nightmares
at night, eat breakfast in the mornings and then spend the day
quietly with Ginny. Sometimes Ron and Hermione would join them and
Harry played chess with Ron. Once they all went swimming with George
down at the pond and Harry even laughed as they splashed about. Mrs
Weasley spent her days making his favourite foods and doing his
washing. Mr Weasley brought him Muggle appliances and pieces of the
flying motorcycle and asked him to explain what they were for (he
never did quite manage to convince Mr Weasley that a CD could store
music) and Bill and Fleur stayed until Harry's nightmares stopped.</p><p class="calibre8">Percy
kept them all updated on the trials that were held daily at the
Ministry. The day he brought home the news that Dolores Umbridge had
been imprisoned for her crimes against Muggleborns George declared it
Justice Day and that night set off a series of Red and Gold fireworks
over Fred's grave.</p><p class="calibre8">The
day Percy told them that the Malfoys had weaseled their way out of
Azkaban by proving collusion with Harry at the end of the battle
George declared it Ponce Day and spent the night in his room devising
a new series of confectionery that he sent to Malfoy Manor and
refused to tell anyone what they would do. Rumour had it that Draco
and his father spent a good three weeks in St Mungos but it was
largely unconfirmed.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
sent a statement about Narcissa's actions at Kingsley's request
and the Wizengamot called Hagrid in to testify as the only alive and
non incarcerated witness to Harry's 'death'. Fleur expressed,
loudly, the opinion that Hagrid had bollixed it up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey
Hagrid's all right!" Ron protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
it isn't his fault," Harry said staunchly, glaring at Fleur.</p><p class="calibre8">"Anyway,
<em class="calibre9">Harry</em> sent
the statement about Mrs Malfoy," Ron said. He turned to Harry.
"What was in your statement anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Look,
she saved my life in the end," Harry said wearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
how'd it get off her little Death Eater family?" Ron asked
angrily. "What'd you put in it to let that happen?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing!"
Harry exclaimed indignantly. "I didn't do it to get Lucius Malfoy
off of anything!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Same
effect though," grumbled Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't control all the little things Lucius Malfoy takes advantage
of, Ron," argued Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you agree he took advantage of <em class="calibre9">your</em>
statement?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Look,
it's possible, all right?" Harry sighed. "Just like it's
possible Mrs Malfoy sided with me, however briefly."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
…"</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
let it go," Harry pleaded. "We don't need this. It doesn't
make us any better than Voldemort."</p><p class="calibre8">The
day after the Malfoy trial a haughty looking owl delivered a package
to The Burrow. It contained Ron and Hermione's wands. Ron pocketed
his wand gratefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
suppose if Malfoy can let it go, I can let it go," Ron conceded.
"But no one had better make me talk to the git."</p><p class="calibre8">Charlie
went back to Romania at the end of June.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bye
Mum," he said patting his mother on the back as she released a
fresh flood of tears all over him. He turned to Ginny and squeezed
her tightly. "Seeya Squirt."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not a squirt," grumbled Ginny but Harry saw her cling a little
tighter to her older brother for a moment longer. Charlie shook
Percy's and his father's hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Take
Care, son," murmured Mr Weasley, communicating without words.
Charlie nodded in response and Harry wondered what it would be like
to have that sort of unspoken relationship with your father. Charlie
moved to Hermione, kissing her cheek and then gave Ron and George
back slapping hugs. When he pulled Harry into a hug he whispered in
his ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Take
care of the squirt, if you need anything, just owl." And then he
Disapparated with a short wave. Mrs Weasely spent the rest of the day
cooking everyone's favourite foods and feeding them. As he ate his
fourth serving of treacle tart, Harry contemplated that this is what
made Mrs Weasely feel better, make sure everyone else was all right.
Percy went back to his own flat a few days later with a much more
reserved and handshake heavy farewell.</p><p class="calibre8">The
days marched on relentlessly to July, there were strange explosions
coming from George's room, Ron, Harry and Ginny flew around the
orchard after raiding the broomshed while Hermione sat underneath the
apple tree and read from Seventh Year textbooks and the ghoul began
rattling his chains again. Hermione filed the extra travel paperwork.
Mr Weasley had convinced Mrs Weasley to let Ginny go with them.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
reckon that Dad just reminded Mum that if Ginny's not here, they
won't have to remember the silencing charms," Ron said slyly on
the afternoon Mrs Weasley gave her permission for Ginny to go to
Australia with the rest of them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron!"
exclaimed a red faced Hermione, slapping him on the arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
could be right," Ginny chuckled slyly. Harry just shook his head;
it wasn't something he wanted to spend his time thinking about.</p><p class="calibre8">After
a week and a half of very little exertion and complete pampering at
the hands of Mrs Weasley Harry was almost feeling like his old self
when a flurry of owls caused excitement levels to rise at the Burrow.
The first owl, bearing <em class="calibre9">The Dialy Prophet</em>
aggressively demanded its payment, pecking at Harry's hand
repeatedly until he managed to extract the right coins from his
pocket.</p><p class="calibre8">The
wizarding newspaper declared that Kingsley had been made the
permanent Minister of Magic and contained an announcement that
Hogwarts was to reopen as usual on September first. Students could
expect their Hogwarts letters within the next few weeks. Hermione
squealed and began dancing around the kitchen while Ron smiled at her
indulgently. Mrs Weasley divested an owl of an official looking
envelope which turned out to be an invitation to Teddy Lupin's
Christening on July 5th,
less than a week away.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
not Christened yet?" asked Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
they were going to do it next time it was safe to contact you," Mrs
Weasley explained. "That time never really came I suppose. It was
going to be a quiet affair, a bit secret really, especially with his
godfather having a price on his head. I expect Andromeda wants to
make a big fuss now there's no reason not to." Mrs Weasley looked
at the invitation in her hands rather wistfully. Harry opened his own
envelope from Andromeda which included a letter.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Dear
Harry,</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">I
have gone ahead and arranged Teddy's Christening. I hope you don't
mind. I'm sorry the notice is short but this is the little church
Dora was christened at and the only date free before you return to
Hogwarts. It is to be a small affair but if there is anyone you wish
to invite, let me know. Molly told me you'd been under some strain
these past few days when I contacted her to see why you'd not been
to visit. That nice Neville Longbottom has been around a couple of
times though. I invited him to the Christening. He seems to be quite
attached to little Ted.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">I
do hope you are feeling better these days and please, come over as
soon as you can. I know Teddy misses you.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Yours,
Andromeda. </em></p><p class="calibre8">Harry
felt suddenly terribly guilty. He'd been so tied up in his own
thoughts that he'd not made the time or found the energy to go and
see Teddy. He'd be back at school soon and his chances to see him
would dwindle. Ron was still eating breakfast and Mrs Weasley,
Hermione and Ginny were contemplating what to wear to the Christening
and if they had the time or the funds to get something new. Making a
decision he abruptly pulled out his Gringotts key and tossed it onto
the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Funds,"
he said briefly, as he got up. "I'm going to see Teddy today.
Just keep Ron away from my family jewels!" Ginny snickered. Ron
stopped eating long enough to make a rude hand gesture at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
many times Ronald Weasley? I will not tell you again! If I see that
one more time I'll jinx your fingers together!" his mother
shouted at him before turning on Harry. "And what do you think
you're doing?" Harry crossed his arms and simply looked at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
dragging myself out of the pit of misery I've been wallowing in,"
he said. "I've been so busy indulging in my own grief that I
forgot I even had a responsibility to Teddy. Sirius went after
Pettigrew so that he could avenge my parents and it kept him from me.
Remus spent his time in seclusion and despair instead of with me.
Teddy needs me. He's got his grandmother but he needs me too. At
least Neville remembered that." Mrs Weasley studied him silently
for a moment before speaking.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
glad you've worked that out dear," she said with a smile. "I
told Andromeda it wouldn't be long. I was actually referring to
this dear." And she waved his Gringotts key at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
don't worry. You won't have any problem making a withdrawal. I
had Bill set it up so Ginny could use it," Harry stopped abruptly,
blushing as Ron's jaw dropped. Harry shuffled his feet
uncomfortably. "Please don't say you can't accept it. When was
the last time any of you had something new? You all do so many things
for me and … please?" Mrs Weasley's face softened.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
just this once," she eventually said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good,
that's settled then," said Harry. "I'm going to change and
Floo over to see Teddy. I'll be back for dinner."</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
I get a new broom, Harry?" called Ron cheekily to his retreating
back. Harry answered with a rude hand gesture and Mrs Weasley began
to berate Ron for being so incredibly rude.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
come he doesn't get his fingers jinxed together and I'm the one
who gets into trouble?" Ron's indignant voice came wafting up the
stairs. "George was right! He is your favourite!" Harry laughed.
It was good to be with family.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
changed quickly and headed back downstairs to Floo to Andromeda's.
He found Ginny alone in the kitchen washing up and staring out the
window as if in a trance. He came up behind her and slid his arms
around her waist, kissing her on the side of the neck. She tilted her
head to give him better access and he continued to press soft kisses
along the side of her neck and behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
did you do that, Harry?" she suddenly asked, still looking out of
the window. Harry froze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
what, exactly? I've done a lot of things …" he trailed off. It
had sounded far more amusing in his head. Ginny turned in his grasp
and fixed her gaze somewhere over his left shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Set
your key up like that," was all she said. Harry pulled away from
her, his arms dropping to his sides.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
are you asking?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
I want to know," said Ginny evasively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you have a problem with it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No."
Ginny shook her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
who cares why?" Harry stuffed his hands in his pockets and turned
away to study the coat rack just inside the back door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
want to understand," was the only reply he got. Slowly he turned
around. She had turned back to the washing up and was slowly dragging
a cloth over a plate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
you are everything," he said. He took a step back towards her. "I
feel more … complete with you. It's like not being with you just
means I have to get back to you. It matters to me how you are … I
want you to be happy – "</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
and you think money will make me happy?" Ginny slapped a large pan
forcefully into the sink and it made a satisfying smacking sound as
it hit the water.</p><p class="calibre8">"No!"
said Harry fiercely. "My life isn't complete without you. So if
you're not happy … well that matters to me. And you … need to
be involved. You're happiest when I share parts of me with you."
Ginny turned to look at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry-"</p><p class="calibre8">"And
this is part of me. If I don't share all of me with you, why share
anything at all?" Harry continued. "That day the Death Eaters
came I got so panicked but I didn't tell you. Bill told me that I
<em class="calibre9">lied</em> to
you and I did. I said I was fine and I wasn't at all. I'm sorry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry I didn't apologise before now. It made me think though. I
don't want to lie to you; I want you to know all of me, every part.
Keeping something from you, anything, even my vault, isn't doing
that. My whole life is open to you. I belong to <em class="calibre9">you</em>.
Keeping anything back … keeping something apart from you isn't …
it won't … what's mine is yours." Harry took another step
forward and shrugged. "It's not about the fact that there's
money in there … so I got Bill to fix it so you had access."
Ginny stared at him. He felt pinned under her gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't care if you never touch it or if you spend it all," he said
as he reached out and took her wet, soapy hand. "I love you. This
is because I love you." Harry looked into her eyes and felt himself
caught up in eternity as he stared into their depths. Slowly he
lowered his face towards her and her eyes slid shut and her soft pink
lips parted ever so slightly. As he looked at the lashes splayed
across her cheeks and the freckles dusting across her nose he could
smell that unique flowery scent that was Ginny and as he lowered his
lips to hers he whispered, "With all my heart."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
heard the door creak open as someone came in from the hallway just as
he slid an arm around Ginny's waist and pulled her towards him,
running his tongue along her bottom lip as he did so. Her lips parted
and he deepened the kiss before a discreet cough made him pull
reluctantly away. Ginny, her eyes still closed, leaned into him,
laying her head on his chest and Harry looked up to see Ron with his
hand on the door handle obviously trying very hard not to take the
mickey out of them. He was turning purple with the effort.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
saying goodbye, Ron," said Harry. "Will words do for you or would
you like the same sort of goodbye?" Harry could feel Ginny shaking
with laughter against his chest as Ron backed out muttering something
about randy gits. Harry looked down at the beautiful woman in his
arms and pressed a kiss to her forehead.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
should get going," he said reluctantly. "I'll see you tonight.
Have fun, okay? Oh, and you look divine in green." He winked at her
and released her going to the fireplace and grabbing some Floo powder
from the pot on the mantelpiece.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
Ginny stopped him. He turned around. "I love you too." Harry
smiled and gave her a little wave as he whirled out of sight and past
the all the fireplaces to come tumbling out at Andromeda's house.</p><p class="calibre8">He
found Andromeda walking a screaming Teddy up and down the hallway,
toys strewn all over the floor and the kitchen a mess. It was
extremely unusual.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
Harry, lovely to see you dear," she said tiredly when she saw him
stepping out of the kitchen hearth. "Sorry about the mess." She
gestured vaguely at the room and resumed ineffectively patting Teddy
on the back and his screams seemed to grow even louder. Harry was at
a complete loss but he could tell that Andromeda was nearly out on
her feet so he decided to take Teddy and he pulled out a chair for
Andromeda to sit in.</p><p class="calibre8">Teddy
quieted for a brief moment when Harry took him and he took that
opportunity to set the kettle and begin making some tea – which was
no mean feat one handed. Teddy began squalling again within minutes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
little guy," soothed Harry. "What's wrong? Bad hair day? I
know, I get them a lot. I'm not sure fuchsia is your colour you
know." Teddy did not stop crying. Andromeda let out a big sigh as
Harry inelegantly plunked mug of tea in front of her on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know why he's crying. He's been doing it for hours,"
she sounded on the verge of tears herself. "I know babies do that
sometimes it's just, well … hard." Harry reached over and
patted her awkwardly on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen,
I think you need a long break," he began. "I'm sorry I haven't
been around much. It must be so hard …" he trailed off feeling
completely inadequate. Andromeda looked up at him as she sipped her
tea. Teddy seemed to be running out of steam he began sobbing quietly
and hiccupping his tiny fists grabbing handfuls of Harry's shirt.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
too old for this," she muttered. "How can I possibly be the best
person to look after him? Look at me, I'm all alone and this place
is a mess. You'd think I'd know something about looking after a
baby! But the poor soul has been crying for hours and I don't even
know how to fix it."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
are the best person to look after Teddy," said Harry softly, the
baby beginning to snore quietly on his shoulder. "You're his
family and you love him. And you don't have to do it on your own. I
know I was a bit preoccupied, but Mrs Weasley said you called – why
didn't you ask her for help? Please, call us if you need help.
Don't ever, ever think you're alone." Andromeda laid her head
down on the table and cried while Harry rocked the slumbering Teddy
in one arm and patted her back with the other. After a few minutes
she straightened up and looked at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
must think I'm a silly old woman, sobbing about the place, unable
to even keep the house straight," she said. "Well, best get on I
suppose, that is if you don't mind watching young Ted for a bit?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Get
on? To where?" demanded Harry. "You're not going to clean this
place up; you're going for a nice, long nap."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
really?" snapped Andromeda. "And who exactly will clean this
place up then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
<em class="calibre9">JOKING</em>!"
Andromeda gazed at him in horror. "That foul, loathsome little b-"
Kreacher arrived in the kitchen with a loud crack.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Master Harry?" Harry ignored the disgusted look Andromeda was
throwing his way.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher,
your services are needed here, I won't be going back to Grimmauld
Place any time soon, and well, Andromeda needs some help here for a
bit," explained Harry. Andromeda shot him a filthy look.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't believe you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Always
willing to serve a member of the Great and Noble House of Black,"
said Kreacher, bowing so low his nose swept the floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Please,
Andromeda," pleaded Harry. "Kreacher's not so bad. He's
changed a bit lately. See he's even overlooking the whole disowning
thing. You need the help. I'm going to Australia soon and then back
to Hogwarts in a couple of months. I don't need Kreacher but you
do. Please." Kreacher had already started to straighten out the
kitchen and Andromeda let out a long sigh, knowing she was defeated.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now,
pack some things for Teddy. Let me take him for a holiday at The
Burrow. Mrs Weasley would love the chance to fuss over him and Ron
won't admit it, but so would he," said Harry. "You can come and
collect him when you're rested – take as long as you need."
Andromeda looked at him warily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I suppose if Molly's going to be there…" Harry smiled and
Andromeda sighed as she got up, ruffling his hair as she passed.
"You're a good man, Harry Potter."</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
finally heard a commotion in the kitchen and happy laughing voices
drift up the stairs. He sent up a silent prayer of thanks to
whichever deity was listening. Carefully carrying his precious cargo
he hastened down the stairs and burst into the kitchen to find Ron,
Hermione and Ginny stacking all sorts of parcels on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
Mum?" he demanded desperately over the extremely loud screaming
emanating from Teddy.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
stopped off to have a bite of lunch with dad, we came on home 'cause
we couldn't bear to watch them making eyes at each other any
longer," Ron shouted, shuddering. "Why is the midget squawking
like that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know, Ron!" said Harry exasperatedly, as Ron took the
infant from his arms. "Don't you think if I knew I would do
something to stop him?" Harry immediately headed to the pantry to
fix himself a sandwich. As he gulped it down rapidly Teddy was passed
from Ron to Hermione to Ginny but did not stop screaming for any of
them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
is Teddy here?" asked Ginny as she tried desperately to soothe him
and he screwed up his face in response and wailed louder.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd
say because his Gran has gone insane with that caterwauling,"
shouted Ron in disgust. "Trying to send us all barmy as well is
she?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
exhausted," explained Harry taking Teddy from Ginny's grasp and
attempting to rock him. "I brought Teddy here for a day or two so
she can get some rest. I sent Kreacher there to help sort things out.
She's not been coping."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
how are we meant to cope?" demanded Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
for a start there are more of us than there are of her!" retorted
Harry. Teddy reacted badly to the raised voices and began to scream
even louder, something Harry had not thought possible.</p><p class="calibre8">"Has
he been fed? Changed his nappy?" asked Hermione briskly. "What
about sleep? Maybe he's sleepy? If he's fed and clean then what
else is there?" Harry simply rolled his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
might be in pain," Ginny said softly as she ran her hand over
Teddy's downy little head. He gazed back at her miserably, his lip
trembling as if threatening to unleash a fresh assault on their
eardrums. Ginny continued to stroke his head as Harry rocked him
while snuggling the baby against his chest and Teddy's eyes slowly
slipped shut.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
looked up to find Ron looking at him and Ginny with an odd wistful
look on his face. He raised an eyebrow in question but Ron merely
shrugged. Harry began to breathe a little easier as Teddy appeared to
fall into a fitful, but quiet slumber and he eased into a chair,
careful not to jostle Teddy at all. He sat there, Teddy cuddled up on
his chest and Ginny standing behind him, stroking her hands through
his hair and easing the tension that had built up after a morning of
infant wailing.</p><p class="calibre8">There
was only a few moments respite however as Mrs Weasley came out of the
Floo not long afterwards, dropping a number of parcels on the hearth,
knocking over the fire irons and stumbling into a chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
goodness, I'm not normally so inelegant," she muttered. "I must
not let Arthur order so much butterbeer next time." She looked up
startled as Teddy started up his monologue of wailing. Harry winced
and struggled to his feet to begin pacing. Mrs Weasley, abandoning
her parcels, hurried over to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodness,
what <em class="calibre9">are </em>you
doing to that poor child, Harry dear?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not <em class="calibre9">me</em>,"
said Harry in exasperation. "It's <em class="calibre9">him</em>.
He won't stop. He's barely stopped all day and he's been going
half the night!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
dear, poor Andromeda," tutted Mrs Weasley as she expertly took
Teddy from Harry's grasp.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
why he's here. She needs a break," Harry explained. "It seemed
like a good idea until I figured out that I have absolutely no idea
how to deal with him." Mrs Weasely smiled fondly at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
to worry dear. I'm sure we can figure something out." Sure
enough, before long Mrs Weasley had Teddy clean, fed and wrapped
snugly, sleeping in the cradle that had belonged to George, Ron and
Ginny. Harry shook his head wonderingly as he gazed at Teddy's
peaceful face.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
did you do that?" he breathed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Years
of practice dear," she smiled. She looked at Teddy wistfully. "I
know my last baby is nearly seventeen now but after seven babies, you
don't forget some things. Fred was my screamer, you know. He cried
all day and all night for a week when he was Ted's age. I thought
we were all going to go mad. I think Bill and Charlie looked after
George that entire week really. Bill was only seven so I'm not sure
how George survived." Mrs Weasley had a faraway look on her face
and a lone tear slid down her cheek as she thought about her twin
babies, one of whom was now lost. She seemed to pull herself together
as she wiped the tear from her cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
just did for Teddy what I eventually figured out worked for Fred.
We're just lucky it worked on a different baby," she sighed.
"They are all so different. No two are alike, even when they are
identical twins. Now, let's get on and see about dinner. I'll
just pop over and make sure Andromeda is all right for a meal, she
must have been exhausted."</p><p class="calibre8">"Kreacher's
there," said Harry absently, watching Teddy sleep. He suddenly
found himself engulfed in one of Mrs Weasley's rib cracking hugs.
As Mrs Weasley pulled away he looked at her in confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
was that for? I brought a wailing infant into your home, without
asking you first, expected you to work a miracle on him and you give
me a hug?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Harry dear, you just don't know how wonderful you are, do you?"
Mrs Weasley's eyes shone as she looked at him. Harry's was
confused but he got no explanation as Ron chose that moment to enter
the kitchen and his mother shushed him hurriedly before moving Teddy
into the living room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Blimey,
at least she got him sorted out. Kid's got a set of lungs on him
I'll give him that," said Ron. "Those girls are giggling up in
Ginny's room. I hate to contemplate what they are doing. You just
be thankful you didn't have to endure the fashion parade today. I
managed to slip away after a bit and help George fix up the shop a
bit more but blimey, girls can shop!" Harry's shoulders shook
with laughter as Ron continued his monologue about girls fussing over
books and pet shop windows and taking forever to decide ice cream
flavours but completely missing the point about broomsticks.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
a new broomstick in the window at Quality Quidditch Supplies. I think
it's a new Firebolt model," Ron paused. "Ginny seemed to care,
but then Hermione dragged her away to look at some ruddy pink quill!
You have got to come next time. We'll leave Hermione in Flourish
and Blotts and us three'll go to check out Quidditch gear."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I guess that'll be when we get our Hogwarts letters," said Harry.
"Well, not that you're going, I 'spect you'll be at the shop
anyway if students are buying school stuff. It's going to be weird
at Hogwarts without you …" he trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll
still see each other though," said Ron hurriedly. "Hogsmeade
weekends, and I'll come to every Quidditch match for sure. I can't
imagine you'll be stuck at Hogwarts though to be honest. Of age,
and Harry Potter to boot? You'd be able to get out, no worries, any
time you want."</p><p class="calibre8">"Already
can, or had you forgotten I've been doing that since I got there?
Not allowed in the third floor corridor due to enormous three headed
dog? Grab your flute and head on down anyway. Damsel in distress?
Follow the underground chamber only two people can open. Didn't get
your form signed to visit the village? Put on your Invisibility Cloak
and go underground to Honeydukes. Need to chase a dog? No problem
there's a secret passage to the Shrieking Shack. Mega dangerous
tournament? Not an issue, just portkey on out," Harry grimaced.
"Not that that one was voluntary, but still … need to rescue an
escaped convict? Jump on a Thestral! To get back in? Just fly over
the gates. Nah mate, I don't think I've ever stayed within
accepted boundaries."</p><p class="calibre8">"Always
a first time, mate. Make it a goal," said Ron slapping him on the
shoulder. "Bit of a troublemaker aren't you?</p><p class="calibre8">" Oh
yeah speaking of letters, in all the excitement this morning seems we
overlooked this one. It's for you, from Kingsley." Ron took a
letter down from the mantelpiece. Harry took the letter, turning it
over in his hands to break the seal. He read the contents and then
looked up into Ron's expectant gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
one's claimed Snape's body. Kingsley wants to know if I want to
claim it or if they should give him a quick Ministry burial."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you going to do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Claim
it."</p><p class="calibre8">*****************</p><p class="calibre8">Teddy
stayed three nights at The Burrow. Mrs Weasley's experienced hand
seemed to settle him as much as the techniques she used to stop him
crying. She showed Harry how to carry him 'just so' to ease what
was probably some sort of tummy or wind pain and how to wrap and
soothe him so that he felt warm and safe. It was tricky to remember
how to do it all at three o'clock in the morning but Harry was
determined not to put anybody out with his decision to bring home a
squalling infant and he got up to him every time he cried at night.</p><p class="calibre8">By
the end of Teddy's stay Harry knew exactly why Andromeda had looked
such a wreck the morning he had flooed in and when she came to pick
Teddy up he made her promise to keep Kreacher as long as she needed
him before heading up to his bed, intending to sleep for a week.</p><p class="calibre8">The
day of Teddy's Christening dawned bright and clear and that
afternoon, running late, Harry thumped down the stairs, bumping into
Mr Weasley as he came through the doorway at a run.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
there you are Harry, was just coming looking for you!" sad Mr
Weasley.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron,
thanks for hogging the bathroom, mate. I love a cold shower," Harry
said sourly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thought
you needed one mate," said Ron cheerily. Harry simply glowered at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on, come on, that's enough, boys," fussed Mrs Weasley. "It
won't do for you to be late, Harry dear. Now, are you sure you are
okay to Apparate there?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
thanks Mrs Weasley," said Harry. "You look very nice by the way."
Mrs Weasley beamed at hm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you dear." Harry knew she did not mean only for the compliment.
That's when Harry took a proper look at the kitchen's occupants
and saw Hermione in a new floaty sort of creation in a very soft pink
and Ginny, perched on the edge of the table in some truly
breathtaking pale green robes. She was talking animatedly with George
and must have felt Harry's eyes on her because she suddenly turned
and smiled at him. Harry moved towards her compelled by some unseen
force, but he didn't resist it. Reaching out a hand to her he
leaned in and placed a chaste kiss on her cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
look beautiful," he breathed close to her ear. She put her hands on
his chest and gazed up at him before reaching up to try and fix his
hair. Her hand trailed down his jaw and her eyes feasted on his lips
before she adjusted his collar and his tie. Harry reached up a hand
to tuck a piece of flyaway hair behind her ear and then his fingers
left a trail down her neck and across her shoulder and he slid his
arm down to take her hand in his. He was happy just to look at her,
to be the one holding her hand. Ginny looked back into his eyes and
he felt himself mesmerised by them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!
If you two stop preening each other we can get going!" Ron was
watching them exasperatedly. Harry grinned at him before hurrying out
the door behind Mr Weasley so he could Apparate to the little church
near Andromeda's house.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
can't I go with Harry?" asked Ginny as her father prepared to
Side-Along Apparate her.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
only just got his licence! He can't possibly Side-Along anyone!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dad,
he did it the other day! Harry's been able to Side-Along Apparate
people since before he was seventeen," snorted Ron. Mr Weasley
looked stunned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
on earth would be foolish enough to let an unlicensed sixteen year
old Apparate them?" barked Mrs Weasley, clearly she suspected Ron
would.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
Dumbledore," muttered Harry, irritated. Mr and Mrs Weasley fell
silent and Harry, feeling conspicuous under their gaze simply mumbled
that he would see them all there and Apparated away quickly.</p><p class="calibre8">His
part in the Christening dictated that Harry did not sit with the
Weasleys so he did not speak to them again until after the service.
The incident before they left had put him a little off kilter but
holding Teddy, dressed in an antique Christening gown that had
belonged to Ted Tonks's Muggle family made him feel a little more
balanced and he began to relax.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ted's
family was quite religious you know," said Andromeda as they sat
near the front, waiting for the service to begin. "A couple of his
cousins have come today, ones that understand the magical world –
there's no way I can disguise that hair!" Harry grinned as Teddy
blew bubbles and turned his previously turquoise hair black like
Harry's. Andromeda went on to explain how some Muggleborns combined
their Muggle church heritage with their magical world so there were a
few churches around where the priests and pastors were able to
perform the religious rites for wizarding children.</p><p class="calibre8">This
satisfied the curiosity Harry had about his own Christening and the
completely secular nature of Dumbledore's funeral and Bill's
wedding which had been performed by wizarding officials. With a
Muggleborn mother he'd had access to Muggle church rituals as did
little Teddy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dora
and Remus didn't name any other godparents, so it's just you,"
explained Andromeda as she gave him the service sheet that indicated
his part in the service. Harry saw the Weasleys and Hermione file
into the church and sit with Bill and Fleur just before the pastor
began the Christening. He wondered vaguely what had kept them as he'd
Disapparated a good twenty minutes earlier but his involvement in the
ceremony distracted him and he turned his full attention to Teddy.</p><p class="calibre8">Without
the presence of Teddy's parents, Harry alone presented him for the
Christening rite, Andromeda declining to stand in for her daughter
and son in law, sitting quietly and shedding a few silent tears that
they had missed this. Harry made a promise then to always be there
for every big moment and lots of small moments in Teddy's life. He
couldn't afford to wallow in depression; he felt an undeniable need
to make sure Teddy's life was free from the miseries that he'd
experienced. As he took part in the Christening ceremony the promise
was cemented.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
didn't have much experience with churches and God but as he
promised the rites of the church he applied them equally to the
wizarding community.</p><p class="calibre8">"Will
you pray for him, draw him by our example into the community of faith
and walk with him in the way of Christ?" intoned the pastor. As
Harry answered that he would, he applied that to providing for Teddy
examples of being a good man, the sort of man his father had been,
how Remus would have showed him how to be a good man if he had lived,
and a lone tear rolled down Harry's cheek, splashing into the
delicate, yellowing lace of the Christening gown as he vowed in his
heart to always walk with Teddy in the wizarding community which he
himself had been denied for so long.</p><p class="calibre8">"Will
you care for him and help him take his place within the life and
worship of Christ's Church?" droned the pastor. Harry said that
he would, at the same time he gazed at Teddy and vowed to help him
find and take his place as a wizard and know about his family. In his
mind he promised Sirius that he'd be a better godfather than him
and he rather felt that he heard Sirius laughing and possibly his dad
and Remus joining in. The thought made him smile as he silently
promised Teddy that he'd always be there for him, for anything.</p><p class="calibre8">The
pastor baptised Teddy and pronounced blessings on him that Harry was
not really aware of, his thoughts now turning to Ginny as he watched
her, sitting quietly with her family. She smiled up at him and he
smiled back. When the service was over and the pictures taken, the
flash going off reminding Harry of Colin but the feeling was not sad
or panicky for once but a warm memory, Harry took his godson over to
see Ginny. He turned his hair red when he saw Ginny and neither of
them saw Mrs Weasley looking at them fondly as they fussed over the
infant in Ginny's arms. Harry slipped an arm around Ginny's
slender waist and leaned down to press a kiss to her cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry," he whispered in her ear. "I shouldn't have left like
that; it was a bit rude of me. I just-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
okay, Harry," interrupted Ginny. "We understand. You should have
heard Ron go off at Mum and Dad. I think he ranted for a good fifteen
minutes! Hermione had to threaten to hex him to get him to stop."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did he say?" asked Harry curiously as he tickled Teddy's tummy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Some
pretty choice words about being polite and it wasn't the Done Thing
to question the skills of Harry Potter," Ginny giggled. "It was
quite funny actually. Mum just stood there with her mouth opening and
closing like a fish and dad sort of stared at him like he had two
heads. Then Ron went off on a tangent about how it wasn't smart to
question your abilities if they want the house to remain standing
because he's seen you get when you're angry and if they're
going to set you off while you're still … well, a bit upset from
the 'whole war thing', they could have a major magical
catastrophe on their hands." Harry looked startled.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
does he mean I'm a 'bit upset'?" demanded Harry. Ginny
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
you are," she said. "It's not like we haven't seen you moody
before, no one cares, but your moods do swing a bit suddenly at the
moment." Ginny looked at him apologetically. Harry felt defensive
and crossed his arms over his chest. Ginny put a hand softly on his
arm and went on. "And that's okay. Anyway he got into full stride
and started going on about all sorts of odd things that no one quite
got the gist of. I think he was basically saying they have to
remember you're an adult and extremely powerful and use a lot more
tact, or something. I'm not really sure. That's when Hermione
threatened to hex him."</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
this extremely powerful rubbish?" scoffed Harry, still defensive.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
come on Harry, you know you are," snapped Ginny. She began to walk
away as Teddy, sensing the argument, began to fret. Harry followed
her, watching as she handed the baby to Andromeda. Ginny turned back
to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I'm not," he whispered fiercely at her, a grim smile plastered on
his face as he waved at Hagrid who was stuck outside, a little too
big to get in through the doors and had watched the Christening
through a window specially modified for the day.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
you are so, stop being difficult," sighed Ginny. "Do all thirteen
year olds conjure fully corporeal Patronuses? Do fourteen year olds
win Triwizard Tournaments?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Crouch
fixed that! And what about Cedric?" snapped Harry. Ginny barked a
short burst of laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that just proves my point. He was seventeen! You totally matched
him," said Ginny exasperatedly. "You learned all those spells on
your own. How many people can summon something with <em class="calibre9">Accio</em>
from the castle to the Forest? I can barely get something across the
classroom most days!" Harry was still looking at her grimly, his
eyes narrowed. Folding her arms across her own chest she narrowed her
eyes right back at him. Harry tried not to notice what that did to
rearrange her chest and how beautiful she was when she was flushed.
He forced his mind back to what she was saying.</p><p class="calibre8">"Most
of us can't fight off possession by evil wizards," she hissed.
Harry blanched. "Other people get him in their head and he takes
over. <em class="calibre9">You</em>
on the other hand are strong enough and powerful enough to put up
with him in your head and throw him out if you so choose." She
broke off and looked at him for a long moment before turning and
stomping off.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
watched her retreating back in a daze, her slim ankles showing
beneath the hem of her robes which clung to her in all the right
places. It occurred to him a little too late that he should go after
her. Standing motionless he was soon caught up in a crowd of guests,
all of whom wanted to talk to him.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
politely, and a little distractedly, made small talk with the guests
at the Christening. He went back to Andromeda's garden where tea
was served ably by Kreacher but with the duties of being godfather he
never seemed to get a moment near Ginny, let alone a chance to talk
with her. He endured introductions to all of Ted Tonks's Muggle
cousins and a long winded conversation with Dedalus Diggle about the
Dursleys. There were official duties like cutting the cake and
thanking everyone for coming. Ron and Hermione seemed to have
disappeared and Harry was soon cornered by Neville who launched into
a long monologue about his plans for the year.</p><p class="calibre8">He'd
decided to return to Hogwarts and properly complete his NEWTS and
Harry fidgeted through a long winded description of who Neville
thought might make a good replacement Defence Against the Dark Arts
instructor and who would be the new Muggle Studies teacher.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
doubt McGonagall will put the curriculum back the way it's supposed
to be," said Neville confidently. "Two most important subjects I
reckon. We have a lot of ground to make up with Muggleborn relations
I'd say after last year. Got to do a lot of work to undo the
rubbish we were taught in Dark Arts last year. Who'd you reckon
would be good at it, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
er, I dunno, Neville. An Auror would be good probably," said Harry
vaguely as he scanned the crowd for Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
Sprout said the herd has welcomed Firenze back into the Forest, so
Trelawney's back to being the lone Divination teacher. I can't
believe some people put stock in that stuff you know," Neville
sighed and affected a dreamy look that startled Harry. "Still it's
what makes some people tick you know. For me it's plants. For
Parvati it's Divination…"</p><p class="calibre8">"Pavarti?"
asked Harry, ceasing his search for Ginny as he focused on Neville
properly. "What's going on with you and Parvati then?" Harry
wished he had not asked. Neville commenced a discourse on her
bravery, beauty, grit and determination that went for a full ten
minutes.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
she likes dancing too. She's been helping me learn how to do it
without, you know, stepping on her toes," Neville said wryly. "Poor
Ginny never once complained at the Yule Ball you know."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
yeah, she's a great dancer," said Harry distractedly as he
spotted Ginny with her parents, talking to Andromeda. They looked
like they were saying goodbye. "Listen, Neville, why don't you
stop by The Burrow some time, bring Pavarti. I've got to go." And
he dashed off, leaving Neville waving after him cheerily and saying
he'd be by sometime next week. Weaving through the crowd he reached
Andromeda just as Ginny and her parents Disapparated. He groaned
aloud.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
there you are Harry!" exclaimed Andromeda and she dragged him off
to meet a series of people whom Harry could not remember and who he
never expected to see again. It was nearly dark by the time he
returned home. Ron and Hermione had returned to the Christening half
an hour before, looking not a little bit disheveled, and Harry ribbed
them about it for the whole time they spent helping Kreacher clear
up. They said good night to Andromeda and Harry promised he'd be
back later in the week before they Disapparated back to The Burrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello
dears," called Mrs Weasley from the stove where she was making hot
chocolate when they walked into the kitchen, Harry still mocking Ron
and Hermione over their earlier disappearing act. "I wondered when
you'd be home; it is getting on a bit." She walked over to Harry
and pulled him into a gentle hug. "You did wonderfully today dear.
We're very proud of you and, well I'm sorry about this morning I
was a little surprised is all. Ron er, set us straight though. I'm
sorry I underestimated you." Harry smiled wryly.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
I heard. Where's Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
went on up to her room as soon as we got home," Mrs Weasley paused,
looking thoughtful. "She's been a bit quiet all afternoon. I
haven't been able to figure out what's wrong." Harry sighed and
flopped into a chair.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think we might have had a bit of a disagreement."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
<em class="calibre9">think</em>?"
asked Hermione incredulously. "How can you not <em class="calibre9">know</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did you say?" asked Ron resignedly as he pinched a biscuit from the
plate on the table and perched himself expectantly on the sideboard.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
do you know <em class="calibre9">I</em>
said anything?" said Harry defensively. Hermione just raised her
eyebrow at him and Harry sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
should go and apologise," stated Ron as he stuffed another biscuit
in his mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
hang on! How do you know I've got something to apologise for?"</p><p class="calibre8">When
Ron raised his eyebrow at him Harry merely sighed and stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
so you all know, I am going to go and apologise now," announced
Harry as he headed for the stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
good show Harry, you'll get points for that," said George as he
entered the kitchen. Giving George a glare Harry ascended the stairs
mumbling about smart alecks and he heard Mrs Weasley call after him
that she could see what he was doing with his fingers and she
wouldn't hesitate to jinx them together next time.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron's
laughter echoed up the stairs after him.</p>
