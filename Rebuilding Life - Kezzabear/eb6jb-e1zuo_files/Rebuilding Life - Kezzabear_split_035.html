<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_36">*Chapter 35*: Chapter 35</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
35. Mystery</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Life fell into a
peaceful rhythm of classes, Quidditch practice and studying. Harry
got far too many harsh looks from Hermione if he tried to interfere
with Ginny's study schedule. Instead, he snatched brief moments
with her before breakfast or after Quidditch practice. Although they
often found themselves in the empty changing rooms after practices
there was no further attempt to do anything but get changed and
hasten back to the castle before they froze; winter was coming early
and with a vengeance. Neville began to fret about the strength of the
charms on Greenhouse Three despite learning them from Professor
Sprout and casting them himself. He could often be found tending his
plants between classes and after dinner. Professor Crockwell made
great inroads into making Muggle Studies a meaningful subject,
although her credibility slipped a little when she suggested Draco
Malfoy play Twister with Seamus Finnegan.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not playing
some ridiculous party game with that … buffoon!" he screeched.
Seamus made a face behind Malfoy's back and Professor Crockwell
attempted to look stern.</p><p class="calibre8">"Young man," she
said, turning to Malfoy. "I am not accustomed to being … defied
in this manner."</p><p class="calibre8">"You cannot, in
all sincerity, suggest that Muggles play this game?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Indeed they do,
Mr Malfoy," Professor Crockwell insisted. Malfoy looked
distastefully at the mat. The look was mirrored on the faces of a
number of other students, including Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am not sure
playing <em class="calibre9">Twister</em> is teaching us anything," she whispered out
of the side of her mouth to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"I dunno,
Hermione," Dean whispered from behind her. "It's actually very
enjoyable ... in the right circumstances." He nudged Ginny with the
toe of his trainer and smirked at her. Ginny turned a very
interesting shade of red and refused to look anywhere but at the
floor.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am <em class="calibre9">not</em>
playing this ridiculous game," said Malfoy, crossing his arms over
his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I am!"
exclaimed Seamus. "Audrey?" He smiled suggestively at the girl
but Harry rather thought he looked more disturbing than alluring.
Audrey visibly shuddered and distanced herself as far as she could
from Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right then, Mr
Thomas," said Professor Crockwell briskly. "You'll do. Up you
get."</p><p class="calibre8">"Him?" squawked
Seamus as Dean grinned broadly and swaggered over to him. Professor
Crockwell was too busy spinning the selector to notice when Dean
swatted Seamus on the behind exaggeratedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop that,"
Seamus hissed, batting Dean's hand away.</p><p class="calibre8">Later Harry and
Neville had to listen as Seamus moaned about his lost chances with
Audrey after she'd witnessed his face up close and personal with
Dean's crotch. Harry was very glad when Professor Crockwell moved
on from Muggle board games to literature. He could sleep through that
and it didn't make him want to hex Dean for playing suggestive
party games with Ginny. He tried not to laugh when he caught Malfoy
with his nose in a book of Romantic poetry in the corridor.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry spent part of
every weekend with Teddy and returned to Hogwarts after a few days or
a few hours with stories he told Ginny as they lounged by the common
room fire late at night and photos that he spellotaped above his bed.
Defence classes were moments where Harry could really be himself. The
seventh years perfected their defensive spells and staged mock duels.
Draco Malfoy began to look at Harry with something less than
loathing, while Professor Fiesche continued to glare at him haughtily
from the Head table and in the corridors.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you think
his problem is anyway?" Ron asked after he had encountered the
Professor for the first time as the two of them hurried through the
Entrance Hall on the way back from the Quidditch Pitch late one
Saturday afternoon. Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"He never speaks
to me he just sort of … stares like that," Harry replied, blowing
on his fingertips before shoving his hands deep in his pockets in an
attempt to thaw them. Ron turned to look at the retreating professor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Looks like a
Death Eater," he grunted. Harry rolled his eyes at Ron behind his
back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on," he
said, "let's go shower before it's time to eat. I don't know
why you wouldn't just shower in the change rooms."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not going to go
in there after the last time, thanks," Ron muttered. "Who knows
what you've been up to in there?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing has <em class="calibre9">gone
on</em> in there!" exclaimed Harry indignantly. Ron just grunted and
took the Grand Staircase two at a time.</p><p class="calibre8">They were about to
step off the third floor landing and head to the fourth floor when
the staircase suddenly swung around and they found themselves going
down.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is the
stupidest staircase in the whole world," muttered Ron as they
jumped off at the second floor landing before the staircase forced
them back down again.</p><p class="calibre8">"No argument from
me," Harry agreed as he pushed open a nearby portrait. The
occupant of which was a slightly balding wizard holding a very large
tray of sandwiches. "Come on, why are we bothering with the
staircase? Let's go through the secret passages."</p><p class="calibre8">"There's one
here?" Ron asked as he clambered through.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, Ginny and I
found it last week," replied Harry absently as he lit his wand and
started climbing the steep steps on the other side of the portrait.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh really?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, we didn't
feel like talking to Filch and the portrait sort of ... summoned us,
I guess, you could say," Harry said flicking his wand upwards and
inspecting the torches on the wall. "It whistled and swung open.
Hey, can you light these torches, mate?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You and Ginny …
miraculously found a secret passage?" Ron sounded like he was
trying not to laugh. Harry swung his lit wand tip in Ron's face. He
was smirking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly Ron,"
Harry huffed at him. "This staircase is so steep it's practically
a ladder! It's not exactly the safest place for-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I dunno, that
could makes things interesting," Ron chuckled. Harry shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am going to
pretend you didn't just say that." The two of them kept climbing
the staircase, lighting the torches as they went. The stairs went up
and up in one long, straight line almost directly vertical. Harry was
starting to feel just a little dizzy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where does it go,
mate?" Ron asked eventually, leaning on the wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, the other
day it went to the seventh floor," Harry said. "It wasn't this
long, though. This is really odd." He peered ahead but the
staircase vanished into darkness.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
structurally impossible as well," Ron grumbled. "Shouldn't it
curve or have landings or something?" Harry lit his wand again and
began shining it around. The walls were smooth stone and cobwebs
hanging from the wall torches spoke of disuse. If he looked down too
hastily he felt like he was going to fall. He noticed Ron had one
hand tightly on the wall as if to hold himself up. There was no
handrail and Harry suddenly felt distinctly unwell.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is really
weird," he said, shuffling towards the wall. He put his hand out
and was startled to see it disappear into the wall. Harry pulled it
out again with a yelp.</p><p class="calibre8">"What the bloody
hell was that?" Ron said incredulously. "Did your hand just …
vanish?" Ron shuffled over and prodded the wall experimentally. It
didn't give and his hand did not vanish. He shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"It did … but it
isn't now," said Harry, frowning.</p><p class="calibre8">"You reckon it's
like the platform?" asked Ron, running his hands over his side of
the stairwell. "Why would it be there one minute and not the next?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I dunno, it's
weird," murmured Harry. He reached out to press tentatively against
the wall. A wave of nausea washed over Harry as his eyes flicked
downward and he put out his other hand to steady himself, losing it
up to his elbow in the stone. Ron made a wordless, strangled yelping
sound.</p><p class="calibre8">"That looks so
weird," he said, shaking his head. Harry wriggled his fingers
experimentally before pressing his other hand to the wall, next to
the first. He could still feel his hands; he just had no idea where
they were. Harry pressed further into the wall. He was soon shoulder
deep into the wall with both arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I guess it's
time to stick my face in," Harry said, glancing at Ron nervously,
"and find out where it goes."</p><p class="calibre8">"We could just …
you know, walk away," Ron said pensively, staring at where Harry's
arms met the wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"We could …"
Harry trailed off, staring at Ron. Suddenly Ron grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"You honestly
thought I was serious, didn't you?" Ron asked, shaking his head.
"You're going soft now you've taken out old Moldyshorts!" Ron
cackled gleefully and pushed at the back of Harry's head, tripping
over his feet. Both of them fell, sprawling through the wall of the
hidden staircase and landing in a cavernous room that was empty save
for a couple of pieces of dusty, broken furniture and a few scattered
paintings hanging crookedly on the walls.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry scrambled to
his feet and dusted himself off hurriedly before slowly stepping into
the room. He gazed about, noting the elaborate chandeliers which
seemed to glow with a strange light, making the gilt-edged frames
around the paintings shine. There was a low door at one end of the
room and the chaise lounges lining the edge of one wall looked as
though they had once been upholstered in very opulent red velvet. Now
they looked a bit faded and threadbare.</p><p class="calibre8">"All a bit
Gryffindor, isn't it, mate?" Ron said shuffling up behind him.
His footsteps caused clouds of dust to rise from the faded red carpet
under their feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where do you
suppose we are?" Harry asked, inspecting a nearby sleeping portrait
and rubbing ineffectively at the nameplate at the bottom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Godric's
boudoir?" grinned Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think of
nothing else?" Harry asked in exasperation. He rolled his eyes at
his friend. "It looks more like a dance hall." Harry wandered
along the wall, squinting at the snoozing portraits and stopped in
front of a particularly pretty landscape featuring a lake.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, if you
dance on carpet," said Ron, stomping his foot dramatically and
making a cloud of dust rise up around them. Harry coughed and
spluttered. Ron continued. "It's a bit odd, isn't it? That this
room is here; it was never on the map."</p><p class="calibre8">"Neither was the
Room of Requirement or the Chamber of Secrets," Harry shrugged as
he crossed to a plinth that was leaning drunkenly against one wall,
the marble bust that had probably once been atop it smashed below it
on the floor. He straightened the plinth and waved his wand at the
broken pieces of the bust. "iReparo/i."</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you
reckon it is?" Ron asked as he used the sleeve of his robes to wipe
the grime off the brass plate on the edge of the plinth.</p><p class="calibre8">"A room … a big
empty, dusty room," replied Harry wryly. He stared around.
"There're lots of places in this castle that are old and unused."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, but it's
not on the map," Ron said again as he gazed at the ceiling. It was
high and arched, etched stone forming decorative mouldings around the
chandelier hangings.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's a bit
uninteresting, to tell you the truth," muttered Harry, striding
towards the wall they had come through. "Come on, let's get up
and showered. I'd like to spend some time with Ginny this weekend."</p><p class="calibre8">"Right," said
Ron, easily overtaking Harry to get to the wall. "Don't want to
get in the way of the lovebirds, Hallowe'en's not far away."
Harry smacked him in the back of the head and Ron grinned at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop that,"
Harry snapped. "It's disturbing when you push us together." Ron
chuckled and reached out and put his hand on the wall and it met with
solid resistance. Harry groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fantastic," Ron
said sourly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I guess we
try the little door then," Harry sighed. "Why can't my life be
easy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm never going
to fit through there," said Ron, eyeing the doorway speculatively
as they stood in front of it. He clapped Harry on the back soundly.
"Good thing you're a skinny little runt!" Harry glowered at him
as he grasped the handle. As soon as he touched it the door began to
change shape, to grow until it was just the right height for Harry to
go through. The space beyond was dark and Harry looked at Ron who had
pulled out his wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Think we should
go through?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Ron
nodded. "Dunno where we're going but … here, let me go first."
Harry started to protest and then saw the look in Ron's eyes. He
wasn't about to let anything hurt or harm Harry at that moment and
Ron was going first. Harry stepped back out of the way and Ron sidled
past, ducking through the doorway and lighting his wand as he stepped
over the threshold. Harry followed closely behind.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron swung his wand
in a wide arc, the light from the tip bouncing off a vast array of
metallic objects that hung on the walls. There were suits of armour
hanging drunkenly from wooden beams, a cluster of swords and fencing
foils and a case lined with vicious looking daggers. There was no
carpet in this room and no gilt edging. The stone walls were
blackened with scorch marks and rough looking torches were hanging
haphazardly from wall sconces. Harry cast <em class="calibre9">Incendio</em> at the
nearest torch and he and Ron shielded their eyes at the sudden light
that infused the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you
reckon all this is?" Ron asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Belonged to
someone who liked blades," grimaced Harry imagining the room as a
chamber in one of Dudley's particularly violent video games. "The
carnage you could create with this stuff …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
that was what it was for," Ron said thoughtfully, advancing into
the room. He lit another of the torches and the remainder of the room
was lit up, revealing it was bigger than Harry had first thought.</p><p class="calibre8">At the other side of
the room from the doorway through which they had entered stood a
duelling platform. It was slightly raised and looked as though it had
once been slightly padded although the fabric on it was torn and
rotting. What looked like horsehair spilled from the gashes in the
fabric and a pair of protective gloves lay idly at one end.</p><p class="calibre8">"You reckon they
practiced duelling in here?" Harry asked, picking up one of the
gloves and turning it over in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think they may
have taught it here," Ron murmured as he ran his fingers over a
nearby case of oddly shaped helmets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Long time ago,"
Harry added, laying the glove back down. "So, how do we get out of
this room?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Fireplace?" Ron
shrugged, waving carelessly at a huge stone fireplace to their left.</p><p class="calibre8">"Got any Floo
powder?" Harry was ready to be sarcastic when Ron pulled a bag out
of his pocket.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did you think
I would get home?" he asked. "You know McGonagall doesn't allow
me to keep the Floo powder on the common room mantle piece, in case
some first year gets it into his head to Floo home for lunch."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd forgotten
that," Harry said quietly. Harry had forgotten that Ron was leaving
soon, that Ron didn't live here during the term any more, wouldn't
snore all night, wouldn't be around in the morning. It was easy to
forget, roaming the castle with Ron and uncovering new delights that
things weren't as they had been … before.</p><p class="calibre8">"So where do you
think we should Floo to?" Ron asked, sticking his head in the
fireplace and peering up the chimney.</p><p class="calibre8">"Common room, I
suppose," Harry shrugged. Ron lit a fire in the grate and took a
handful of Floo powder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gryffindor common
room!" he called out as he threw the powder. Ron whirled away and
it was then Harry realised he'd taken the Floo powder with him.</p><p class="calibre8">Cursing, Harry made
his way back to the first room, dousing the torches as he went. Ron
couldn't bring the Floo powder back to him through the fireplace
considering they had no idea where they were. Harry would have to try
and get back through that ridiculous wall. He slammed the door
between the two rooms shut and watched as it shrank back down before
stomping across the room, raising dust with his feet. He stopped
halfway across the room, something glittering on the floor catching
his eye. Harry bent down to scoop it up.</p><p class="calibre8">It was a piece of
jewellery, probably part of a necklace. There was a broken golden
chain and a pendant studded with tiny jewels slipped off the end of
it as he picked it up, bouncing across the carpet. Harry scooped it
up and turned the shiny bauble over in his fingers carefully. The
pendant looked familiar, like he'd just seen it and he struggled to
remember where from. It looked valuable, too valuable to be lying
broken and forgotten on the floor of an old, empty room.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked up and
scanned the room as if it could tell him where the pendant came from.
Idly spinning it in his fingers Harry began to inspect most of the
paintings, skipping over the landscapes and focussing on the
portraits. Who were these people and why were their portraits hanging
in this hidden room?</p><p class="calibre8">Hidden room …
Harry turned the words over in his mind as his fingers worried at the
pendant. He paused in front of a portrait of a rather corpulent lady
in long flowing red robes. She was dressed much as the Grey Lady was,
like most of the portraits Harry realised. He gazed at the portraits,
all of whom were sleeping. The paintings were old, some had cracked
paint and all of them were dressed in a very old-fashioned manner. He
stopped suddenly at the one he had tried to clean the nameplate of
before. There, lying against the breast of another fairly robust
woman was the pendant he now held in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">With increasing
urgency he rubbed at the nameplate once again. He laughed at himself
after several futile minutes and got out his wand, aiming at the
frame and muttering a <em class="calibre9">Scourgify</em>. The gilt frame gleamed and
even the paint seemed to brighten. Harry peered at the nameplate.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">Glenda
Gryffindor</em></p><p class="calibre8">The dates underneath
were indistinct but Harry thought one might have read 1359 or
something similar. There was nothing else to indicate who the
sleeping woman was but Harry rather thought Ron might be at least
partially right – something about this room told him it belonged to
Gryffindor; the House or the man, he could not be certain. He looked
around, seeing nothing else that would give him a clue as to who this
room belonged to. A few portions of wood panelled wall caught his
attention.</p><p class="calibre8">They had probably
been there before, the room had given no indication of changing
itself around him, but they seemed strangely out of place on the
stone walls. Slipping the pendant and broken chain in his pocket he
padded over to the wood panels. He stood in front of them for a
moment with the absurd urge to start knocking on them. He had a mad
picture of himself in his head, like a character in one of Dudley's
television shows, finding a secret passage that led to solving an age
old mystery.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry snorted to
himself. How many years had he spent in an enchanted castle finding
secret passages and tunnels and still, for a moment, he thought he
was James Bond? Ending his silent speculation of the panels he
started to poke them, running his hands over the smooth surfaces,
looking for indentations, things to push, levers to pull. Nothing
happened. Harry took a few steps back and surveyed the panels
thoughtfully. He knew they hid something. He had no idea what it was
or how to get to it, but he desperately wanted to find out. He
studied the panels carefully looking at the patterns etched around
the edges.</p><p class="calibre8">They weren't
patterns he suddenly realised, they were runes. Harry cursed himself
for never taking Ancient Runes and wished he had some parchment to
copy them down to show Hermione when he suddenly heard a scratching
sound coming from the wall he'd fallen through earlier. He watched
with fascination as a hand suddenly pushed its way through. He
thought he could hear whispers murmuring at the wall from the other
side. The hand abruptly disappeared. Harry stole over to the wall
wondering if it had been Ron or … no one else knew about this room
he was sure of that. No one had probably been here in centuries.</p><p class="calibre8">The hand appeared
again, as suddenly as it had vanished last time. Harry studied the
hand carefully. It was devoid of freckles. Not Ron then. He took a
step backwards. The hand came further into the room and Harry
imagined he heard someone whimpering. He didn't feel threatened and
yet he pulled his wand out anyway, taking a few steps backwards. He
was only just in time to avoid Neville stumbling through the wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"-just like the
bloody platform, you wimp!" Ginny followed Neville through, falling
on top of him, the two of them landing in a heap on the floor and
raising a cloud of dust. Harry coughed and waved frantically to clear
the air.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh that's
nice," Neville muttered mutinously, disentangling himself from
Ginny. "I do this to save <em class="calibre9">your</em> boyfriend and all you can do
is swear at me like a sailor."</p><p class="calibre8">"Where are Ron and
Hermione and Luna?" Ginny stood up and examined the wall, pressing
her hands against it urgently. "Why didn't they come through?"
Neville looked up and noticed Harry watching them in amusement.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" the
other man said, sounding incredibly relieved. "We found you!"
Ginny spun around so quickly she nearly lost her balance.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry! You're
all right!" She threw herself at him, holding him in a vice like
grip, which threatened to cut off his oxygen supply.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron came flying
out of the fireplace and then he stood there, watching it for ages.
It was really weird," Neville said as Harry loosened Ginny's hold
on his neck. "Hermione asked what he was doing and that's when he
held up his bag of Floo powder and sort of went white."</p><p class="calibre8">"He said he lost
you," Ginny murmured into Harry's chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stupid git took
the Floo powder through the Floo with him," muttered Harry. "You
lot took your time coming to find me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron couldn't
get through the wall," Ginny said looking up at him. "He tried
and tried and nothing worked we've been wandering up and down the
stairs and then Neville and Luna showed up-"</p><p class="calibre8">"We were just
trying to get away from Filch," muttered Neville. "He watches us.
I think he thinks we're sneaking off to … you know." Neville
blushed a bright red and waved a hand ineffectually. Harry grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"So he started
helping us," Ginny continued. "Ron said you were probably
trapped, you couldn't get through the wall again and … I didn't
think we were going to find you!" Her eyes were shining brightly
with tears and Harry realised she was close to tears or hysteria.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhh, you've
found me now," he soothed, stroking her hair softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, only how
will we get out again?" Neville said glumly. "Ron's still got
the Floo powder." Neville cursed violently and swung his fist at
the wall.</p><p class="calibre8">No one was more
surprised than Harry to see Neville's fist go sailing through it.
Neville lost his balance and his head and torso fell through the
wall, his legs sticking out from the wall on the floor incongruously.</p><p class="calibre8">"What the …"
Harry darted to the wall, stretching his hand out; he hovered in
front of the wall uncertainly. Ginny had no such qualms and slapped
the wall with both hands as Neville's feet dragged through and
vanished.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's solid!"
she cried exasperatedly. Harry looked at her before carefully
pressing his hand against the wall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only Ron tried to
get through before," Harry said as his hand disappeared into the
stonework. Ginny's jaw dropped. "I'm not sure why, but … it's
me and Neville …"</p><p class="calibre8">Taking a deep breath
he pushed his face through the wall. Hermione, Ron, Neville and Luna
were standing on the other side.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello!" he said
cheerfully. Hermione gave a strangled scream.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello, Harry
Potter," Luna said calmly. Ron stared at him before slapping the
wall near his left ear. Harry winced and stretched an arm through the
wall, grasping Hermione's hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville, grab Ron
and step through," Harry said and pulled himself back through the
wall. Hermione followed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Merlin, Harry!"
Hermione breathed when she caught her breath. Neville and Ron
appeared at that moment. Neville had a sort of grimace on his face
suggesting he was not in favour of this method of travelling through
walls. Harry grinned at him and stuck and arm through the wall. He
felt Luna grab his hand and pulled backwards but her hand slipped out
of his grasp and his own was empty when he pulled it back through.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry frowned and
tried again with the same result. He cast a helpless look at the
others and stepped fully through the wall and into the staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"I do not think I
can get through, Harry," Luna said serenely. She was perched on one
of the steps, leaning against the opposite wall. She pulled a
<em class="calibre9">Quibbler</em> out of her bag. "I will wait here until
Gryffindor's room has finished showing you its secrets."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry just stared at
her, nodded and stepped back through the wall into the cavernous room
beyond.</p><p class="calibre8">"-so it must be,
don't you see?" Hermione was standing in the middle of the room
flushed and excited. "Oh Harry, it's another secret chamber!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Secret room,"
muttered Ginny mutinously. "Can we please call it a room?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Not just a room,"
Ron said, striding to the tiny door and grasping the handle. The door
swung open but did not get larger. "That's odd." Ron frowned at
the door and pushed it closed before opening it again.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's odd?"
asked Neville. He looked awestruck and stared wide-eyed around the
room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry opened it
and it grew big enough to fit him through," Ron said, pushing the
door closed again and turning to face the others. "Harry, where's
Luna?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She um … she
couldn't get through," Harry shrugged. "She told me she'd
wait for us after Gryffindor's room had finished showing us its
secrets."</p><p class="calibre8">"Told you it was a
room," Ginny smirked. Neville made his way to the little door Ron
was glowering at and reached out a hand, grasping the door knob.
Hermione gasped.</p><p class="calibre8">The door was
growing, expanding, getting wider and getting taller.</p><p class="calibre8">"How come it works
for him?" Ron grumbled belligerently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, obviously
the room responds to them," Hermione said thoughtfully. "They are
the ones who can get through the wall as well."</p><p class="calibre8">"Because they're
Gryffindors?" Ginny asked, frowning.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're all
Gryffindors," Ron retorted. "Except Luna."</p><p class="calibre8">"And she couldn't
get in at all," Hermione mused. "What have Neville and Harry got
in common then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Blokes of the
same age," Ron said immediately. "Which would mean something if I
wasn't also a bloke … the same age as them." He looked glum and
glared at the door malevolently. Neville had pushed it open and was
peering around the doorframe.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not the
prophecy is it," he said as he pulled his head back into the room.
"We were both … mentioned … sort of …" Hermione shook her
head, beginning to pace around the room. She stopped in front of the
portrait Harry had cleaned. She peered at the nameplate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Glenda …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's Glenda?"
Ron asked loudly, still glaring at the door into the duelling room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gryffindor?"
Ginny asked, crossing swiftly to where Hermione was examining the
portrait of the woman wearing the pendant. "Glenda Gryffindor was
the last known descendant of Godric Gryffindor. She was a teacher
here at Hogwarts until sometime in the thirteen hundreds and she ...
went missing." Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you know
all that?" Ron asked incredulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I read, Ronald,"
Ginny replied loftily. It was such an uncanny impression of Hermione
that Harry struggled not to laugh.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't believe
the last Gryffindor was a <em class="calibre9">girl</em>," Ron grumbled. Ginny's
eyes flashed fire and Harry spoke hastily before she could react.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione can you
come look at these runes?" he asked, overly loudly and gesturing
towards the wooden panels. Hermione hurried over, immediately lost in
the runes.</p><p class="calibre8">"C'mon," Harry
gestured to Neville and Ginny, "we'll show you the duelling
room." The four of them went through the doorway and, lighting the
torches on the wall, gazed around at the glittering array of weaponry
and armour.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's like some
sort of … armoury," Neville murmured. He wandered to a nearby
display case of swords and daggers lying open on a side table. The
metallic instruments were strewn haphazardly. Neville picked up one
of the daggers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you sure
that's safe, Neville?" Ginny asked, alarmed. Neville swung to
look at her, the blade of the dagger flashed in the torchlight.</p><p class="calibre8">"It matches the
sword," he said excitedly. "Look!" Encrusted with rubies, the
hilt of the dagger indeed resembled that of the Sword of Gryffindor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gryffindor's
room indeed," murmured Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"But … there
weren't any other artefacts," Harry said, staring at the dagger.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd say this
room is full of your artefacts, mate," grinned Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"And I know why
only you can Neville can communicate with the room," Hermione
announced from the doorway. The four swung to look at her. She was
clutching a piece of parchment and her cheeks were flushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Hat <em class="calibre9">gave</em>
you the Sword," she said. "The runes, they're a … a sort of
prophecy." Harry groaned audibly.</p><p class="calibre8">"We can get in
because we got the Sword?" Neville asked, his brow furrowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Only a true
Gryffindor could pull that sword from the Hat," Harry murmured,
staring at the rubies glittering on the dagger Neville still held.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you see?"
Hermione practically bounced up and down in the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not really,
Hermione," Harry sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"The runes,
listen!" Hermione backed out into the carpeted room. The others
followed. "I translated it. It's sort of like a prophecy … only
not really and not really instructions either, sort of a cross
between the two."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, what does
it say, woman?" Ron demanded and Hermione gave him a piercing look.
Ron remained unrepentant, grinning at Hermione cheerfully. She shook
her head, straightened her parchment and read. "<em class="calibre9">When two come,
true and strong, pure of heart and courage long, then shall the
secrets throng, when two hands join along</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"What the hell
does that mean?" Ron asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville and Harry
can probably reveal whatever is behind these wooden panels,"
Hermione explained.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did you get
that, Hermione?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's the
Sword," Ginny murmured. "You two are the only ones who received
the Sword. I think … I think it's like you are recognised by this
room or something."</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
something behind these panels and together Neville and Harry can open
it," Hermione said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Open it? How?"
asked Neville. Hermione shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I'm not
doing anything about it right now," Harry said decisively. "Luna
is outside on the steps waiting and I still haven't showered and
it's nearly time to eat. It's obviously been here for hundreds of
years, it can wait a few more days."</p><p class="calibre8">Neville and Harry
took the others back through the wall and soon they were all
clustered on the steep stairs. Harry looked up. The stairs no longer
vanished into darkness, he could see a landing and the six of them
trooped up and out onto the seventh floor.</p><p class="calibre8">********************</p><p class="calibre8">There was little
time for Harry and Neville to explore the hidden room in the next few
weeks. Harry and Ginny had been overseeing the conversion of Number
Twelve, Grimmauld Place into a children's home and Neville spent
every spare moment with his plants or Luna. Harry had selected a band
of hopeful first and second years who were training with him to be
ready for next year's Quidditch trials. Between all that,
schoolwork and Quidditch practice for their upcoming match against
Slytherin, time seemed to slip away faster than the sand in an
hourglass.</p><p class="calibre8">The days before
Hallowe'en seemed to fly by particularly fast until the day was
upon them. Harry felt a strange sense of peace about Hallowe'en
that he had not felt before. He supposed it was the effect of the end
of the Second War. He couldn't recall a Hallowe'en since he was
eleven when he felt only soft memories of his parents and not the
horribly grim reality that they had been murdered.</p><p class="calibre8">It was a Saturday
and the first Hogsmeade weekend but the first Quidditch game of the
year was the following weekend. Practice was higher on the agenda
than a visit to Honeydukes. After a fast and furious Quiddicth
practice that left Ginny aching after a few too many Bludgers got
sent her way, she kissed Harry thoroughly before excusing herself to
soak in a long bath, nodding to Hermione who was brooding in front of
the common room fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey, Hermione,"
Harry sat down quietly next to his best friend.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, hello,
Harry," Hermione said vaguely, staring at the flickering flames.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think …
do you think I should … that Ron and I … that is … is it a good
idea for us to … there's the next level …?" Hermione
spluttered and stopped. Her eyes pleaded with Harry to understand
what she was saying without making her say it.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was surprised.
He had assumed Ron and Hermione experienced pretty much all the
things a romantic relationship had to offer. He had not expected to
be asked this question; especially not from Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm …" he
said rather eloquently.</p><p class="calibre8">"You see, I just
was so sure that I wanted to wait and then I wasn't and, Merlin,
Harry, some of the things you can do without doing well …"
Hermione bit her lip and stared at him. Harry forced himself to look
calm. Inside his belly was churning. She couldn't be asking him
<em class="calibre9">this</em>.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think you
should write to your mum," he said weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She doesn't
<em class="calibre9">know</em> Ron," Hermione turned soulful eyes on him. "All she
said was 'Be careful'." Hermione snorted. Harry smiled. Soon
the two of them were laughing, Harry rolling about on the hearth rug
like Ron had on the day Harry had first kissed Cho Chang.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron loves you,"
Harry said when they had finally calmed down. "He has for years."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know,"
Hermione nodded. She grinned at him. "Want to go see Hagrid?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Race you,"
answered Harry and he darted out of the common room, Hermione on his
heels.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Hermione
spent most of the afternoon arguing with Hagrid over getting rid of
his Quintaped. The creature was now the size and disposition of one
of Aunt Marge's overfed bulldogs. It could stick one of its five
clubbed feet out of the steel cage Hermione had transfigured and
tried to swipe at Harry and Hermione repeatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid, you've
got to set him free," Hermione pleaded. "He's all squashed up
in there. Take him to Mr Weasley. He can let the relevant department
at the Ministry get him home."</p><p class="calibre8">"He's perfectly
fine when it's just me and him," Hagrid said stoutly. "Likes
Grawp too."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you're
giants," Hermione said exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm only half,"
Hagrid protested. Hermione rolled her eyes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Won't it attack
Arthur?" Harry said warily eyeing the monster. It flashed its
horrible teeth at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh 'e's still
jest a baby," Hagrid said, "and he's friendly like too. All
bark, no bite this one."</p><p class="calibre8">"Looks like he
could bite," Hermione muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh 'e's still
too little to be doin' anyone any real 'arm," Hagrid said
airily. "Iffen 'e bit yer, it'd be no more'n a scratch." He
dismissed Hermione's concerns with a wave of one dustbin lid sized
hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd have to
stun it to transport it," Hermione looked at the Quintaped with
some distaste.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't I jest
set 'im lose in the forest?" Hagrid pleaded. "Then 'e can
come visit."</p><p class="calibre8">"He'll find his
way to the castle, Hagrid," Hermione said exasperatedly. They
argued, at odds, on and off for hours between bucket sized cups of
tea and treacle fudge so hard it made Harry's jaw ache when he
tried to be polite.</p><p class="calibre8">"Please, Hagrid,"
Hermione pleaded as she wound a scarf around her neck and lower face.
"You've got to take him back home. He's a terrible danger to us
here."</p><p class="calibre8">"Always something
around here is a terrible danger," muttered Harry darkly as the two
of them made their way back to the castle. "It's probably been
sent here to kill me. Everything always is."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Harry," said
Hermione exasperatedly. She rolled her eyes at him. "I thought you
were done feeling gloomy on Hallowe'en?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't help it,"
Harry complained. "It's dark and creepy out here." The shadows
were lengthening over the grounds.</p><p class="calibre8">"The forest is
creepier than this!" she exclaimed, rolling her eyes at him. "You
are being melancholy. No study for you and Ginny tonight. You need a
distraction." Harry grinned at her as she marched ahead of him and
pushed the doors open and stepped into the Entrance Hall. A whole
evening with Ginny and the only price to pay was a few moments of
melancholy. It was too good to be true – but he'd take it.</p><p class="calibre8">They stayed at the
feast only long enough not to arouse suspicion. As soon as Harry had
bolted down a slice of treacle tart and Ginny had delicately eaten a
bowl of trifle they excused themselves with murmurs about studying.
They seemed to be taken at their word; only Neville hid his smile
behind his ice cream. Harry took the stairs two at a time back up to
Gryffindor Tower, Ginny hurrying to keep up.</p><p class="calibre8">She eventually
cornered him on the fifth floor landing and, draping her arms around
his neck she leaned forward to whisper in his ear. Harry stared at
her for a long moment as her words sunk in.</p><p class="calibre8">"You want to
what?" he asked weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Gryffindor
room," she said again. "I want us to go there, be … there."
It made sense, Harry mused. No one could get in except Neville. It
wasn't very cozy, though. He said as much to Ginny as she pulled
him down a flight of stairs heading for the portrait that concealed
the staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a bit …
big and … sort of ballroomy, don't you think?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ballroomy?"
Ginny arched an eyebrow at him and leapt off a moving staircase onto
the third floor landing. Harry shrugged sheepishly. "There's a
fireplace …" Ginny trailed off and Harry looked at her. She was
worrying her bottom lip with her teeth. Harry felt a sudden
tenderness sweep over him. He reached out and pulled her towards him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah in the
duelling room," he murmured against her neck, kissing her
delicately. Ginny shivered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Firelight is very
… romantic," she said breathlessly.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a
fireplace in the common room," Harry reasoned.</p><p class="calibre8">"But in the common
room … people could walk in," Ginny seemed to be holding her
breath. It hit Harry like a tonne of Bludgers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," was all he
said. Ginny reached up to kiss him then and he was lost. This woman
could have whatever she wanted as far as Harry was concerned. If she
wanted to be in front of a fire, all alone, then he had no objections
whatsoever.</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Ginny
crept back to Gryffindor Tower up the secret staircase several hours
later. Harry was Head Boy and unlikely to get a detention for being
out after curfew, but he still didn't want to run into anyone –
not looking quite as dishevelled as they currently did. The pair of
them held hands and grinned stupidly at one another. At the top of
the staircase Harry pulled Ginny to him and kissed her softly. She
wound her arms around his neck and pressed herself against him. Harry
groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop that," he
whispered. "We need to get back to the common room." Ginny pouted
at him and trailed her hands down his chest, around his waist and
under his shirt. Harry shook his head at her ruefully. If anyone ever
tried to insinuate he had taken advantage of Ginny Weasley … they'd
have it wrong.</p><p class="calibre8">"No one will miss
us," Ginny whispered back. Her hands fluttered to his belt and
Harry grabbed at them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is it too late to
get Ron to start defending <em class="calibre9">my</em> honour?" he asked against her
lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"Too late for
defending anything," Ginny giggled. Harry blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're not
telling <em class="calibre9">them</em> that, are we?" he asked her urgently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Our little
secret," Ginny promised, reaching up to give Harry a kiss. "I
<em class="calibre9">like</em> your little Gryffindor room." Her hands began
travelling over his torso.</p><p class="calibre8">"I used to hate
Hallowe'en," he murmured as he gave up any pretence of stopping
her. He had just decided to take Ginny back down the stairs and
through the mysterious wall when he heard shouting and frantic
footsteps in the corridor. Harry exchanged a look with Ginny and the
two of them raced back up the several steps they'd just come down
and burst into the corridor.</p><p class="calibre8">Instead of a
darkened, deserted corridor they saw a brightly lit scene of
pandemonium. The Fat Lady hung open at the end of the corridor and
students milled around the entrance but Harry couldn't tell if they
were trying to get in or out of the portrait hole. The portrait was
yelling obscenities at the students for unbecoming behaviour.
Professor Crockwell stood at the portrait hole remonstrating with the
Fat Lady in an ineffective manner. Hermione and Neville were
thundering towards Harry and Ginny; Dexter was screeching something
about Bart and Gerald Chumley leant against one wall his head in a
book looking bored while Crookshanks and several other pets milled
around the feet of the students.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where have you
been?" Hermione panted as she and Neville drew level with them.
"It's just awful." She grabbed his sleeve and began pulling
Harry back to the common room.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's going
on?" demanded Harry as he stumbled over his own feet when he began
hurrying back to the portrait hole at her insistence.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a
Quintaped in Gryffindor Tower!" Hermione said. Harry stopped dead
and stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"A what?" he
asked weakly. Hermione gave him a knowing look that neither of the
other two noticed.</p><p class="calibre8">"A Quintaped!"
exclaimed Neville. "I don't know how it got here but those things
are dangerous and … blimey, Harry, they're deadly!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are we going
to do?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
McGonagall's gone to fetch Hagrid," Hermione said briskly. "Let's
go and calm these students down. It can't hurt any of them –
Neville managed to lock it in the Seventh year boys' dormitory."</p><p class="calibre8">"What if it gets
out, Hermione?" Neville said looking towards the portrait hole
nervously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, didn't
you seal the door?" Hermione said as she pushed her way through the
students outside the common room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seal?" squeaked
Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"And Imperturb
it?" Hermione said, turning just before she climbed through the
portrait hole. There was a splintering sound from upstairs and a
shout.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just pulled the
door shut," Neville shouted frantically. "It hasn't got hands
to open the door-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe it doesn't
need hands!" Seamus yelled as he hurtled out of the stairwell. He
turned frantically. "DEAN!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dean's up
there?" Harry asked, horrified.</p><p class="calibre8">"He was right
behind me," Seamus said as he hurtled back to the stairwell, Harry
on his heels.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry dimly heard
Hermione and Ginny screaming at him and Neville bellowing Seamus's
name as he took the stairs two at a time. He and Seamus got to the
first landing and found Dean stumbling down the stairs, his wand
dangling from one hand and blood dripping through the fingers of his
other as he clutched his thigh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Damn thing got
me," he said through gritted teeth. "I stunned it but it took a
bit of effort. I dunno how long it'll stay down." He swayed a
little and sat down suddenly on the last step before the landing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seamus, get him
to the hospital wing," said Harry. He stepped around Dean, his wand
out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, where
d'you think you're going?" Dean asked. "It took four stunners
to take that thing down! It's a killer!"</p><p class="calibre8">"When Hagrid gets
here, send him up!" was all Harry said as he took the rest of the
steps two at a time. He ignored Seamus and Dean bellowing up at him
and kept running frantically up the stairs until he came to where the
Quintaped lay in a heap outside the sixth year dormitory.</p><p class="calibre8">Five legs twitched
feebly but it didn't move apart from that. Harry approached
cautiously. He wondered, not for the first time, how the creature
came to be here if the island it came from was Unplottable. Harry
looked around the cramped landing. It would be easier for Hagrid to
re-cage this monster downstairs and thankfully, McGonagall would make
him give it up to the Department for the Care and Control of Magical
Creatures. Harry began to levitate it downstairs.</p><p class="calibre8">He was halfway down
and manoeuvring the creature around a particularly tight corner when
it stirred. Harry looked at it warily but it still seemed to be
mostly out. If he stopped to cast a Stunner he'd probably drop it.
He just had to get down quickly. The landing he was on didn't allow
for more than a few centimetres between Harry and the splayed legs of
the hairy monster. He shuddered and screwed up his nose as the hairs
brushed his arm. He'd be glad when he got rid of this. Dean
probably deserved a medal for taking this thing out. He could hear
people calling him faintly but didn't answer them as he
concentrated on getting the Quintaped around the corner without
banging it on the wall and waking it up.</p><p class="calibre8">The next landing was
as tricky as the one before it and just before he sent the creature
straight down the flight of stairs he heard Hagrid thump into the
common room.</p><p class="calibre8">"I swear 'e were
goin' back to the Ministry on Monday," Hagrid's voice sobbed
faintly. "I didn't mean for this to 'appen."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well, be
that as it may," Professor McGonagall said stiffly. "You have
scared an entire House and injured at least one student!"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's my fault
Professor McGonagall," Hermione said. "I knew about the Quintaped
but Hagrid swore he'd look after it and he promised to send it back
when it was grown!"</p><p class="calibre8">"While it may have
been ill advised of you not to have informed another Professor,"
McGonagall's voice was clipped, "it is not your responsibility,
Miss Granger. We can only hope no more students are injured."</p><p class="calibre8">"But 'e were
locked up, Professor," Hagrid protested. "Everyone were at th'
feast. Ain't no way Monty coulda gotten inter th' Tower."</p><p class="calibre8">"Where is Mr
Potter?" Professor McGonagall sounded worried.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's up there,"
Ginny replied. She sounded more worried. "With the Quintaped."
Harry levitated the hairy beast another few steps. One landing and
the last flight to go and he could get rid of this thing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Step back," he
called, his voice wavering with the strain of maintaining the
levitation in such a cramped area. "This thing is coming first."
He grimaced as he bumped the Quintaped into a wall and then stumbled
into it. One of the legs waved ominously. Harry held his breath and
concentrated on just getting the Quintaped the last few metres and
then never seeing the thing again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, are you
all right?" Ginny called.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, just …
I'm nearly-"</p><p class="calibre8">" 'Arry! I'm
sorry 'bout that, Monty were secured before I came up!" Hagrid
practically bellowed.</p><p class="calibre8">It all happened so
fast, the Quintaped roused itself when it heard Hagrid's voice and
began to thrash violently. Harry jumped out of the way of one clubbed
foot but his levitation spell was wavering badly and the Quintaped
swung towards him, its eyes had flickered open and razor sharp teeth
were flashing dangerously. Harry had next to no chance in the tiny
stairwell and although he tried to jump out of the way a flailing
club-foot caught him on the chest and Harry slipped down several
steps.</p><p class="calibre8">With an anguished
cry his concentration broke and the Quintaped came crashing down on
him. Harry threw his arms up to shield his face and a glimpse of
sharp teeth dripping with saliva was the last thing he saw before his
head hit a stone step and blackness descended upon him.</p><p class="calibre8">**************</p><p class="calibre8">When Harry awoke his
left arm and shoulder were on fire and a herd of Hippogriffs were
stampeding through his head. Something wet and sticky covered his
neck and he felt as if he were slowly floating away. He didn't want
to go, he wasn't supposed to go. When someone grasped his hand, he
held on tight as if he were holding a lifeline. He thought he heard
someone whisper that they wouldn't let him go but he couldn't be
sure because the pain was unbearable, like a siren screaming through
his brain and he couldn't hear anything but his own thudding
heartbeat pounding along with the herd of Hippogriffs and the sirens
of pain.</p><p class="calibre8">He couldn't be
dying; it didn't hurt this much to die.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry gripped the
hand holding his own and concentrated on staying alive. He almost
laughed to himself. How did you concentrate on staying alive anyway?
Now ironically, dying was something he knew how to concentrate on.
The pain began to recede and the grip on his hand seemed to loosen
and hysteria welled up inside him, was he dying now? He had to see
Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny …"
Harry whispered. It hurt to talk, it hurt to breathe.</p><p class="calibre8">The world came into
sharp focus right before the blackness claimed him again. He could
hear Hermione whisper softly. He heard Hagrid weeping and Professor
McGonagall speaking briskly, coldly. He felt gentle hands on his arm
and neck and he saw Ginny hovering over him; she brushed his hair
from his face gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hang in there,
Harry," she pleaded as his eyes slid shut against his will. "Madame
Pomfrey's coming; just please, hang on."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry squeezed her
hand again and let the blackness claim him. It was easier that way.</p><p class="calibre8">**************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry could hear
whispering. He moved experimentally. The back of his head still
throbbed but the herd of Hippogriffs had gone. His left arm and
shoulder tingled but there was no more burning sensation. He reached
up to touch his neck; a bandage replaced the wet, sticky coating. He
opened his eyes tentatively. The whispering had stopped, now there
was rustling. He was in the hospital wing and only one lamp lit the
small space around his bed. A small space that was crammed with
people.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?" Ginny
was hovering over him just as she had been when he closed his eyes.
He opened his mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"How are you
feeling, son?" Arthur enquired. He was standing on the other side
of Harry's bed with Molly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Awful," Harry
admitted ruefully with a painful cough. "What … happened?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't try to
talk, dear," Molly said. She smoothed the blankets across his chest
and stroked his cheek tenderly.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Quintaped got
you," said Ginny, her voice wavering slightly. "But you're fine
now. You're going to be fine."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid?" Harry
croaked. Ginny frowned slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He … he's
really sorry," Hermione's voice came from behind Ginny. "He
didn't break any regulations so he's not in any legal trouble."
Ginny's face clouded over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not in any
trouble?" Molly huffed. "I'll show him some trouble. Fancy
having that … that thing near a school! He's going to hear a few
things from me! If he thinks he's not in trouble for nearly killing
one of <em class="calibre9">my</em> children, he can think again!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well he is in an
awful lot of trouble with Professor McGonagall," Hermione allowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I should think
so!" Molly exclaimed. "I honestly don't know what he was
thinking! How did it get so far into the castle? That's what I'd
like to know."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a good
thing no one was in that dorm," Ron said as he peered over Ginny's
shoulder. "Neville said he thought you were, at first. You and
Ginny left the feast early and he couldn't find you, thought you
had gone upstairs." Harry met Ginny's eyes and noticed the faint
blush on her cheeks, but no one commented on where they had been.</p><p class="calibre8">"Someone had to
let it in," George said suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"The password,"
Percy murmured. Was the whole family there?</p><p class="calibre8">"Well that's
fairly obvious, isn't it?" Ron said sarcastically. "Or do you
think dangerous creatures with a taste for human flesh routinely roam
the castle and Gryffindor Tower?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who would want to
let one into the Tower?" Percy asked. He was pacing at the foot of
the bed. "How'd Hagrid get a Quintaped anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Down the pub,"
Ron said bitterly, "where he gets everything."</p><p class="calibre8">"S'not Hagrid's
fault," Harry said, breathing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, it's mine,"
Hermione wailed suddenly and Harry heard her flee in a flurry of
footsteps. The doors of the hospital wing crashed open and Ron
muttered a hasty apology and vanished. Harry closed his eyes and
willed everyone else to go away.</p><p class="calibre8">"We need to go,"
Arthur said quietly. "Let you get some sleep."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks …"
Harry breathed, "for … for coming." The Weasleys murmured their
goodbyes and left the room quietly and Harry let out a sigh and
groaned at an unexpected pain that shot through his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry? Are you in
pain?" Ginny asked. Harry opened his eyes swiftly. He thought she'd
gone and that he was alone. It was the only reason he'd groaned. He
stared at Ginny wide eyed for a moment. She stared back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can get Madame
Pomfrey," Ginny said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No … that's
okay," Harry said, knowing that if she fetched the matron she would
also be sent away. He suddenly wanted her to stay very badly. "Stay."
He couldn't reach for her, his arm felt like lead but she seemed to
know what he wanted and pulled a chair close to the bed and pulled
his hand into her own before kissing his cheek and sitting down.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's late,"
she whispered. "Get some sleep." Harry closed his eyes and leaned
into her touch as she began smoothing the hair back from his face
tenderly. He only had a vague idea what was going on but somehow,
everything felt right with the world.</p>
