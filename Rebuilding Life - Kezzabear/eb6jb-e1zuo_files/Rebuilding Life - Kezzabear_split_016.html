<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_17">*Chapter 16*: Chapter 16</h2>
			<p class="calibre8">A/N: I
haven't left any before now because I always forget but I thought I
should stop, say hi and let you know that I am glad those of you
still with me here are enjoying the story. (I'm assuming you do
since you are still here :P ) Some people have said "Why send them
to Australia?" Well partly because the scenes in my head wouldn't
go away and partly because I wanted to use the fabulous back drop of
my homeland for some of the themes in my story. I hope you enjoy the
brief sojourn DownUnder :D .</p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Somewhere
Over the Rainbow</strong></p><p class="calibre8">When
Harry and Mr Weasley re entered the house they found George sitting
quietly at the kitchen table. He looked up when they came in and his
eyes found Harry's.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,
mate," he said, without hesitation. "I shouldn't have made any
of that my business." Harry shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
Ginny you need to apologise to."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know, I already have," replied George. Harry smiled and Arthur
patted him on the back before leaving the room and heading up the
stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then
we don't have a problem," Harry said to George, sitting at the
table. "How are the renovations to the shop going? Are you on track
to reopen as soon as we get back?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure
are," said George enthusiastically. "Ron's brilliant with
planning this sort of stuff. He's even got a few good product
ideas!"</p><p class="calibre8">"He
surprises you sometimes, doesn't he?" laughed Harry. "Hey, can
I come and help, you know … if you need it, when you reopen?"
George looked at him in surprise and raised an eyebrow in question.
Harry looked at the table and began tracing the grain of the wood
with one finger.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
just want to spend some time with Ron, you know?" Harry looked up.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
that's why you haven't moved into Percy's room?" asked
George. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"We've
never spent more than a few weeks apart since we were eleven. That
fight we had over the tournament in fourth year was torture. I'm
going to miss him while I'm at Hogwarts," said Harry, looking
back down at the table. "I reckon I've spent enough nights
sleeping alone in my own room."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
it is hard," said George distantly, "sleeping alone. I've never
slept alone before." Harry didn't know what to say to that. He
would miss Ron for a while, but George had lost his best friend and
roommate forever. The two of them sat in silence until Ron came
clattering in about five minutes later. He looked a little flushed
and his hair was so rumpled it was messier than Harry's.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello
chaps!" he said enthusiastically as he headed to the pantry to
retrieve something to eat. "Isn't it a beautiful evening?"
George looked at Harry and smirked. Harry felt the undeniable urge to
<em class="calibre9">giggle</em> and suppressed it quickly.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
how is Hermione, Ron?" asked George, a sly smile on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,"
breathed Ron as he poured a glass of pumpkin juice, "she's
brilliant." The pumpkin juice overflowed the glass and poured over
the table. Ron shook his head and lazily cleaned the spill up with
his wand before sitting at the table and taking a swig before sighing
dramatically. George and Harry watched him barely suppressing smirks.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
you've had a good evening then, Ron?" asked Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
Ron smiled distantly, "you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
I did actually," said Harry, smiling faintly. Ron suddenly sobered
and looked at Harry critically.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
didn't dad drag you into his shed for a … <em class="calibre9">chat</em>?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
he did," said Harry, perplexed.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
this chat did not bother you?" enquired George with a frown. Harry
shook his head, puzzled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
would it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"He
didn't give you dire warnings about respecting our baby sister's
honour and keeping certain … things to yourself?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Or
an embarrassingly detailed talk about how women think and, er …
function?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
said Harry slowly looking at both of them with raised eyebrows.
George and Ron looked at each other before Ron turned to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
what <em class="calibre9">did</em> he say?" Harry smiled and stood up, heading for the
door.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
women are smarter than us," he tossed over his shoulder as he
headed for the hallway and up the stairs. He didn't get very far
before he heard Ron and George thumping after him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dad
said that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Among
other things," replied Harry. "If you two leave me alone long
enough for me to say goodnight to Ginny, I might be more specific."
They had reached the second landing now and Harry knocked on Ginny's
door. She poked her head out a few seconds later and then squawked
and slammed the door in his face. Harry stared at the door in
confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
did not say <em class="calibre9">anything</em> that explains <em class="calibre9">that</em>, however."
Ginny opened the door a few moments later.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,"
she said breathlessly. "I wasn't decent." Harry wound his arms
around her waist, pulling her close and leant forward to whisper in
her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
wouldn't have minded."</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
not, but they would have," said Ginny nodding towards Ron and
George who were still standing on the landing behind Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
just wanted to say goodnight," explained Harry. "If they want to
watch …" and he bent his head and kissed her. Knowing her back
was to her door and therefore not in view of her brothers, Harry let
his hands drift downwards as they kissed. He could feel Ginny smile
against his mouth but he felt alarmed when he realised her hands were
heading to the corresponding area of his body, and his back was in
full view of her brothers. He pulled away sharply and she giggled.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
really don't need to see this," decided Ron loudly. "I'll see
you upstairs mate." Harry turned to see Ron's retreating back and
George standing there smirking at them. Suddenly George's face fell
and he stammered something about going to bed and he too vanished up
the stairs. Turning back to Ginny Harry noticed she was putting her
wand away. He shook his head a smile playing across his lips. It
seemed George had forgotten she wasn't of age and couldn't use
that wand in any case.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now,
where were we," murmured Ginny as she reached up and pulled his
head down to hers.</p><p class="calibre8">When
Harry arrived back in his and Ron's room some ten minutes later he
found both Ron and George waiting for him. Harry, knowing his hair
was likely messier than usual, attempted to smooth it down, the whole
time knowing he was fighting a losing battle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Give
it up, Potter," said Ron from his supine position on his bed. "We
know what you've been up to, apparently with the all clear from our
father." Ron was looking at Harry with an expression halfway
between amusement and outrage. Harry just shook his head and pulled
his shirt over his head, rummaging about for his pyjamas in the pile
of clothes next to his bed. George had made himself comfortable on
Harry's bed and was now looking quizzically at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seriously,
what did Dad say?" asked George. Harry thought for a moment before
replying.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
said he advised all his sons to wait for marriage, but that he's
not my father," Harry grinned waiting for their reaction. What Ron
actually said surprised and annoyed him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
then, you're just lucky! I got an entire father-son lecture about
respecting women and their bodies and waiting was more than <em class="calibre9">advice</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Lucky?"
asked Harry hollowly. He could see George from the corner of his eye
sit up abruptly. "You really think it's lucky that my father
isn't around to talk to me about stuff like this? To give me his
advice?" Ron was still lying on his bed, hands linked behind his
head, looking at the ceiling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
it's embarrassing …" shuddered Ron. Harry just stared at Ron
before abruptly turning and yanking the door open and walking out
onto the landing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
it's real lucky that I have no idea what my Dad would have said
about it, that I can't ask<em class="calibre9"> him </em>about intimacy and feelings
and what to do with the rest of my life," shouted Harry as he stood
trembling, shirtless, his pyjama top hanging from his left hand, on
the landing. Ron sprang out of the bed and started towards him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't mean-" Harry just shook his head fiercely and thundered
down the stairs. He could hear George calling Ron an 'insensitive
git' as they scrambled down the stairs after him. He dimly heard
Ron answer that it wasn't the first time and Harry remembered the
awful words they'd had over pretty much the very same thing last
year. The hatred he'd felt then seemed to surge back and he wanted
to get as far away from Ron as possible. Harry landed with a thump on
the second landing having leapt down the last few steps and Ginny's
door flew open but he paid her no heed as he yanked open Percy's
door, stepped inside and slammed it behind him with a satisfying
bang. It banged open, hitting the wall, only seconds later. Harry
spun around to see Ron standing in the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
go away, Ron," shouted Harry. "Just leave me alone!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,
I'm sorry. It just came out all wrong. Of course I don't think
that's lucky."</p><p class="calibre8">Then
Mrs Weasley was there telling them to keep it down. At the same time
George was telling Ron he had a gift for saying stupid things. Ginny
was standing, wide eyed, in her bedroom doorway. Harry glared at Ron,
his arms crossed. Hermione had her wand out, ready to throw a shield
between them.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think that's lucky," Ron repeated softly. "I'm
sorry." Harry relaxed a little, dropping his arms and sighing. Ron
grinned at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"In
fact I'd think it was the end of the world if I'd just had that
chat with <em class="calibre9">Hermione's dad</em>," he said. Harry regarded him for
a moment before he burst out laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
was really great about it, Ron," said Harry. "I just wish things
were different sometimes." Harry noticed that Arthur had joined the
rest of the family on the landing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Everything
alright, boys?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
everything's great, thanks Dad," said Harry and Arthur beamed at
him. Ron gave him an odd sort of look but Harry had no time to ask
him about it because Ginny pushed her way past Ron and her father and
into the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
happened?" she asked as she reached him and raised a hand to trace
the oval shaped scar near his heart. Harry suddenly realised he was
standing there, shirtless, something he had steadfastly avoided, even
while swimming. His pyjama top was in his hand and he hurriedly
started to pull it over his head. Ginny was still looking at him
steadily when his head emerged from the neck of the pyjama top. Harry
sighed inwardly. He looked at Hermione who looked worried and was
biting her lip.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a long story," he replied, avoiding Ginny's gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
give me the short version," she said. Harry looked at her then and
she was looking at him with a mixture of understanding and
expectation. He remembered his own vow that he would share everything
with her and he knew that this was more important, more precious to
her than access to his vault. He took a deep breath and looked at
Hermione who nodded imperceptibly as if encouraging him.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was from a … battle I suppose you'd call it," he started, "with
Voldemort's snake, at Christmas. I was wearing a locket that he'd
made a Horcrux out of and it … well I guess you could say it put up
a bit of a fight when the snake tried to sort of strangle me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sort
of?" questioned Hermione, eyebrows raised, "you have a terrible
habit of down playing things, Harry." He just looked at her and
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
just lucky it's the only scar I've got from trying to destroy one
of those things," he said. He felt decidedly odd standing in
Percy's old bedroom in his jeans and pyjama top discussing
Horcruxes casually with Hermione. "I'm lucky I'm not dead."
He said it so bluntly that Ginny winced and he cursed himself
inwardly and reached out for her. As he pulled her into his arms she
wound her own arms around his neck and clung to him tightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
you think about it, you only did destroy one anyway," mused Ron,
heedless of their audience and his sister still hanging from Harry's
neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
that just proves I didn't need to do it alone, doesn't it?"
Harry said as he realised he'd not actually spoken of many of the
past year's activities since they'd come home. He wondered how
many questions everyone had been dying to ask him and suddenly felt
an overwhelming gratitude that they had refrained. Arthur cleared his
throat. He seemed hesitant.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
destroyed the other ones then?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron,
Hermione, Professor Dumbledore, Neville …" Harry trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
had five?" asked Arthur faintly. Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
seven, although he didn't mean to make seven, he meant to make
six," answered Harry, stroking Ginny's back. He continued
softly. "I suppose you'd say Crabbe died destroying one.
Professor Dumbledore was killed by one."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
still only six. Who destroyed the seventh?" asked Mrs Weasley
hesitantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
er … he did," answered Harry hesitantly. Taking a deep breath he
looked directly at her. "When he tried to kill me, he destroyed
it." Mrs Weasley went white as she realised the implications and
her eyes flicked up to the scar on his forehead. "The only one I
destroyed was his diary and that was pure dumb luck. That one was
actively trying to kill <em class="calibre9">me</em> and if it hadn't been for Fawkes
…" Harry felt Ginny stiffen in his arms and he trailed off,
tightening his arms around her. She fought him for only a moment
before he felt her slump into him and her tears wet his neck. An
oppressive silence hung over the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
this is an odd time for this all to come out," remarked Ron
eventually. It was punctuated by a loud sob from Ginny. Harry didn't
notice as they all withdrew and he cradled Ginny in his arms as he
sank onto Percy's old bed and held her while she cried.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
okay, I'm still here. It wasn't your fault," he murmured into
her hair as her sobs subsided. She still clung to his neck like a
limpet, quite uncharacteristically. He shifted uneasily as she
quietened and stilled. Suddenly she spoke, whispering into the
stillness.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know. I try not to think about it. I don't like to think about you
hurt or dying," she said. "And last year, at school … I didn't
know where you were or how you were … I mean I knew you were in
danger but … I'm sorry. I guess I got a little overwhelmed."
She pulled away from him abruptly and stood up, wiping the tears from
her cheeks and pretending she hadn't just broken down in his arms.
Harry reached out and took her hand, pulling her back to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell
me about last year," he said softly. "I used to think about
Hogwarts. I used wonder what it would be like to be there, tucked up
in a nice warm bed, having dinner in the Great Hall. To be with you.
I would get out the map and watch your name. Willing you to know I
was thinking of you, hoping you were all right. But it wasn't as
simple as that, was it?" Ginny shook her head. She seemed to be
considering something.</p><p class="calibre8">"At
first it was a bit of an adventure," she admitted as she wandered
to look out of the tiny window. "It wasn't too bad before
Christmas and I had Neville and Luna. Neville told you we reformed
Dumbledore's Army together?" Harry nodded, sensing more
understatement, then realised she was looking out of the window and
couldn't see him so he got up and slid his arms around her waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
we heard things along the way and Neville told us some of what you'd
all been up to," he said softly. "It didn't sound anything like
being tucked up in nice safe beds."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
no, we kept getting out of bed," mused Ginny and Harry chuckled as
she turned in his arms. "I wish I'd had a map I could have seen
your name on, so I would have known you were safe. I used to throw
myself into all the things we planned to I wouldn't have to think
about how you might be …" She stopped, staring distantly over his
shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I knew where you were and I knew you were alive but I didn't know
how you were," said Harry, stroking her hair. "Later Neville told
us matter-of-factly that being pure blood meant they only hurt you,
not kill you. It was, quite frankly, disturbing." Ginny laughed a
short, sharp laugh. It sounded harsh in the stillness of the night.</p><p class="calibre8">"Some
days I don't know how I am going to go back," she admitted. "It
was horrible and there were days I thought Snape had it in for me
specifically. He saw me looking at a picture of us once and he went
nuts. It was weird actually."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
have a picture of us?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
Colin took it once when we weren't looking. We were sitting
outside, near the lake," she smiled. "He sent me a copy for my
birthday. Hang on." Ginny scurried out of the room and returned
moments later with a dog eared photograph that showed the two of them
sitting close under a tree. As he watched himself bend his head down
and press a kiss to Ginny's lips, Harry realised that this was the
same tree under which his father had taunted Snape when they were
fifteen.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
saw that and just went nuts. I got three week's worth of detentions
for looking at something that wasn't a text book on school
grounds," said Ginny. "Normally he sent me to Hagrid for
detentions. Not this time. I always wondered if he had something
against the two of us. He seemed to really hate seeing us together,
remember he gave you all those detentions when we started going out?"
Harry nodded absently, watching as his photo self gave photo Ginny
another kiss. He didn't miss the fact that Ginny did not reveal
what her detention was but he didn't think now was the right time
to ask about it. As he watched the photograph it struck him how much
they looked like his parents when he could no longer see their faces
clearly and suddenly he knew why Snape had snapped on seeing the
photo.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
wasn't seeing us," said Harry softly as he handed her the photo.
"He never saw me. He always saw my dad. He was watching my dad
steal my mum away from him." Ginny contemplated the photo for a
moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"That
makes sense," she murmured. "It wasn't safe at Hogwarts
anymore. I'm worried I won't feel safe when we go back. I worry
that memories will make it seem unfriendly; which is stupid." She
grimaced and Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not stupid," he said as he pulled her into a hug. "But I'll be
there, I promise. We can make new memories … all over the castle."
And he bent his head to kiss her. Only a few moments later, and much
too soon in Harry's opinion, she pulled away and looked up at him,
her eyes once again twinkling with concealed mischief.</p><p class="calibre8">"So …
you had a chat with Dad?" Harry grinned at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
he said, "yes I did. It was most … illuminating." She cocked
her head to one side and studied him intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"In
what way was it illuminating, exactly?" Harry's smile softened
and put his hand up to caress her cheek as he looked at her. She
closed her eyes and turned her face to nuzzle the palm of his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think he was warning me that you would try and seduce me," he
whispered. Ginny's eyes shot open in shock and her jaw fell open.
Harry chuckled at her expression. He trailed his hand down her neck,
across her shoulder and down her arm. He then moved to her hip,
letting his hand drift lower until his gentle pressure urged her to
press her body towards his own. His other hand wandered up her back
and he pulled her lips to his to capture her them in another kiss. As
he pulled away he said, ever so softly,</p><p class="calibre8">"He
needn't have worried – I have a very strong will." Harry
released Ginny then and she stumbled back a step, her eyes flew open
and with her hair mussed, lips swollen and face flushed and Harry
wondered for a moment just how strong his will actually was.</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodnight,
Ginevra Weasley," he said as he backed towards the door. Her full
name seemed to bring her out of her trance and as she looked at him
Harry looked back steadily. "I love you." He saw her smile as he
went around the corner and up the staircase and he suddenly felt
euphoric. He bounded up the stairs and threw open the door to the
tiny bedroom under the attic. Ron was sitting in his bed, reading a
Quidditch magazine and he looked up as Harry stood there. Ron smirked
at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hello,
Ron! Isn't it a beautiful evening?"</p><p class="calibre8">"And
how is Ginny, Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,"
breathed Harry as he flopped onto his own bed, "she's brilliant!"
And they both laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">************************</p><p class="calibre8">Mrs
Weasley seemed very teary the next morning at breakfast as she piled
their plates high with bacon, eggs, sausages and toast but none of
them paid a lot of attention as they raced through their breakfast
and prepared to leave for the day. Harry was planning to visit Teddy
before he went to Australia. George and Ron were going to do some
final work in the shop before they left the next morning and Hermione
and Ginny would join them there after they went to the bank. They all
tried to get Harry to come to the shop after he visited Teddy but
were met with steadfast refusal. Harry was quite willing to leave
random public appearances in London's wizarding heart until they
came home again. Although the shop would not be open to the public,
it had very large windows.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
paid no attention to Mrs Weasley's teary state because she was
fretting about the morning mail. The Owls had not brought their
Hogwarts letters and Hermione would have to wait until she returned
home to receive it. As Harry watched the other four Floo into number
ninety-three Diagon Alley, Mrs Weasley piled his plate higher with
more breakfast than he could possibly eat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,
Mum," he said absently as he read the front page of the paper that
Arthur was holding up and stabbed a piece of sausage with his fork.
The sausage never made it to Harry's mouth however, because he
found himself engulfed in one of Mrs Weasley's rib-cracking hugs.
His breathing became laboured and his hand was jutting out at an
uncomfortable angle and he struggled to hold his fork so that it
would not poke him in the eye.</p><p class="calibre8">"Molly,
let the boy go so he can breathe," said Arthur, not removing his
eyes from the paper. Mrs Weasley let him go and he stuffed the
sausage piece into his mouth hurriedly, wondering what he'd done to
warrant the affectionate assault as Mrs Weasley busied herself
washing the dishes. Arthur lowered the paper fractionally and peered
over the top at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
likes it when you say that," he supplied quietly. Harry merely
looked at him in confusion. He thought back and tried to work out
what he'd said. "She wouldn't mind Molly, but … I don't
think you realise that sometimes you call her Mum." Harry shook his
head. He hadn't realised that at all. He watched as Mrs Weasley
directed the dishes and plates with her wand. He suddenly realised he
<em class="calibre9">wanted</em> to call her Mum and knew with a certainty that his own
mother would not mind, in the same way he had known his father would
not have minded. Harry smiled at Arthur as he pushed his chair back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
going over to see Teddy now," Harry announced. He grabbed a piece
of toast from his plate and went to the back door. He paused and
crossed the kitchen in only a few steps to give Mrs Weasley – Molly
a kiss on the cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
for breakfast, Mum," he said and watched her eyes light up before
he banged out the door and bounded into the garden to Apparate to
Andromeda's.</p><p class="calibre8">The
next morning Molly's tears were even more pronounced as she fussed
over them prior to their departure. Harry was irresistibly reminded
of their departure for the World Cup in the summer before Fourth
Year. Molly even asked George if he had anything that he shouldn't
take into another country in his pockets. She did resist doing a
summoning spell on him this time and when George left he did so after
giving his mother a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Molly hugged Harry
and then pulled her daughter into a fierce embrace.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't believe you'll be all grown up next time I see you!" she
wailed into Ginny's shoulder. "You'll be of age and my baby
will be gone!" Ginny patted her mother awkwardly on the shoulder,
refraining from saying that she was already all grown up, wasn't a
baby and hadn't been for some time, but somehow Harry knew that's
what she was thinking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
worry, I'll always be your baby, mum," she said instead as her
mother released her.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
right," sniffed Molly. "So don't you dare go off and get
married or anything silly just because you can!" Ginny blushed
tomato red as her mother glared at her. Harry put his arm around
Ginny's shoulders and leaned in to press a kiss to Molly's cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
wouldn't dare, Mum," said Harry. He grinned at Molly cheekily. "I
wouldn't dare."</p><p class="calibre8">***************************</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
on earth is this place a mess?" exclaimed Ron as they arrived by
Portkey at the designated point, concealed by Muggle repelling
charms, in Sydney International Airport. Looking through the large
windows that surrounded them Harry saw that there was a lot of
building machinery and more than one massive scaffold. Cranes wobbled
precariously overhead and half finished buildings rose into the sky,
planes appeared to dodge them as they circled the airport.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd
think, if they call this place the showcase of Australia, the
Muggles'd tidy it up a bit!"</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
building it Ronald," Hermione sighed exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
how is that safe for the Muggles? It's not as if planes aren't
dangerous enough without knowing how they stay up and all but they
have to try and drop them out of the sky into this mess?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Planes
don't drop out of the sky, Ron," said Hermione, less than
patiently. "Planes land." Hurriedly showing their paperwork to
the rather bored witch manning the International Portkey desk
Hermione led Ron over to a window and began pointing out the runways
and attempted to explain that the planes used these to gather and
reduce speed when leaving or returning to earth. George, Harry and
Ginny showed their own paperwork to the witch and joined them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
does it look like this then?" George asked curiously. "It is a
bit messy. Bit like my bedroom after an experiment gone wrong, things
sticking up at angles all over the place!" Hermione turned from the
window where Ron was watching, fascinated as planes landed.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
making it bigger, for the Olympics."</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Olly-whats?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But
Hermione they're two years away!" said Ginny incredulously.
"They've started a bit early don't you think?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Takes
a long time to build things the Muggle way," said Harry
matter-of-factly as he joined Ron at the window of the nearest gate.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't believe they aren't falling out of the sky!" Ron
marveled.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
am I, actually," said Hermione peering out into the gloom. "That's
one nasty storm out there." The five of them watched as tiny people
hurried about on the runway below, buffeted by the wind, pulling bags
and suitcases from the belly of the plane below. Rain lashed the
windows and the grey world outside looked incredibly uninviting.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oooh
this is a lovely place for a honeymoon," muttered Bill
sarcastically as he and Fleur approached from behind them.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
took you two so long?" Ron demanded. "We've been here for
ages!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Never
you mind!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Thees
ees our 'oneymoon Ronald," said Fleur. "I zink you can make up
your own mind." She grinned mischievously at them and George
groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
do <em class="calibre9">not</em>
need to hear <em class="calibre9">that</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Right,"
said Bill, "I think we have more pressing matters to attend to at
the moment. For one thing, how do we get out of this maze? And then
where do we go, Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
the best way would be the train station, straight to the city, only
they are a bit behind and haven't finished the train station yet,
so we will have to find the bus and catch that," she mused.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
it anything like the Knight Bus?" shuddered Ron. Hermione shook her
head exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
Muggles Ron, they drive a little more sedately than Ernie!" However
the bus proved difficult to board with such a large group as the
weather had caused more than one delay and had resulted in the
baggage handlers walking off the job due to hazardous conditions. The
Airport was packed with weary travelers wondering when they would be
able to reclaim their luggage and eventually crowding onto the
shuttle buses, without their luggage, in order to get home that
night. There was no room for a party of seven with copious amounts of
luggage.</p><p class="calibre8">The
group watched as a glum looking Muggle climbed into the last seat on
the third bus they'd tried to board. She appeared to be talking to
herself until Hermione pointed out that she had a mobile telephone
attached to the opposite side of her head with the hand she was not
waving wildly in the air.</p><p class="calibre8">They'd
have been dead useful over the past year," Ron commented. "It's
a pity they wouldn't work around magic." Harry thought Ron might
have a point but he was too wet and miserable to care. He huddled
into his coat miserably.</p><p class="calibre8">Abandoning
the Shuttle bus idea Bill finally flagged down two taxis with a few
Muggle repelling charms. The fight for taxis was worse than the fight
to get onto the Shuttle Buses but they were a lot easier to cast the
charms on. The taxi drivers proved to be quite equal to Ernie's
driving skill and Ron hopped out at their destination looking
decidedly green. They huddled next to a nearby building, which had an
overhanging porch above the doorway, in order to remain dry, while
Bill paid the taxi drivers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where
are we?" asked George looking up at the tall buildings, many of
which were covered in flashing lights or other brightly glowing
signs. Night had fallen and the grey skies and smoky looking
landscape had given way to sparkling lights on an inky backdrop, the
lights of the city reflecting in the rain that was still splashing
down and coating the buildings and roads.</p><p class="calibre8">"George
Street," Hermione said absently while consulting a notebook she had
pulled from her handbag.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
realise that we are on a street Hermione. I was wondering more
precisely which one and what are we doing here?" George rolled his
eyes. Hermione looked up exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
are standing on George Street," she said. "George, the name of
the street is George Street. It's Sydney's main thoroughfare and
quite possibly the first street in Sydney, being one of the first two
main tracks that led through the settlement. It used to be called
High Street as in the best British tradition, but it was obviously
formally named at a later date. It runs from near the Harbour Bridge
through the city to the south end of Sydney and connects to feeder
roads out into the Western suburbs-"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
read a book about Sydney," muttered Ron. Hermione continued as
though he had not spoken</p><p class="calibre8">"-
and it happens to run between Sydney's main wizarding locations at
Chinatown and The Rocks."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
where are we off to then, Hermione?" asked Bill as he joined them,
shaking the rain from his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
according to the notes I wrote down there should be a wizarding pub
here somewhere. It's called The Dripping Bucket, if any of you can
see it through this rain that would be fantastic," Hermione said.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Dripping Bucket?" scoffed Ron incredulously. "Who calls a pub
that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"British
wizards trying to recreate home on foreign soil I expect, Ronald,"
she responded tartly. "It's not like I named the pub, is it? I am
just trying to get us out of this rain and somewhere to stay."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
found it," interrupted Ginny. Harry looked to where she was
pointing across the street. A small door was wedged in between two
office buildings. As his eyes lingered on the door he could make out
the sign proclaiming it as The Dripping Bucket swinging in the waning
wind.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
go then," Harry said, collecting his bag and braving the rain still
pelting down from the heavens. The group dashed across the busy
street and spilled through the door to The Dripping Bucket, pushing
their way inside to escape the freezing droplets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey,
shut the bloody door behin' ya, Blue!" the voice of the barman
rang out across the crowded pub, in a lazy drawl. George hastily
wedged the door shut behind him. "I know this pub is called The
Drippin' Bucket, but no need to flood the place! I'm flat out
trying to run this place without you makin' more work for me!"</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
looking for somewhere to stay, can you recommend somewhere?"
Hermione asked him after she made her way to the bar. "Do you have
any rooms?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah,
we don't got any rooms anymore. No one stays in pubs anymore. Got a
nightclub upstairs, but," the barman replied. He was blonde with a
thick neck and an even tan. "You wanna go through into Origin Alley
there's a hotel in there and
they'll be able to put you up, bound to have room this time of
year."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
if you could just tell us how to get through to Origin Alley?"
Hermione asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Youse're
definitely not from around 'ere are youse? Everyone knows how to
get into Origin Alley!" the man looked incredulous. "Well you
just go through the back door there, there's a paintin' in front
of you and you gotta tap the yellow dots. Just tap 'em with ya wand
starting at the top and work your way down. It'll roll up and let
ya through. Hotel's about four doors down on ya right."</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
thanked the man as they traipsed out the back door in search of the
painting.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
aren't very original this lot, are they?' said Ron. "If it
wasn't for the freezing rain in August and that weird voice we may
as well be back home going through The Leaky Cauldron!"</p><p class="calibre8">"A
lot of things are going to look British, Ronald," said Hermione.
"It was settled by the British, remember?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
well I expected it to be a lot less like home, you know?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think you've got your wish Ron," said Ginny as they came face to
face with a massive canvas which was covered in swirls and dots.</p><p class="calibre8">"Blimey!"
Ron muttered. The painting was nothing like anything back home at
all. Stretching at least six feet tall and four feet wide, the canvas
was covered in tiny dots arranged to form the picture of a giant
snake. Most of the dots were white, black or a murky colour that was
a cross between red and brown but weaving down the centre was a trail
of yellow dots. Bill got out his wand and tapped each of the yellow
dots in turn and the snake's head, which was at the bottom of the
painting, twisted around to look at them before slithering a few
centimeters towards the edge of the canvas and suddenly the painting
was rolling itself up, exposing the trunk of a massive tree, set into
the wall behind the pub.</p><p class="calibre8">The
tree was at about four feet wide; grey and satiny smooth and Hermione
concluded that it was no longer alive at all and it had obviously
been sufficiently massive with a root system so deep that they had
simply built the wall, years and years ago, on either side of it,
without removing it. The trunk of the tree had a rather large gap in
it, tall enough and wide enough for a person to enter. As they went
through the gap in the trunk one by one they realised they were
standing inside the tree trunk. Another gap in the opposite side of
the trunk led the way to a sparkling hive of night time activity
beyond.</p><p class="calibre8">Entranced,
Harry stepped out from the shelter of the old, hollow tree trunk, the
others followed him. Hermione pointed out the hotel a short way down
the Alley and they headed towards it. There were still a number of
wizards and witches out on the streets and it looked as though a
thriving restaurant district was next to the hotel, there were people
heading down a tiny alleyway filled to overflowing with a bustling
crowd. The sides were lined with food vendors and the enticing smells
drifted out and swirled around them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cor,
the food smells all right, doesn't it?" said Ron, entirely
predictably. Hermione shook her head at him while Harry bit the
inside of his cheek to stop the laughter bubbling up from inside.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
need to check in first, Ronald," Hermione said imperiously. "Must
you always think about food?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
said Ron immediately as Hermione dragged him away from the entrance
to the enticing alley and into the foyer of the hotel. The splendor
of the hotel was entirely ruined by the sideshow being carried on
behind the check-in desk. There were two men there, dressed in
immaculate matching robes that carried the hotel's insignia, having
a very loud argument in strident tones.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
tellin' ya mate, all I said to 'im woz 'Aveagoodweegend', how
can anyone possibly find that offensive?"</p><p class="calibre8">"The
man was going to a funeral, you drongo!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dead
set?" asked the first man faintly. "No wonder he spit the dummy
at me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
well, you're lucky he didn't draw his wand on ya! Ya great
galah!" The first man had apparently noticed them and imperceptibly
straightened his collar and seemed to put on a new, professional face
as he greeted them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
evening," he intoned in a low, measured voice. "How can we be of
assistance this evening?" Hermione looked at Bill who stepped up
and spoke to the man.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
after three adjoining rooms if you have them," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course, sir, I will check." Getting out the most enormous ledger
Harry had ever seen the desk clerk began to flick through the pages
noisily. Harry started peering at his surroundings, noticing the
strange plants in pots by the windows, the gold fixtures and the
myriad collection of lamps and candles that adorned the walls. There
were a few portraits but the wall decorations largely consisted of
landscapes where the leaves on the trees moved slowly in an invisible
breeze and birds intermittently flew noisily across the canvas skies.
Hs attention was diverted by a group of witches entering the door who
were giggling in the most unbearable fashion. He caught some of their
conversation as they drifted past him to the staircase in the corner
of the foyer.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
don't be silly, Ashley," giggled a tall brunette. "I know
you're a bit excited to visit the Big Smoke but you won't be
seeing celebrities on every bleeding street corner!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
telling you, I saw him, it was definitely him!" shrilled a short
blonde with curls. "They said he was coming so of course he'd be
here. Journos never get it wrong!" Harry wondered idly who Ashley
thought she had seen as Bill accepted several room keys from the
clerk behind the desk.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
enjoy your stay at The Orridge Inn," droned the clerk with a forced
smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
it's real original around here," Ron said, snorting. Hermione
hushed him hurriedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you," she said pleasantly to the desk clerk. "Can you give me
some information about the methods of transport in Australia? We'd
like to go to -" she consulted her notes, "country Victoria."</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll
be wanting the bus then?" the clerk asked. Ron shook his head
vehemently and Hermione elbowed him firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"A
bus sounds fine, if that is the normal way to get places," she
sounded dubious. "It does seem an awful long way on the map
though." The clerk stared at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
a witch or what?" The clerk shook his head. "I'll gather
together some brochures that they might find useful and send them up.</p><p class="calibre8">Bill
led the way up to their adjoining rooms and Harry noted with some
trepidation that they seemed to be situated near the group of witches
he'd spotted earlier. They were giggling loudly, the door left wide
open, in the room opposite the one Bill handed him a key to.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
we go and get something to eat?" asked Ron as Hermione tried her
key in the door on the other side.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly
Ron, we just had breakfast!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
but now it's dinner time … and well, I missed lunch!" Hermione
rolled her eyes at him and pushed the door open, disappearing inside.
George and Harry grinned at Ginny behind Ron's back and pushed Ron
into their room, following him inside. As he began to close the door
behind them Harry thought he heard one of the giggly witches squeal
unbearably loudly. Harry hurriedly pushed the door shut to block out
the horrible noise and looked around at the room.</p><p class="calibre8">The
splendor in the foyer of the hotel did absolutely nothing mask the
fact the rooms were, quite simply, not splendid. It didn't bother
Harry however, drab brown walls and uninspiring pictures were not
something that bothered him and they weren't here to spend all
their time in a hotel room anyway. Ron began to investigate the tiny
ensuite, poking through the drawers and cupboards. There was a door
in the wall to his left and Harry opened it to find Hermione and
Ginny whispering in the middle of the next room. George peered over
his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
tell Mum that Bill and Fleur weren't in the middle room," he said
and winked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
yes George, because there is so much danger of anything untoward
going on with you and Ron here!" George just laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not you and Ginny I'm worried about it's Ron and Hermione!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"
Harry raised his eyebrow at George who nodded vigorously.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
heard the way he talks about her," he said emphatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
to you," mused Harry. "He's never said anything much to me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
he probably thinks you'd hex him if he voiced, to you, half of what
he'd like to do to her!" chortled George, "cause he would do
the same to you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
… don't … George," he shuddered. "I probably know what he's
thinking of doing and I don't want to hear it!" Hermione had
marched forcefully over to the door and was standing there, hands on
hips glaring at them both. Harry hurriedly pushed the door closed and
called out to her through the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'll
meet you downstairs!" He strode back across the room and grabbed at
Ron's arm, pulling him out of the door and down the hallway to the
stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think those girls in the room opposite ours are barking, Harry,"
said Ron as he followed Harry down the stairs. "I think they've
been to the zoo or something." He didn't say anything else and
Harry just muttered absently that he'd once been to a zoo.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
I really think they are barking mad," insisted Ron. "Maybe we
should see if we can move to a different room away from them."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why,
Ron? They seemed a bit giggly, but visiting zoos is hardly a crime!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
one of them was saying she was in love with an otter!" Ron
grimaced. "I think she said she wanted to <em class="calibre9">marry
</em>one!" Harry made an indistinct noise
in his throat, choking down a laugh as they reached the foyer.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'd
say it's more likely they were giggling about some <em class="calibre9">bloke</em>
they want to marry, Ron," George said. "Girls giggle like mad
about getting married." Harry nodded emphatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
they were giggling when they got here, about someone famous," he
offered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
well, maybe that's who they were talking about then," said Ron
thoughtfully. "Maybe his name's Otter?" Harry went pale.</p><p class="calibre8">"Say
that again," he demanded. Ron looked at him strangely and frowned.
Hermione and Ginny were approaching from the staircase and as Harry
watched them he thought he could hear the group of giggling witches</p><p class="calibre8">"What?
Someone famous named Otter?" The three of them looked at each other
in horror.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
breathed Harry. As he looked again at the staircase he saw Ashley
poke her head out from around the corner at the top of the staircase.
She squealed and pulled back again.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
is this possible?" he hissed at Ron and George as Hermione and
Ginny caught up to them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill
and Fleur are staying in," announced Ginny with a grimace. Harry
laughed at the look on her face, forgetting about the witches in the
room opposite theirs. He reached out and pulled her into a hug before
whispering in her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
bet you wouldn't be making that face if we were the ones staying
in?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe
my mother should have warned me about <em class="calibre9">you</em>
Harry Potter," murmured Ginny as Harry's lips began playing with
her ear. They both ignored the argument that Ron and Hermione had
started over where to eat and pretended not to see George
deliberately turn his back on their display as Ginny began threading
her fingers through Harry's hair, bringing his head closer to her
own. Harry moved his attention to her lips and lost himself in her
feather light touch as she danced her fingers through his hair. He
thought he heard George murmur that maybe he should be less worried
about the quarrelling duo and more about the amorous twosome but they
didn't actually break apart until he felt a whack on the back of
his head.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
turned, scowling, to find George wielding a newspaper, <em class="calibre9">The
Daily Oracle</em>. Harry just stared at
George as if he had lost his mind because as far as Harry was
concerned – he had. George simply unfurled the paper. Harry took
one look at it and blanched.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">POTTER NUPTIALS PLANNED</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Reports
have it, on good authority, that Harry Potter, wizarding Britain's
most eligible bachelor, is no longer eligible!</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">It
seems that he and his long time girlfriend, a Miss Hermione Granger,
have planned to marry right here. His arrival is anticipated sometime
today. Actual details of the event have been kept securely under
wraps, even from this intrepid reporter.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Speculation
is rife that the hasty nuptials have been planned due to the ill
timed arrival of a bundle of joy during the war that tore apart
wizarding Britain over the last two years. Potter has been seen
several times in the company of a small dark haired baby that can
only have been his child. It seems he is finally about to do right by
the poor tyke's mother.</em></p><p class="calibre8">The
article was accompanied by the picture of him and Hermione in the
Leaky Cauldron and a smaller, fuzzy inset picture of him and Teddy
that had obviously been taken one day at Andromeda's. Harry scowled
fiercely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Blimey,
Harry," said Ron, "I thought dad and Kingsley cleared that mess
up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Obviously
not," ground out Hermione. "This report is worse than the last
one!"</p><p class="calibre8">"And
what do they care all the way over here anyway?" grumbled Harry as
he screwed the paper up and lobbed it at a nearby bin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Tabloid
news, it's got global appeal," muttered Ginny. Harry gave her a
warm smile and slung and arm around her shoulders, pulling her close.
He looked up at Ron and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
go have some fun," he grinned at Hermione. "What are they going
to do when they see both of us at the same time with someone else?
The stories can't get any worse!" Hermione laughed and slipped an
arm around Ron's waist. George eyed them distastefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
need to find myself a chick," he muttered as he trailed after them.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you keep using that term I'll hex you, George," complained
Hermione, twirling her wand. "The correct term in Australia is
sheila." The five of them spilled out laughing into the street and
headed to the alleyway next to the hotel.</p><p class="calibre8">A
large sign bolted to the wall at the entrance of the alleyway
indicated that it was called Tucker Run. The vendors that lined the
streets sported large colourful signs and placards that proclaimed
them as 'the best place to get seafood' or 'award winning'.
Harry strolled down the narrow alley way, his hand in Ginny's
marveling at the sights and sounds that enveloped them. Ron pulled
Hermione ruthlessly from vendor to vendor, from one restaurant to the
next. The tiny street held a vast array of delicacies from all over
the world. There were meats spinning on spits, sizzling stir fries
and seafood buffets. Delicate pastries and exotic ice creams spilled
from dessert lounges and drink vendors pedaled juices, soft drinks
and aromatic coffees.</p><p class="calibre8">Eventually
they settled on a table in the back corner of a restaurant that
boasted 'Modern Australian Cuisine', figuring that if they were
here they might as well experience the local fare. The menu was a
colourful selection of meats, flavoured with bush herbs and spices,
kangaroo steaks and Barramundi, which Hermione assured a dubious Ron
was fish.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
eat kangaroos here?" asked George as if he couldn't quite believe
it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure
do!" came a lively voice from Harry's elbow. "Only place in the
world they eat their own national emblem, so they say. Not that I've
ever been able to work out who 'they' are in any case.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
where are you lot from then? Don't get too many travellers in
August. Mind you I've noticed it's been a bit busier lately.
Perhaps it's that British war being over. Never seen so many Poms
around for years. It's like they're all tryin' to flee the
country. You woulda thought they woulda tried to flee before now!"
Harry raised his eyebrows at Ron as the blonde waiter gave them his
version of what he called 'The Pommy Situation'.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well-"
began Hermione but the waiter ignored her and simply kept talking.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Muggles like to get involved globally. Used to be a time when they'd
send soldiers to fight for British Muggles." The waiter never
seemed to take a breath. "Can't say as wizards ever do that
though. Certainly wasn't no campaign or anything over 'ere for
Aurors to go over or nothing. Some reckon the British Ministry got
taken over by that evil bloke so they weren't about to ask for
anyone else to fight them were they? But who knows what's real that
comes from those British news sources." The way he said 'British
news sources' suggested he considered them a bigger evil than
Voldemort. It seemed he hadn't finished.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course bit more allied to America these days," the waiter said
'America' as if it was worse than British news sources. "The
people are alright o'course but they've got some weird Muggles
running that joint, I'm telling you. Think the US Ministry is
better run though. Anyway, where are you lot from?" Hermione
glanced at Harry and Ron before speaking up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Britain,
actually," she said. Hermione was about to continue, when the
waiter took another deep breath and went on.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
so you've been there then? Fair dinkum? Course you have, you live
there! Don't 'spose you were involved in that war at all? Nah,
kids like yourselves woulda been a bit young to get involved –
although they reckon the whole thing came to a head at a school or
summat?" he looked at them expectantly but did not give them a
chance to confirm or deny what he obviously thought were rumours as
he plunged on. "Of course that Potter bloke's not very old,
schoolboy they reckon, so I suppose it could be true. 'Snot ridgey
didge if you ask me, can't trust that British press. I mean I ask
you, as if he'd come 'ere to get married. Seen that story 'ave
youse? If he's still at school he's not likely to be getting
married at all! What a load of rubbish. Course you look a bit like
the sheila they reckon he's marrying, could get you in a bit of
strife." He waved a finger in Hermione's general direction as he
finished. Hermione smiled and Harry looked at her with a raised
eyebrow while Ginny tried valiantly to stifle a giggle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Anyway
I've gas bagged enough at you lot. I'm supposed to be telling you
I'm ya waiter for this evening and my name's Johnno," he
paused, which had been a rare occurrence during his monologue, before
he sighed. "It's not really Johnno, it's just Jonathon but the
owner thinks the punters want some sort of Aussie flavor and he
thinks that is it. I mean really if he wants Aussie flavor he should
just stick to smothering the kangaroo steaks in bush spices and
serving Liliypily Icecream."</p><p class="calibre8">"And
that's what Australians eat?" asked Ginny dubiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah,"
Jonathon replied, "most of 'em eat the same as the rest of the
world. The Muggles eat a lot of stir fries and pasta but wizarding
folk seem to have got stuck in some sort of British time warp and
it's all dumplings and mutton. Muggleborns like me are changing
that of course but I don't think we'll ever give up the lamb
roast. Stuff like emu is mostly in restaurants. You can get kangaroo
in a supermarket but few people actually buy and cook it. Anyway,
what'll youse have?" They ordered some of the more exotic things
on the menu at Jonathon's suggestion. He said that even though it
wasn't your normal fare it was actually quite good, for a change of
pace.</p><p class="calibre8">The
restaurant was filling up slowly but no one paid any mind to the
small group in the back corner. About halfway through their entrée
Bill's Patronus turned up and asked them where they were. Hermione
sent back a message and Jonathon expanded their table and conjured up
two more chairs. Bill and Fleur arrived moments later while Jonathon
was fetching some extra menus in preparation for their arrival.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
shuffled his chair around to fit the two newcomers at the table and
when Jonathon came back he greeted Bill and Fleur, handing them the
menus before asking the rest of them if they wanted anything else at
the moment. It was the first time he'd seen more than Harry's
profile and Jonathon stopped dead in the middle of a long winded
sentence that extolled the virtues of Australian Muggle Beer over the
imported British mead. He leaned in close to the table, eyeing Harry
with his blue eyes and dropped his voice to a whisper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Here,
<em class="calibre9">you</em> look
like that Potter bloke," he swung towards Hermione and his jaw
dropped. His eyes narrowed. "Well you coulda let a bloke know
before letting me carry on like that before!" Jonathon looked
behind him swiftly and he took his wand out of his pocket and cast a
series of complicated charms around their table.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
was that for?" asked Bill curiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Privacy
charms," Jonathon replied. He waved vaguely to a table near the
front of the restaurant. "There's a bunch of witches over there
and they are giggling about Potter something fierce. You're him,
aren't you?" Harry nodded mutely. Harry and Ginny craned their
necks to see the table in question. It was Ashley and her friends
from the hotel.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
you don't need to be bothered by the likes of them," said
Jonathon authoritatively. "They've been going on about following
you around. I reckon maybe they're stalking you. They can't see
you now though. Somehow, they got a strange compunction to go looking
elsewhere. When you've finished I'll take you through the back."
He paused thoughtfully. "It might cost you an autograph though –
Naomi out the back's a bit of a fan, don't know if I can get
youse past her."</p><p class="calibre8">"You'll
have to start signing them eventually," mumbled Ron, his mouth full
of food. "Are you going to eat that Hermione?" Jonathon watched
shrewdly as Hermione passed him her plate, shaking her head, a smile
on her lips and Ron responded by running his hand up her arm and
leaning in to kiss her cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
that!" said George. "Honestly, you two are sickening. We are at
the dinner table!"</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
er … ya definitely not marrying her then, hey?" said Jonathon to
Harry. He assumed a supremely smug look. "Knew it." Harry shook
his head, a smile playing on his lips and Jonathon took Bill and
Fleur's orders and scurried off to attend to his duties.</p><p class="calibre8">Jonathon
would come back at irregular intervals during the evening to
recommend a dish or particular drink. Occasionally he'd give them a
report on the giggling witches.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
this waitress," he paused and pointed her out during one of his
visits, "Susan, and they have managed to convince her that they
know you! She's running around like a chook with it's head cut
off catering to their every whim. I don't know what she thinks
she's going to get out of it. I'm not at all sure she isn't a
sandwich short of a picnic if she believes that giggly lot. Honestly,
sheilas!" Jonathon glanced hastily at Hermione who growled at him.
"You should definitely try the wattleseed dip with fresh fruit."
He finished hastily before scuttling back to the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">True
to his word Jonathon escorted them through the kitchen and out the
back door of the restaurant. Harry stopped to sign a napkin for an
awestruck Naomi, who happened to be the kitchen hand and as they
spilled out the back door into a dingy alleyway he thought he could
hear Susan's shrill voice exclaiming over the napkin and cursing
the giggly witches at the table near the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
youse all have a good time while ya here," said Jonathon as Bill
conjured several umbrellas to shelter them from the rain that had
begun to fall once again. "It was nice meeting youse."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought it'd be a bit more, you know, dry," said Ron grumpily,
"land of sunshine and that. If I wanted rain I can get that back
home." He moodily splashed the toe of one of his shoes in a puddle.
Jonathon looked at him thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you want dry you should go outback or up country," he said. "It's
dry as a bone there. This rain, here, not much good in the long run.
If it don't fall where it can get into the river system and on the
farming lands it's just not much good at all. We'll take as much
rain as we can get right now. Haven't had a lot for two years now."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
we are going to the country," piped up Hermione excitedly. "When
I can figure out how to get there. The hotel clerk really wasn't
all that helpful with transport arrangements."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
you'll want Ernie's bus," said Jonathon as if it was accepted
fact. Harry swallowed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
have a bus driven by Ernie?" he asked, monotone. Ron paled.
Jonathon nodded eagerly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
Ernie's me best mate! I help him on the bus sometimes but me job
keeps me pretty busy so usually it's Bert," Jonathon was once
again warming to his topic. As they stood there in the street, the
water splashing on their legs and dripping into the top of their
shoes Jonathan launched into another monologue. "Course it's not
really Ernie's bus. I mean he don't own it or nothing, he just
drives it. Loves that job he does, been doing it since we left
school. Ernie took a holiday in New Zealand once and rode the bus
there. He'd never ridden it back here seeing as the train lines run
to school. Don't s'pose you lot catch a train to school do you?</p><p class="calibre8">"Anyway,
prefers brooms normally, does Ernie, Bert too for that matter but
they took this trip in New Zealand on their bus, crazy bloke what
drives that one, and when he got home and finished his EMUS all he
wanted to do was drive the silly bus!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Emus?"
asked Hermione faintly. Jonathon nodded firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ernie
Bingle, sport mad sod! I mean he could be so much more but instead of
sitting normal exams he sits for the Exceptional Magical Umpire
Scores and then starts driving the bleeding Roobus!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Roobus?"
questioned Ron as he quirked an eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
said Jonathon enthusiastically, "we named it, me and Bert and
Ernie! It used to be called the Blackhound, but what sort of a stupid
name is that for a bus? So we renamed it the Roobus. Much more
sensible."</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
quite," said Bill, clearly not understanding why it was in fact
much more sensible. Perhaps Jonathon sensed this because he sighed
exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stands
to reason dunnit?" he looked from one to the other and they stared
back at him blankly. "Crikey poms are daft. You got a bus that hops
from one place to another, what else would you call it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
sure," said Ron a little weakly as he raised an eyebrow at Harry
who shrugged. As far as Harry was concerned Jonathon was alright –
if a little enthusiastic. Jonathon had treated Harry courteously and
without the awe that attended some of the other people he'd met
recently. His prompt shielding of Harry from the giggly witches had
earned Jonathon, although he did not know it, a new friend.</p><p class="calibre8">It
was getting late when Harry found himself walking back to the hotel
on a nearly deserted street, sharing an umbrella with Ginny and
listening to Hermione as she explained what she had organised with
Jonathon regarding the Roobus. He really did try to listen carefully
to Hermione's long winded explanation about Apparating buses and
how it would only take moments to go the six hundred kilometres from
Sydney to Yackandandah, something that took the Muggles six hours. Of
course Ernie might have a few stops along the way but wouldn't that
be a wonderful way to see the country. The Roobus didn't operate on
weekends but there was so much to see in Muggle Sydney and Jonathon
was happy to take them on a tour in the morning. Of course they might
not be able to sleep at the right time so who knew what sort of havoc
that would create with their body clocks.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
wondered briefly if Hermione had always talked in this fashion or if
it was something she'd picked up from Jonathon himself. He soon
paid it no heed because he could feel Ginny's hand, which had been
resting on his hip, slide down to rest in the back pocket of his
jeans and it made him acutely aware of her hip bumping into his and
her hair swishing back and forth over the arm that he had slung
around her shoulder. She leaned her head against him as they walked
and Harry found himself slowing down until they were behind the rest
of them, Hermione gesturing all the while. Taking his chance Harry
stopped and bent his head down to kiss Ginny. With the umbrella as a
shield he didn't hesitate to deepen the kiss immediately. Ginny
responded promptly and he was soon lost in her, standing in the
middle of the footpath.</p><p class="calibre8">Dimly
he heard Bill call out to them that they could find their own way
back to the hotel but if they weren't back in an hour he'd hunt
them down. Harry took that as permission to continue and they made
full use of their allotted hour.</p>
