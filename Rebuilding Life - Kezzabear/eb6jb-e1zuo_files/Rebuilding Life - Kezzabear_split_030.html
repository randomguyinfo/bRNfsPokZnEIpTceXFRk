			<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">A/N: I'm not
used to adding these, but I wanted to thank everyone for their
reviews and so forth. Someone said I *had* to tell people why the fic
was rated M if I was going to rate it that. I didn't realise I
*had* to do anything. But since it was demanded of me – I rated it
M to be on the safe side because I suck at getting ratings right and
everyone has a different opinion and that's the box I ticked
*shrugs*. There's no swearing, there's no explicit sex and only
some bloodshed but I was once told to up a rating when Harry and
Ginny kissed so now I err on the side of caution.</strong></p><p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">Anyway, glad you
are all enjoying the story!</strong></p><p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p><p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">30.
Safety</strong></p><p class="calibre8">The rest of that
first half-week at school passed quietly. Ron had returned home after
kissing Hermione passionately in the middle of the common room and
making her blush. He'd also slipped Harry a bar of Honeydukes
chocolate and told him it might come in handy as a peace offering,
given the look Ginny was throwing him. Ginny hadn't spoken more
than three words to Harry for the rest of the night and went to bed
early without giving him a good night kiss. Hermione took pity on him
and told him why Ginny was upset, instead of making him work or beg
for it. The first opportunity he got the next morning, Harry pulled
Ginny aside to apologise.</p><p class="calibre8">They had just
finished breakfast and were on the way to Herbology when Harry ducked
into a secret passage along the way, dragging Ginny with him. She
looked at him coldly and Harry solemnly handed her the bar of
chocolate.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
he said. Ginny took it hesitantly and began opening it. She paused
before breaking a piece off and popping it in her mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"What for?" she
mumbled. Harry had a feeling he was being set up. After a long pause
he sighed. It was no use; he couldn't possibly anticipate what the
correct answer was. He made a silent vow to himself to actually read
<em class="calibre9">Twelve Failsafe Ways</em> because Ron clearly knew more than he
did. Harry decided to go with what should be a safe answer.</p><p class="calibre8">"Being stupid,"
he said. Ginny snorted and broke off another piece of chocolate. She
stuffed it in her mouth and looked Harry in the eye.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry squirmed.</p><p class="calibre8">"If I'm not
allowed to run off, then neither are you," she said finally. "You
aren't the only one who's earned the right to worry. I waited a
long time to be able to worry with you." She looked away quickly
and shredded the wrapper on the chocolate bar. but not quick enough
to mask the hurt in her eyes. Harry reached out to caress her cheek
before trailing his hand down her neck and arm to grasp her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know. I'm
sorry," he said. He was utterly sincere. "I just … it had been
a long day and he sort of took me by surprise."</p><p class="calibre8">"Gerald?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," said
Harry. "He was in hiding with Dudley." Ginny's eyes went wide
and her mouth formed a perfect 'O' of surprise. She squeezed his
hand and then broke off another piece of chocolate and popped it in
her mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
going to do about it?" she asked. Harry watched as the chocolate
rolled around her tongue and mouth as she spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're going to
find their dad,' he said absently as he moved closer to her. '"Are
you going to share any of that?" Ginny grinned at him and slowly
broke the remainder into two pieces. Harry reached out and placed his
hands on her waist pulling her close.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe," said
Ginny, "if you're good."</p><p class="calibre8">"What do I have to
do to be good?" Harry asked as he lowered his mouth to her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's a decent
start," Ginny breathed as she ate one of the pieces and tilted her
head to give Harry better access to the lovely soft patch of skin
just behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's mine?"
Harry murmured, hovering over her lips. Ginny held up the last piece
of chocolate, tantalisingly close to his lips before smiling
wickedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come and get it,"
she whispered putting it on the tip of her tongue. Harry needed no
second invitation and he pressed his mouth over hers, sweeping the
chocolate into his own mouth as he kissed her fiercely.</p><p class="calibre8">The temptation to
stay there had been immense. The kiss was warm and chocolatey and
Ginny seemed to enjoy trying to get the chocolate back. Every kiss
should taste of chocolate, Harry thought. But then the chocolate was
gone and Harry knew that every kiss should taste like Ginny. They did
make it to Herbology just in time but Hermione eyed them
disapprovingly, Dean and Seamus were unable to keep a straight face
and Neville kept signalling something. Eventually Ginny reached over
and straightened his tie before wiping a smear of chocolate from the
knot. Professor Sprout had been far too involved in explaining the
intricacies of Rueberries and Flagwort to pay any attention to them
and Harry grinned as Ginny trailed a finger down his tie – to make
sure it was perfectly straight, of course.</p><p class="calibre8">That morning also
saw their introduction to the new Transfiguration professor.
Professor Thistlewaite continually dropped things whenever Harry
caught his eye. Harry and Ginny began counting how many times Harry
could make him drop his quill or a book. It didn't last long
because every time the professor bent over to retrieve the dropped
item, his hat would fall off and he would perch it hastily on his
head only to have it start to slide off again. Nothing was getting
done and Hermione was giving both Harry and Ginny a look designed to
freeze hell over. Harry stopped trying to terrorise the poor man who
was clearly in awe of him and they spent the lesson mostly listening
to stories about the professor's Aunt Flossie who was gifted in
Transfiguration. Seamus decided by the end of that first lesson that
she needed to be canonised, given how often Professor Thistlewaite
referenced her as 'sainted'.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm going to
submit it to the Muggle Pope," he declared. "I mean I'd submit
me old Auntie Bridget but she's not sainted, merely giddy."</p><p class="calibre8">Double Charms nearly
had the older Gryffindors in tears of laughter when Seamus managed to
set fire to six pillows trying to clean and shrink them
simultaneously.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, no, no Mr
Finnegan," squeaked Professor Flitwick. "Do the charms one at a
time! It's supposed to be a revision to ease you all back into the
school year, not a time to practice <em class="calibre9">Augamenti</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop," said
Hermione, a wicked gleam in her eye as Seamus waved his wand wildly
trying to extinguish the cushions. "You're saying it wrong."
She extinguished the cushions and restored them efficiently. Seamus
pretended to swoon at her feet and Dean muttered something about her
being completely mental. The reprimand she got for turning his hair
into dreadlocks was minor.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, no, no Miss
Granger," said tiny Professor Flitwick. "This is Charms, not
Transfiguration." Later that night at dinner she confessed that
Flitwick had asked her later that afternoon if she needed extra help
due to her year away. He had been worried she was struggling to
settle back into school.</p><p class="calibre8">As Harry flew around
the Quidditch pitch on Friday just before lunch he wondered if he was
struggling to settle back into school. He'd had Thursday afternoon
free and now most of Friday – after a particularly excruciating
Double Potions class where he and Malfoy had been unfailingly polite
to each other. In fact, Harry had a free timetable until the fourth
class on Monday, which was after the morning break. Ginny and
Hermione were currently in Arithmancy and that afternoon Hermione had
an Ancient Runes class. Harry felt at a bit of a loose end. He knew
he should be using the time wisely to study but he had never had a
free period without Ron before. Neville was taking extra Herbology
classes; Seamus and Dean were taking Care of Magical Creatures and
spending their spare time playing Exploding Snap and plotting to win
Audrey over.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt alone.</p><p class="calibre8">He finished flying
and made his way up to Gryffindor Tower. Stowing his Firebolt in his
dorm room, he pondered his Muggle Studies text briefly but simply
couldn't bring himself to take the set essay seriously. Professor
Crockwell had assigned two feet of parchment on the board game
Monopoly. He'd never played it but he'd seen Dudley and Uncle
Vernon play it all the time. It never ended well as the two were as
greedy as each other. Harry sighed heavily as he shoved the text book
to the side and flopped onto his bed. He'd been avoiding the
Chumleys and avoiding contacting Dudley. It was as if Liberty knew he
was supposed to be sending a letter because she kept flying to the
dormitory window and looking at him balefully.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt guilty
for not writing and for not paying attention to his owl. Liberty was
sitting on the windowsill and Harry deliberately turned his back on
her. The only incentive to sending Dudley an Owl was that it would
drive his aunt and uncle mad. The thought made him chuckle briefly
before he spied his potions text book under the Muggle Studies text
and scowled. In order to complete the assignment Slughorn had set he
would have to actually see, speak to and interact with Malfoy more
than once outside the Potions class. Although it had been amusing to
hear Malfoy practically admit to being a complete and utter git, it
did not mean Harry wanted to spend any extra time with him.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry found himself
wandering slowly down the Grand Staircase to lunch, at least half an
hour before the meal was scheduled to start. He was halfway down the
staircase and was pondering getting off on the fourth floor landing
to take a stroll along a gallery he'd found once, tucked away into
an obscure wing of the castle and full of oddly shaped urns, when the
staircase suddenly changed and swung to deposit him on the fifth
floor from which he'd just come.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a good
thing I'm not in a hurry," he muttered peevishly as he stomped
along the landing, trying to navigate onto a set of stairs that would
actually go down instead of up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Perhaps you
should be," piped up a small voice from his left. Harry didn't
even blink.</p><p class="calibre8">"What would you
know?" he asked, without bothering to check which painting had
spoken.</p><p class="calibre8">"Putting things
off never led to anything good!" proclaimed the tiny voice. "If
you don't do it now you might never get a chance!" Harry turned
to locate the sage advice giver. In a tiny painting, no bigger than a
dinner plate was a fat, dimpled little boy in an old fashioned frock
coat. He held a large piece of cake in one hand and a lollypop in the
other. He looked familiar.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gee," said
Harry sarcastically. "You sure look like you know all about that."</p><p class="calibre8">"I may look
stupid," said the boy in the painting, "but I'm not."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're right,"
said Harry. "You do look stupid." He turned to go when the
painted boy laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You'd think
you, of all people, would have learnt <em class="calibre9">carpe diem</em>," he
scoffed before shoving the lollypop in his mouth and shuffling out of
his painting and into the meadow in the painting next door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey, what does
that mean?" demanded Harry, but the fat little painted boy ignored
him and concentrated on aiming a kick at the cow in the meadow and
then running away laughing when the occupant of that painting, a
thin, mean looking woman shouted and began chasing him with a frying
pan. It was then Harry realised the boy reminded him of Dudley. Harry
shook his head and kept going down to the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">He was distracted
while trying to decipher the little boy's words and fell victim to
one of the trick staircases. He was still there, his leg stuck in it
up to his knee when Professor McGonagall swept around a nearby
corner. She raised an eyebrow at Harry who was perched at a rather
precarious angle, one foot stretched behind him and the knee on his
other leg starting to glow an odd sickly shade of green where several
misfired spells had failed to release it. Harry was scowling at his
wand and trying to aim it correctly. Professor McGonagall made a
tutting sound.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought you
knew where all the trick staircases were, Potter?" she queried,
getting out her wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"I did, I do,"
said Harry through gritted teeth. "I wasn't think- erm, they've
moved this one." Professor McGonagall unsuccessfully hid her smile
as she waved her wand and muttered an incantation that released
Harry's leg.</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you find
your timetable?' Professor McGonagall asked him as she walked
alongside him as he continued down to the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's fine,"
sighed Harry. "All my free time seems to be together though and,
erm… I am at a bit of a loose end. I'm not used to having um,
time."</p><p class="calibre8">"Large blocks of
time without prior commitment can be very … useful," McGonagall
said. She sounded as though she was choosing her words very
carefully. "They allow one to, shall we say, take care of other
responsibilities and commitments." She gave Harry a meaningful
look.</p><p class="calibre8">"You mean like …
Teddy?" Harry asked, unsure if he had grasped her meaning.
Professor McGonagall nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think you will
find Hagrid perfectly able to facilitate …" she lowered her voice
as they went past a group of students so small they had to be first
years, "exit and entry. Don't be late for lunch, Potter." The
Professor hastened her step as they neared the door to the Great Hall
and swept inside. Harry stared after her with a grin. If he wasn't
mistaken, she had just told him to go and visit Teddy in his free
time.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny's eyes
sparkled as Harry told her what Professor McGonagall had told him
regarding the use of his free time. He had decided to go and visit
Teddy that night and come back the next day.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just imagine how
we can use this," Ginny said with a wide smile. Hermione broke in
disapprovingly before she could say anything else.</p><p class="calibre8">"I doubt Professor
McGonagall meant you, Ginny," she said with a frown. "You have
Astronomy early on Monday and we need to prepare tonight. The
wireless said it would be cloudy over the weekend and you know we
need to bring that filled-in chart to class." Ginny made a face as
Hermione turned back to her text book and absently bit into a
sandwich.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's right,"
she sighed. "I have a pile of Arithmancy homework to do as well as
that silly Monopile essay."</p><p class="calibre8">"I tell you what,"
said Harry. "I'll go get a Monopoly set and we can play it on
Sunday and write our essays."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hmmm, this could
be to my advantage," said Ginny slyly. "I have run out of
chocolate and I'll need some next week." Harry furrowed his
eyebrows at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"How can you
possibly know you'll <em class="calibre9">need</em> chocolate next week?" he asked
her, puzzled. Ginny blushed slightly."Are we expecting a Dementor
attack?" He raised his eyebrow at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"For the same
reason Ron sent me some yesterday, Harry," said Hermione primly as
she packed her bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron sent you
chocolate?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Harry."</p><p class="calibre8">"For some specific
reason?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Harry,"
repeated Hermione before she left. Harry looked around in confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"But why?" he
asked no one in particular.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just buy her the
chocolate, Harry," said Dean as he got up. "It'll be worth it."
Ginny threw a balled up napkin at his head and he laughed before
accompanying Seamus to the Ravenclaw table where Audrey turned her
back on the pair of them for what was probably the twentieth time –
that day.</p><p class="calibre8">"What sort of
chocolate, Ginny?" he asked. She shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Doesn't
matter," she said before grimacing. "I need to go meet Susan.
She's going to help me with some Arithmancy. It's such a bore. I
probably won't even need this for Quidditch, but Mum ..." She
trailed off with a grimace and shrugged as she stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
tomorrow," said Harry catching her hand before she left. Ginny
turned and gave him a soft smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can't wait,"
she said and pressed a kiss to his cheek before shouldering her bag.
"I like soft centres." Harry laughed and watched her as she left,
turning at the door to wave.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have fun, Harry,"
said Neville as he grabbed a sandwich and gathered his own bag. "I
… well I have to help Professor Sprout with some re-potting this
evening but maybe I can visit Teddy with you one time?" He seemed a
little shy as he said it and ducked his head as if he thought Harry
might laugh at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"That'd be
great, Neville," said Harry sincerely. Neville beamed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
later, Harry," he said. "Don't forget that chocolate."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" wondered
Harry aloud to his retreating back. "What's so important about
chocolate?" Neville chuckled and said nothing. Harry scowled but
his bad mood did not last long and within half an hour he had
gathered together his things and was on his way to Hagrid's Hut.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry found Hagrid
tending his garden. Harry watched for a moment as he saw Fang
gambolling around the pumpkin patch where the tiniest of pumpkins
were growing on sprawling vines. Hagrid was trying to pull out a
massive weed and it was resisting vehemently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah come out yer
crazy green piece o' compost!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Need some help?"
called Harry. Hagrid looked up.</p><p class="calibre8">" 'Arry!" he
called. "Professor McGonagall said you might be comin' ter see me
this afternoon." Harry nodded as he put his bag down.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I'll be
right with yer as soon as I get this thing outta the ground," he
grunted. "Right useful plant an' all but not among me pumpkins."</p><p class="calibre8">"Er, what is it?"
Harry eyed the plant suspiciously. It was about a foot tall and had
several stalk like vines and large glossy leaves sprouted directly
from the stalks. There was a single large flower with white petals
and a massive yellow centre sitting at the bottom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gabblerwort,"
replied Hagrid shortly before giving another heave. The flower
suddenly snapped shut and the plant let out a scream. Harry slapped
his hands over his ears.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why can't you
just leave it there?" he asked when the scream had stopped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well it's
already strangled three of me pumpkins!" exclaimed Hagrid. "I
can't just leave it there! Can't have the Halloween Feast without
pumpkins now, can we?" Harry sighed resignedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, of course
not," he murmured.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't seem to
get it out though," said Hagrid wiping his brow with one large
hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not really
that big," said Harry critically. "I bet its root system is
bigger than the plant, though." Harry peered closely at the thing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe I should
get Professor Sprout down here to get it out if she wants it so
much," grumbled Hagrid.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor Sprout
wants it?" asked Harry as he poked the plant timidly. Hagrid just
nodded, the dirt previously trapped in his beard flying off in
alarmingly large clumps.</p><p class="calibre8">"Apparently it's
one of th' main ingredients in a new werewolf potion Professor
Slughorn is trying to develop. Supposed to be more effective than the
Wolfsbane. 'Parently this is the finest lookin' plant the
professors have ever seen," he said. "Professor Sprout wants to
cultivate it, I think. If they can brew this potion it might stop
this big push on at the Ministry lately. There's some quill-pusher
wantin' to redo all th' werewolf legislation. Some joker called
Brown or summat." Harry's stomach lurched.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do they want
to do to the werewolves?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Put more controls
on 'em. How'd yer like that?" rumbled Hagrid gruffly. "Reckons
they can't be trusted and anyone who's ever had any contact needs
to be locked up at the full moon. Wants to register all 'werewolf
influenced' offspring, set up some sort of home fer 'em. Bill
Weasley's fightin'em tooth an' nail."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt ill.
Hagrid looked at him curiously as he sat down abruptly on a nearby
stump.</p><p class="calibre8">"You all righ',
'Arry?" he asked, getting up and searching a pile of gardening
tools nearby before pulling out a large garden fork. Harry took a
deep breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I'm fine,
Hagrid," he said. "I just – I need to go do something."
Hagrid nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Figured you
migh'," was all he said as he plunged the fork into the earth
near the plant. "Jus' lemme get this plant to the Greenhouses and
-" Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and cast a Summoning Charm
on the plant. With a loud squelch it pulled free of the ground and
came zooming into his arms, showering him with dirt. He handed the
plant gingerly to Hagrid who looked at him in amazement.</p><p class="calibre8">"Got a pot?"
asked Harry shortly. Hagrid chuckled and turned to dump the plant in
a nearby Hessian sack. He scooped a few handfuls of dirt into the
sack and tied the top around the stalk of the plant.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll just take
this up ter the professor an' be righ' back 'Arry." Harry
nodded and sat back on the stump to wait.</p><p class="calibre8">This changed his
plans. He still intended to visit Teddy but he needed to know what
was going on with this legislation. He needed to see Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">**************</p><p class="calibre8">Grateful not to have
to use the Floo, Harry still stumbled on his landing outside
Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. He pushed the door open and immediately a
loud clanging began sounding throughout the shop. Ron suddenly dashed
out of the room, his wand held aloft and his eyes darting furiously.
He relaxed visibly when he saw it was Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm going to
rip his other ear off soon," Ron muttered grumpily as he reached up
and pulled a green wire out of a box above the door. Harry peered
into the box curiously as the clanging noise became a persistent
ringing.</p><p class="calibre8">"What is that
thing?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Some thing called
a door bang," said Ron frowning at the red glow coming from the
wire in his hand. "Dad got it in some raid on a Muggle bookshop. He
reckons it is supposed to let the shopkeeper know a customer is
there. He gave it to George who thought it'd be a good idea to
spell it to make a noise when someone opened our door." Ron
wrestled briefly with a red wire, finally pulling it free and the
lingering ringing stopped abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's a
door bell," said Harry, following Ron to the counter where he
dumped the wires into a bent wire wastepaper basket.</p><p class="calibre8">"That is not a
bell; that is a bang!" complained Ron. The wastepaper basket
belched and spit the wires back out onto Ron's feet. He kicked them
under the counter. "George spelled it all right but it makes that
awful sound every time and I still think it's someone starting a
fight. He went off to the pub laughing about it. I'm the one who
has to put up with the noise!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I guess not
any more," said Harry, dropping his bag next to the counter and
picking up a trick wand from the bin by the door. He waved it
experimentally and it turned into a trout – complete with the
smell.</p><p class="calibre8">"New and
improved," said Ron proudly as Harry wrinkled his nose. "What are
you doing here anyway? How'd you get out of the castle?" Ron
chuckled as Harry explained the tacit permission he had received,
from the Headmistress, to leave the school grounds.</p><p class="calibre8">"But I got delayed
because Hagrid was supposed to unlock the gate for me and he was
fighting some crazy plant in the pumpkin patch," said Harry as he
fiddled with a stand of Wonderwitch products.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wow, you went out
the gate?" smirked Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I know it's
unusual for me," deadpanned Harry, "but apparently I'm going to
be a world-class Auror. At some point I have to start following the
rules."</p><p class="calibre8">"Heh," said Ron,
walking to a door at the rear of the shop. "Moody wasn't what I'd
call a rule keeper." Harry followed his friend and leaned in the
doorway as Ron inspected a bubbling cauldron in the room beyond.</p><p class="calibre8">"His nickname was
also <em class="calibre9">Mad</em>-Eye," retorted Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good point,"
said Ron as he stirred the cauldron twice clockwise. "Dad's
spearheading a campaign to put a new statue in the Ministry; a
memorial for the people like Moody who died … last year."</p><p class="calibre8">"Better than
whatever campaign's going on about werewolves," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah, I heard
about that," said Ron, adding a pinch of something dark and muddy
looking to the cauldron. The thick orange potion bubbled viciously
before subsiding. "Bill's furious."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who is trying to
redo the legislation?" asked Harry as Ron put a cover on the
cauldron. Ron turned and exited the small storeroom that held
experiments in progress and Harry stepped out of the way as Ron shut
the door behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Some uncle of
Lavender's," he answered. "Her family's all bent outta shape
by the fact Greyback went after her."</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought she was
all right?" asked Harry, following Ron around the shop as he
straightened stock on the shelves.</p><p class="calibre8">"She is," Ron
said softly. "She wasn't hurt by that animal anyway. Hermione got
to him before Greyback got to her. Parvati says she's terrified of
her own shadow now, though."</p><p class="calibre8">"Parvati didn't
come back with Padma," mused Harry as he picked up a Skiving
Snackbox.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah she and
Lavender set up that new fortune telling place over there," said
Ron, gesturing out the window to a small door, shrouded in filmy
shawls. "Opened it up … Monday I think it was. I've seen
Parvati out and about, she came over here one day and George tried to
chat her up. Lavender never comes out though. Parvati reckons she
Floos in every morning and she avoids all the customers and just does
the books and things and then Floos home at night. Parvati was saying
she doesn't think Lavender even goes outside."</p><p class="calibre8">"But Lavender was
all right," protested Harry. "She came to the award ceremony and
spoke to Luna for that article and everything." Ron shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Apparently she
went a bit … strange last full moon," he said. "Parvati said
she had some sort of nightmare about werewolves. I'd go and see her
but … somehow I think I'm the last person she'd want to talk
to, y'know? Are you buying that?" Harry looked down, startled at
the package in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," he said.
"I think it'll give Ginny a way out next time Hermione corners
her to study." Ron snorted indelicately and then waved off Harry's
money.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly, as if
we'd let you pay," he said as he pulled the blinds down on the
window near the cash register. "I'm closing up, where are you
headed anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I was gong to see
Teddy, but I need to find out about that werewolf legislation,"
Harry answered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, Bill's
your man there," said Ron absently, counting the day's takings
and putting it into a Gringotts sack. "Why don't you Floo him and
ask him if you can drop by? I've got to run to the bank. You do
that and I'll meet you back here. Then we can head home. I'm
telling you, mum will be that thrilled to have you home to fatten
up." Harry laughed and headed to the office.</p><p class="calibre8">Bill agreed to fill
Harry in on the new proposed legislation immediately and said he'd
meet him at the Burrow after tea that night. Harry had no sooner
pulled his head out of the fireplace when Hannah's frantic voice
filled the room as her head popped up in the green flames.</p><p class="calibre8">'Ron! Are you
there?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah, he's
stepped out. Erm, I can give him a message if you like?" answered
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh! Harry! Oh –
um okay, that'd be great," Hannah seemed surprised to see him,
for which Harry did not blame her. "Just tell him … oh just tell
him can he please come and get his brother." There was a loud crash
and the sound of breaking glass and Hannah pulled her head swiftly
from the flames and was gone.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron shook his head
when Harry gave him the message. His shoulders slumped and he looked
defeated.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's barely
five in the afternoon," he said dejectedly. "I think George is
getting worse. I've never had to pick him up so early before."
Harry squeezed Ron's shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on, I'll
help," he said and the two of them stepped out into the falling
dusk and, locking the door behind them, made their way to The Leaky
Cauldron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hannah's been
pretty good," said Ron as they walked. "She looks after George
you know; calls me when he's had too much at lunch, sometimes late
at night." He shrugged. Harry didn't know what to say. This was
a new part of life, one he'd not seen before, one which he
suspected Ron had grown weary of hiding.</p><p class="calibre8">When they entered
the pub through the back entrance it was a world of noise and colour
– the hair and the language. A red-headed man stood in the middle
of the pub, a large tankard of mead in one hand and gesturing wildly
with the other.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh thank goodness
you're here!" exclaimed Hannah, dashing over to them, a tower of
glasses wobbling precariously in her grasp. "He sort of got really
loud really suddenly and I just didn't realise he'd had so much
to drink!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But-but that's
not George!" sputtered Ron as the red-head sloshed the mead down
his front trying to drink it. "That's <em class="calibre9">Percy</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, he's your
brother, isn't he?" said Hannah impatiently and she walked away,
her tower of glasses swaying dangerously. Ron sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why me?" he
muttered as he approached the now singing Percy. Harry trailed after
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ninety-nine
bottles of mead on the wall, ninety-nine bottles of me-eaaaaaaad!"
bellowed Percy before letting out a loud belch in Ron's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi Percy, you
sound like you've had ninety-nine bottles of mead," Ron said,
taking the tankard from his brother's grasp and putting it on a
nearby table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" Percy
protested. "Thass mine!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, it was,"
said Ron grimly. "But seeing as you've had enough mead we're
giving it to the poor people."</p><p class="calibre8">"Haven't had
enough mead," said Percy woefully. "Still hurss. It still hurss!
Gimme back my drink." Ron shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah mate, come on
let's get you home," he said and then paused." Although come to
think of it, Merlin knows where it is you live."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron?"
questioned Percy suddenly, peering through his spectacles at his
younger brother. "Ron, is tha' you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, it is and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh Ronnie
bo-oooooooooy!" Percy suddenly burst into song. "The pipes the
pipes is ca-aaaaalling … only I think it was Hannah called you …
from glen to glen and down th' mount – hey there ain't no
mountains in Diagon Alley! Ooh mountains … I learnt a song once,
this Muggle girl taught me, about mountains. She reckons there ain't
any high enough. She let me see her -" Percy paused, tried to grab
the mead again and looked around and lowered his voice to what he
probably imagined was a conspiratorial whisper, "her peaks if you
know what I mean?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's lovely,"
said Ron, moving the mead further out of Percy's reach and pulling
out a chair to push his older brother into.</p><p class="calibre8">"She had some very
nice breasts," murmured Percy contemplatively. "I'll tell you
who else has very nice breasts – P'nelpy. Not that I have ever
touched them. S'not right isst?" He looked up at Ron imploringly
and Harry saw a tear roll down his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am sure she has
very nice breasts. Let's get you home," Ron muttered. "Now can
you please tell me where you live?" Percy regarded him solemnly for
a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"I live in a
flat," he enunciated very carefully. "An' it's very, very
boring. Jus' like me." He nodded emphatically before clutching
his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I can
believe that," said Ron, rolling his eyes. "Where is it?" Percy
suddenly looked at Ron with wide eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Guess who else
has gotten breasts, Ron?" he said urgently. "Ginny has gotten
'em. Someone's going to try and touch hers!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't be daft,
man," said Ron, hoisting Percy to his feet and slinging an arm
around his shoulder. "She's going out with Harry." Percy stood
up ramrod straight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sheesh got a
boyfriend? Have I met him? Ish he nice?" Percy's words tumbled
out faster than the Hogwarts Express. "Heesh not going to touch her
… peaks is he?" He slumped forward as if the effort of speaking
had exhausted him.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, of course
he's not," Ron rolled his eyes at Percy behind his back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good," said
Percy decisively, stumbling back and falling into the chair, "cos
thass jus' not right." Ron hauled Percy out of the seat again and
slung one arm over his shoulder. Percy swayed precariously and Harry
hurried to prop up his other side. Percy peered at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on mate,"
muttered Ron and began leading them to the door. "We'll take him
to the Burrow. I don't think this one should Floo, he's liable to
get out at the wrong grate; hope my Side-Along is up to it." Percy
lurched sideways suddenly and Harry staggered under the weight.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey," mumbled
Percy, "you're Harry Potter. You're a hero. You figh'
dragonsh!" Harry grimaced as Percy breathed in his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, yes," said
Ron impatiently as Percy stopped and took his arm from around Ron's
neck and reached up in the vague direction of Harry's forehead.
Harry eyed Percy warily and then winced as Percy narrowly missed his
eye and stabbed him in the temple.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've got a
scar up there," slurred Percy as Ron grabbed his arm and slung it
back around his shoulders. "P'nelpy's got a scar. From slicin'
s-stuff. Potion s-s-stuff. Snape, he c-called 'er … called 'er
…"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dunderhead?"
supplied Ron, grunting with the effort of dragging a resisting Percy
out of the pub so they could concentrate on Apparating him home.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yesh!" shouted
Percy triumphantly. "But sheesh not. Sheesh not a dunderderhead.
Sheesh very, very shmart."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes of course she
is, hold tight Perce." Ron signalled to Harry to let go of Percy
and then Apparated them both away. Harry followed moments later and
reappeared on the lawn outside the Burrow to find Ron holding Percy
up as he vomited into a garden bed. Percy looked wretched. He was
slightly green around the edges and looked extremely wan as he wiped
his mouth with the back of his hand. Ron abruptly hauled Percy to his
feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on, inside,
let's sober you up," he said briskly. He dragged Percy up the
back steps and into the kitchen. Harry trailed after them. He watched
as Ron sat Percy in one of the chairs at the kitchen table and pulled
out his wand. Percy lurched forward and tried to get up. Ron shot out
a hand to pin him in place.</p><p class="calibre8">"I have to get
back," Percy mumbled. "Got to 'pologise … 'splain thins."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no you don't,
sunshine," muttered Ron, emphasising his words by pressing Percy
back into the chair. "Sit tight and in a few minutes you can
<em class="calibre9">'splain</em> things to me." He waved his wand and muttered an
incantation Harry had never heard before and suddenly Percy groaned
and laid his head on the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh why is the
room spinning?" he whimpered quietly, closing his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because you had
too much to drink you git," answered Ron loudly and Percy winced,
clutching his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought you
sobered him?" Harry commented, observing Percy as he moved slowly
and carefully to pick up the jug of water on the table and pour
himself a glass.</p><p class="calibre8">"I did," said
Ron with some satisfaction. "Hangover charm comes separate, after
he tells me what made him drink a lake full of mead."</p><p class="calibre8">"I only had the
two tankards," said Percy, "and I have a vague feeling I didn't
even finish the second one."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well yes, two
tankards of mead on top of how much Firewhiskey?" Ron said as he
leant against the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just three
shots," protested Percy, his head in his hands. Ron shook his head
with a wry grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't go
drinking any more, hey Perce?" he said. "You simply cannot hold
your liquor. Now what is it got you so bent outta shape that Hannah
had to call me to come get you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I wasn't that
bad," said Percy weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes, you
were!" ground out Ron, poking a finger in the air near Percy's
face. "You were so sloshed it took <em class="calibre9">both</em> Harry and me to get
you home!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry? He's at
school," said Percy, taking a sip of his water.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, he's not,"
said Ron. "He's standing right there because he had something
better to do this weekend than look after drunken brothers, so pull
yourself together!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But she's
left," said Percy with a despondent glance at Harry, "and she is
never coming back."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who?" asked Ron
impatiently searching the large containers on one of the sideboards
and pulling out a handful of biscuits and tossing one to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Penelope,"
moaned Percy. "She thinks I was having an affair with Stella!"
Ron stopped short, a biscuit halfway to his mouth which was wide open
in shock. He dropped abruptly into the chair next to Percy.</p><p class="calibre8">"She left you?"
he repeated blankly. "But you … you've been together for six
years."</p><p class="calibre8">"Seven," said
Percy distantly. "Well close enough to anyway, we didn't sort of
really get officially together until sixth year but, well … we
didn't have anyone else for a whole year before that."</p><p class="calibre8">"So … what
happened?" asked Ron, pushing a crumbling biscuit over to his older
brother. Percy picked it up and ate it absently, staring into the
distance.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stella," he
mumbled through biscuit crumbs. "D'you remember that day you
came, Harry?" Harry jumped, startled at being addressed; he nodded
quickly and sank into a seat at the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," he said.
"I thought you were imagining that she was stalking you." Percy
nodded emphatically and groaned. Ron muttered a quick incantation
under his breath and Percy suddenly looked a lot more relaxed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You were right,"
he said. "She's got a Muggle boyfriend with a Heavy Darlinson and
a really big tattoo – bigger than George's."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harley Davidson,"
murmured Harry at the same time Ron yelped, "George has got a
tattoo?" Percy looked at Ron questioningly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," was all
he said. Ron shook his head slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what did
Stella do?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing!" cried
Percy, "but Penelope thinks she did. She saw Stella getting
something out of my eye – I had been inspecting the renovations to
one of the court rooms and I got some dust or something in it – and
then the next thing I know Penelope's screaming about trust and
relationships and … and she called me <em class="calibre9">boring</em>." Percy stuck
a hand in his pocket and pulled out a ring. It sat on the palm of his
hand, glinting in the light from the candle on the mantelpiece. Dusk
was falling rapidly and Harry could smell a delicious meal from the
cauldron on the stove but everything else faded away as he stared at
the ring, the symbol of love that Percy had given Penelope.</p><p class="calibre8">"She gave it
back," Percy said quietly. None of them said anything. Harry felt
an odd sort of sympathy for Percy. He knew what it was like to be
ignored by the girl of your dreams but he knew it would hurt a
million times worse if she rejected you on that level.</p><p class="calibre8">Just then Molly came
bustling in. Percy snapped his hand shut and pocketed the ring before
studiously taking a sip from his glass. Molly had obviously been
upstairs, judging by the overflowing laundry hamper she was carrying,
but Harry hadn't heard her tread on the stairs. She stopped short
when she saw them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy!
Harry! What are you boys doing here?" she exclaimed dropping the
basket. "Is everything all right at Hogwarts, Harry?" Harry
cursed himself inwardly at the look of terror on the woman's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Its
fine, Ginny's fine," he said hurriedly. "I came home to visit
Teddy."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,"
said Molly, retrieving the laundry hamper. "Well it's wonderful
to see you dear." She patted his shoulder as she walked past and
into the laundry.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
for tea, Mum?" asked Ron lazily as he leant back in his chair.
Molly half turned and smiled at her sons. She shook her head
slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was going to be just me and your father," she said before
disappearing into the small room. She emerged a moment later without
the hamper. "So it was a simple stew."</p><p class="calibre8">"There
is nothing simple about your stews, Mother," said Percy, still
leaning his head on one hand. "They are a work of art."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
you are a flatterer," she skittered, fluttering a hand at Percy.
"I'll have to expand it somewhat for the three of you though. You
are staying, aren't you Percy?" Percy nodded silently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't have any place else to be," he said glumly. Molly moved
forward to pat his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
always have a place here, Percy," she said. "This is your home."
Harry was suddenly embarrassed that he had turned up unannounced.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry I didn't let you know-" he started but Molly cut him off
immediately.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop!"
she said fiercely. Her face softened as she looked at Harry. "You
are always welcome, dear. That's what home means." She squeezed
Percy's shoulder as she said it before turning away and busying
herself at the sink and bustling back and forth from the scullery to
the sink with vegetables. Harry's embarrassment faded and he felt a
sort of warmth spread through his chest as he watched Molly enlarge
the cauldron and begin adding things to it.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
when's Bill coming?" asked Ron after a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill's
coming?" asked Molly absently, spelling the knives to scrape, chop
and peel.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
to talk to me about this werewolf legislation thing," said Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Will
he be here for tea?" asked Molly shooting a jet of water into the
cauldron with her wand and setting a spoon to stirring it.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know," answered Harry. "I didn't think to ask."</p><p class="calibre8">"Never
mind. Ron, Floo your brother, see if he wants tea," Molly
commanded, searching the spice rack and pulling down a large jar of
something green and dried that looked uncomfortably like potions
ingredients. Ron grumbled but shuffled to his feet and did as he was
asked.</p><p class="calibre8">Bill
and Fleur accepted the invitation and Molly had Harry and Percy set
the table and by time Arthur Apparated into the backyard they were
ready to sit down and eat. Arthur proclaimed that seeing Harry was a
lovely surprise and Fleur kissed him on both cheeks and he managed to
blush spectacularly like he hadn't in years. The family sat down to
eat and the silence over George's whereabouts was palpable. Percy
was glum and spoke only to ask for the pepper but Fleur carried on a
cheery conversation about her work at Gringotts. Well it was almost a
conversation and would have been if anyone had answered her.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
ate as though he'd not had a good meal in a week, Molly played with
her food and Arthur nodded absently to Fleur as he ate and looked
over some of the paperwork next to his plate. Harry looked up and
caught Bill's eye and he could see the worry there. Bill smiled
tentatively at Harry but it didn't reach his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"-
and so I said to zee goblins, I will not carry out these tasks for
you! You should make zee new girl do eet! She iz smaller zan me and
will fit down zere much easier!" Fleur let out a tinkling peal of
laughter and there was a chorus of half-hearted laughs but Harry very
much doubted that anyone knew what was so funny. Fleur fell silent
and the only sound was the rustling of Arthur's parchment and the
clink of silverware against the dishes. Harry shifted uneasily as he
ate. Bill cleared his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
how's the first week been, Harry?" he asked. "Have you had a
Defence class yet?" Harry swallowed his mouthful of stew hastily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um,
yeah, it was two days ago," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
it go all right?" Bill prodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um,
well I guess so," Harry mumbled, looking at his stew, suddenly
fascinated by the pieces of carrot floating in it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Go
on, tell him about that Slytherin kid you wiped the floor with,"
interjected Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry?"
Arthur piped up suddenly. "Were you duelling?" Arthur looked
concernedly at Harry, his eyebrows slightly raised.</p><p class="calibre8">"Erm
…" was Harry's only response.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
come on, Dad," said Ron. "It was just a specky, Slytherin git."</p><p class="calibre8">"That
is not the point, Ronald," said Arthur icily. "Why does the floor
need to be wiped with anyone in a classroom? How does that make
Hogwarts any different to last year? I must say-"</p><p class="calibre8">"He
threw a curse at Ginny," Harry blurted and immediately regretted it
when Molly dropped her spoon with a deafening clang against the side
of her bowl.</p><p class="calibre8">"He
what?" asked Bill, leaning forward, his eyes furious.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
was ignoring him," said Harry. "He had his wand on me but then he
turned it on Ginny and when I threw up a shield charm he started
firing over the whole room. Neville couldn't hold a shield over
everyone forever so I … took him out." Harry finished weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are those vicious little animals doing pulling wands on other
students in that school!" exploded Molly suddenly. "Enough! No
more!" Harry didn't know what to say as Arthur reached over to
grasp Molly's arm firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
she shook his hand off, her eyes blazing fiercely. "Why are my
children still in danger?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Molly-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
supposed to be all over, it's not supposed to still keep
happening!" said Molly, her voice rising as she spoke. "They're
supposed to be <em class="calibre9">safe</em>! I want them home!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny's
safe, Mum," said Ron. "Harry's there."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's
looking after Harry?" screeched Molly, turning to Ron suddenly. Ron
snorted loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
there's one thing Harry can do, it's take care of himself," he
said, laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then
how did he end up in the Hospital Wing?" asked Molly coldly. Ron
gulped. "Don't think Professor McGonagall didn't Floo me."
She turned to Harry who shrank down in his chair. He could sense she
was about to coddle him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Leave
him alone, Mum," said Bill idly. "He's a grown man." Molly
sighed heavily and Arthur patted her arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
okay," said Harry. "Really I was only there for maybe … an
hour."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know, I know," said Molly. "It's just … I worry."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
let's worry about George," said Ron suddenly, harshly. The pain
that crossed Molly's face was raw and palpable. Bill flinched and
Arthur closed his eyes and rubbed his hand across his forehead.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong with George?" asked Percy idly, stirring his stew.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
have you forgotten?" snarled Ron sarcastically. "Let me refresh
your memory. OUR BROTHER DIED!" Molly covered her face with her
hands. Ron's face was red with fury and Fleur was pale, her eyes
swivelling from Ron to Percy and back again.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know," said Percy quietly. "I was there." Ron subsided a
little.</p><p class="calibre8">"George
is not doing well, is he?" asked Bill. Ron shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
moved from womanising to drinking," replied Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where
is he now?" inquired Fleur. Ron shrugged and pushed his plate away
resting his elbows on the table and his head in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
thought he was at the pub," Harry volunteered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Found
this one instead," said Ron, raising his head and jerking his thumb
at Percy. "Maudlin drunk he was."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why,
Percy?" asked Molly suddenly, dropping her hands and eyeing her
third son. Percy looked down at his plate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Penelope
…" he trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
she all right?" questioned Arthur carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably,"
shrugged Percy carelessly. "She left and seemed quite happy to do
so."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Percy," sighed Molly. She got up and engulfed her son in a hug. She
pulled back a little and took his face in her hands, examining him
carefully. "I didn't realise. I didn't ask why you were here. I
just … I don't even know how my own children are." Percy looked
at his mother for a moment and Harry saw a glistening tear and roll
down his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
miss her," he said and his mother folded him into a hug, holding
him as sobs wracked his body.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
said Bill softly, indicating they should move into the lounge room.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
weel clean up ze table," Fleur said softly. She began sending the
dirty dishes on the table to the sink. Arthur sat quietly at the head
of the table staring into space and smoothing the edges of his stack
of parchment. Harry followed Bill out of the kitchen, Ron on their
heels.</p><p class="calibre8">Once
in the lounge room Bill began pacing back and forth in front of the
window. The curtains were not yet drawn and Harry could see the stars
and moon which was nearly full. Bill stopped pacing abruptly and
turned to face Harry, his hands shoved deep in his pockets.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
Brown fellow wants to regulate werewolves and anyone who's been
attacked or influenced in any way," he said. "Reckons 'those so
influenced' can't be trusted and says they need to be
institutionalised to keep everyone safe. He wants to lock me up in
case I go nuts at the full moon."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
that's …"</p><p class="calibre8">"The
day after tomorrow," said Bill raggedly, running a hand through his
hair as he turned to look out of the window. The moonlight cast eerie
shadows on his face across his scars. "Brown had one of his goons
in the MLE come down to Gringotts while I was at work yesterday and
ask me all sorts of … personal questions. They asked Fleur … I
found out later, they asked her … about our sexual activity."
Bill finished in a hurry and stopped, flushed and embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
that got to do with anything?" asked Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know," Bill shrugged. "Fleur was so angry she wasn't
making much sense but I think it was questions about if I got
violent. She was spewing forth a string of French obscenities that I
think said something about perversion." Ron snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
they lock you up?" asked Harry. Bill shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
yet, no law that says they can," Bill sighed heavily and continued
quietly. "If I had kids they would try and take them away. We were
going to try for a family soon but … I can't do that until this
is settled. I won't have my children taken away. I can't."</p><p class="calibre8">"Teddy,"
murmured Harry. He looked up at Bill suddenly. "They want to take
Teddy don't they?" Bill nodded slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Andromeda
threw them off the property yesterday," he confirmed. "She sent
Kreacher to Grimmauld Place with Teddy until they were gone."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yesterday?"
questioned Harry. He was scared and incensed. He didn't know which
emotion was stronger and thought he might be in shock. "Yesterday?
And no one thought to tell me y<em class="calibre9">esterday</em>? Where the hell is
Kingsley?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
they can't take Teddy," soothed Bill. "He wasn't in any
danger, Andromeda just sent him away as a precaution."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
his godfather!" shouted Harry. "Why didn't anyone tell me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
sent a message to the Headmistress," added Bill. "She didn't
say anything?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Only
to tell me in a very roundabout way to come see Teddy this weekend,"
admitted Harry. He paused. "But this is why, isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably,"
agreed Bill. Harry sat down abruptly and rubbed a hand over his face
wearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Kingsley's
in Spain," came Arthur's voice from the doorway. "Meeting with
Spain's Minister. He's coming back early tomorrow so he can be
here before the full moon. We're drafting interim orders to pass
tomorrow morning. There's an emergency session of the Wizengamot
and Kingsley plans to have it all in place before Brown can act."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
what does this Brown fellow want?" he asked. "Why is he doing
this exactly?" Arthur sat down opposite him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
know his niece, Lavender, who was attacked by Greyback at … on that
day," Arthur stumbled slightly. "She wasn't hurt at all but he
scared her pretty badly and she's been having some pretty bad
reactions during the Full Moon thinking that he's going to come and
get her as a full werewolf this time."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
Brown thinks if he locks up anyone who's got any sort of vague
connection to a werewolf …" Harry trailed off.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
can't we just tell Lavender that Greyback's locked up and can't
hurt her?" asked Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
he isn't and she knows it," answered Bill quietly. Harry looked
up at him in shock. "He got away. They thought they had him but …"
he shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
how is locking up anyone who's been breathed on by a werewolf going
to help?" asked Harry sarcastically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think people are just afraid, Harry," said Arthur softly. "Brown
thinks it's safer to regulate werewolf influences if he has control
over them."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
no one is taking Teddy," said Harry fiercely. "You shouldn't
take babies away from people who love them - from their family." He
didn't even bother to leave the house before he Apparated straight
into Andromeda's front parlour. He knew it was bad manners but he
didn't care too much for manners just then.</p><p class="calibre8">Andromeda
was sitting in a worn rocking chair near the window; Teddy curled up
in her arms, staring up at the moon. She gave a startled squeak when
Harry arrived suddenly in the middle of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
wondered when you would come," she said as she stood up carefully,
trying not to jostle the baby in her arms. She didn't seem upset
that he had barged his way in or that he had shown up unannounced.
Andromeda crossed the room and stood in front of Harry with her
grandson in her arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
– I'm sorry," Harry whispered as he gazed down at the tuft of
turquoise hair that poked out from the top of Teddy's blanket. "I
should have … I needed to see him." Andromeda nodded and reached
out to put the baby in Harry's arms. She patted his shoulder as she
walked out of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
sank into the rocking chair and settled Teddy on his chest. Teddy let
out a shuddering little sigh in his sleep and cuddled into Harry's
jumper. The tuft of hair on his head turned black and Harry smiled as
he ran a finger softly over the fuzzy head. <em class="calibre9">He knows I'm here</em>,
thought Harry. <em class="calibre9">He knows it's me</em>.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
woke to find himself draped in a blanket. The curtains had been drawn
and most of the candles had been snuffed out. The fire glowed softly
in the grate behind the fireguard. Teddy was gone but a soft light
beckoned Harry towards the kitchen where he found Andromeda rocking
Teddy as Kreacher prepared a bottle.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
watched for a while as a purple haired Teddy raised a pudgy little
hand to grab Andromeda's nose and play with her lips as she sang
him a gentle song. Teddy smiled a toothless gummy grin and let out a
little squeal before turning his hair black. Andromeda laughed and
turned to look at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
evening Sleeping Beauty," she said. Harry smiled sheepishly and
reached out to grasp Teddy's hand which went straight into the
baby's mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ouch!"
he yelped. Andromeda laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
a tooth in there somewhere," she said, "ready to break through.
He's been a little unsettled." Harry held out his hands and his
godson lurched towards him. His grandmother surrendered him and Harry
took a moment to kiss his soft baby skin and hold him close. Fat
little fingers grabbed at his hair and a drooling, slobbery mouth
latched onto his chin. Harry grimaced slightly before pulling Teddy
away. The baby lunged for Harry's robes, grasping a fistful and
chewing on it urgently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Poor
little thing," said Andromeda. "He's chewing everything,
stopped sleeping through the night. It's hard to tell when he needs
pain relief; he can't tell me when the potion's wearing off. All
I can do is hold him." She reached out to stroke his downy head as
Teddy twisted in Harry's grasp, on fist stuffed in his mouth and
drool dripping from it like long silky tendrils.</p><p class="calibre8">"Master
Teddy is wanting his bottle," said Kreacher suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
I give it to him?" asked Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
would you?" Andromeda exclaimed. "He's been so fussy lately. I
spend all my time holding him and it would be a lovely break."
Harry settled into a chair and took the bottle Kreacher held out to
him. Teddy took it eagerly and Harry suddenly felt an overwhelming
gratitude for Andromeda, who cared for Teddy so carefully, so
completely. His throat closed up and his eyes stung with tears.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you," he sad through the fog of emotion, "thank you for taking
care of Teddy; for <em class="calibre9">loving</em> him."</p><p class="calibre8">"How
could I do anything else?" asked Andromeda softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
everyone would," was all Harry said as he watched Teddy's fingers
curl around his own. The baby's eyes fluttered shut as he suckled
and Harry pressed another kiss to his soft baby skin.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
not taking him away,' Andromeda said suddenly. "I won't let him
be raised by people who don't care, who are afraid of him or who
won't treat him the way Remus and Dora would have." Harry looked
up at her. His own childhood ran like a silent film in front of him.
He shook his head to rid himself of the images.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
something happens to me," said Andromeda, clutching his arm
tightly, "please look after Teddy. You have to. He needs to be
loved, he needs a family." Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
won't get away with this," he said as he removed the empty bottle
and stroked the cheek of the sleeping baby. "This sort of prejudice
can't go on. I'm going to the Ministry tomorrow. No one is taking
my godson away from you. They are not taking him away from his
family."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
his family too," said Andromeda softly. Harry smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
he replied. "I think he's asleep."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
put him to bed," said Andromeda carefully taking the sleeping
infant from Harry's arms. "Hopefully he'll sleep for a few
hours."</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
I come back tomorrow?" blurted Harry suddenly, feeling bereft.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
don't have to ask, Harry," she said. "You don't have to ask."</p>
