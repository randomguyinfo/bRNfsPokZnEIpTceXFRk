<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_37">*Chapter 36*: Chapter 36</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Chapter
36. Under the Surface</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry spent a week
trying to be a model patient. It took all his concentration. He was
hoping that by not attempting to break out of the hospital wing early
the matron wouldn't preclude him from the first match of the
season. As he sat glumly on the window seat on Friday afternoon, he
realised it probably hadn't worked. Classes would finish any moment
now and Ginny would be taking the team down to the pitch for a final
practice. With any luck she'd have managed to talk Demelza or Dean
into Chasing so that she could play Seeker. Madam Pomfrey hadn't
given any hint that he'd even be able to go out and watch the game
tomorrow morning.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry stretched his
left arm in front of himself and sighed. A raised, red scar wound its
way across the back of his left hand. The scar disappeared up the
sleeve of his pyjama top. Harry knew it snaked all the way up his arm
to the new skin across his shoulder. Magical means of healing were
much faster than Muggle methods, but even hoping he'd be allowed to
play tomorrow was probably fruitless. Harry leaned his head on the
window and sighed heavily. He was fed up with the hospital wing.</p><p class="calibre8">He hadn't wanted
for company at first. Most of the Weasleys had dropped in for a while
on Sunday to sit with him while he'd dozed on and off between
potions for the pain. Kingsley had stopped by on Monday with <em class="calibre9">The
Daily Prophet</em> which detailed his unfortunate encounter in
horrible and exaggerated detail. Thankfully Neville and Luna had
enough free time to open the avalanche of Owl post that arrived and
to share the mountains of gifts out among the first and second years
who hadn't been able to go to Hogsmeade on the weekend.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione spent a lot
of the time after class sitting with him; but it was Ginny who stayed
until curfew, curled up next to him on the bed while she ploughed
through the notes Hermione had assigned as part of her study program.
Hagrid was conspicuously absent. Molly spent most of Sunday berating
him and he'd spent most of Monday sobbing into his tablecloth-sized
handkerchief. Hermione confessed that she had yelled at him and
Professor McGonagall had called in Professor Grubbly-Plank to take
Hagrid's lessons for the week while he 'sorted out the mess he'd
created'.</p><p class="calibre8">The Quintaped had
been confined and taken to the Ministry but the Committee for the
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures was debating with the Department of
Magical Accidents and Catastrophes who was exactly responsible for
it, while the Aurors tried to find the Unplottable island to take it
home.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's a real
mystery," Ron said with relish when he came to visit on Wednesday
evening. "No one knows where it is, so how the egg got to the Hogs
Head is anyone's guess. Aberforth's dead annoyed with the
investigation traipsing through his pub and Dad reckons there's
something mysterious going on at the Ministry … in the Department
of Mysteries."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, isn't
that where the mysteries are, Ron?" Ginny smirked.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, something
more mysterious… there're Aurors going in and out of there all
the time," Ron said seriously, ignoring her. "Percy came home the
other day, reckoned he heard from Stella, that's his secretary, who
heard from the tea lady at St Mungo's, that there was an Auror on
the first floor who tried to tell the Healers he was bitten by a
Quintaped. Reckons he went to the island to get an egg back in June.
They all thought he was delusional, sent him to the fourth floor.
He's been there ever since."</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope they are
taking him seriously now," sniffed Hermione from behind a large
book titled <em class="calibre9">Ancient Runes: Not as Dull as You Thought</em>.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not really,"
said Ron cheerfully. "He also tried to tell them he'd seen a
Crumple Horned Snorkack when he went to get the Quintaped."
Hermione snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">By the end of the
week the visitors had slowed to almost no one. Harry hadn't been in
any pain for days and he spent most of his time resting dutifully. He
did the homework Hermione brought him, read Quidditch magazines and
slept.</p><p class="calibre8">He was bored.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry didn't
bother to turn around when he heard brisk footsteps. Madam Pomfrey
often came to check on him and change his bandages at this time of
the day. Harry still had his neck bandaged and he waited a moment for
the matron to set out her supplies the way she did every day before
he turned around. When he did turn he was surprised to see that she
was merely standing next to his bed, her usual bottles of potions and
rolls of bandages missing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well Mr Potter,"
said Madam Pomfrey, "best get a move on if you wish me to remove
that last bandage so you can go." Harry stared at her. She motioned
impatiently to the bed. Harry moved over wordlessly and sat down.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm still not
convinced," she muttered as she carefully unwound the bandage from
his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of what?" Harry
asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Headmistress
and Madam Hooch," said Madam Pomfrey, "have asked that I consider
your return to the Quidditch field tomorrow." Harry held his
breath. The matron tilted his chin slightly and peered at the side of
his neck where the Quintaped had attempted to decapitate him. She
then moved to expose his left shoulder, over which she pursed her
lips and muttered unintelligible sounds.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry subjected
himself to a thorough examination which involved several spells, the
movement of his arm into several positions he was sure his arm should
not do naturally and a rather embarrassing visual inspection with his
pyjama top off. Harry did not utter a sound the entire time despite
the uncomfortable nature of most of the examination.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well," Madam
Pomfrey pursed her lips. "Considering that for once, Mr Potter, you
have behaved admirably while in my care and done everything exactly
as you should have done, you may play tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, Mr Potter,
really," the matron said dryly. "Come and see me tomorrow morning
before the game and I will apply some suitable strapping for the
duration of the game to minimise any damage you may sustain by
engaging in reckless flying."</p><p class="calibre8">"What about
practice this afternoon?" Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and
summoned rolls of bandages from her office.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do take it easy,
Mr Potter," the matron entreated him. "The skin on these scars is
still very new. Don't push yourself and stop if you feel any pain."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry could barely
move his left shoulder when she had finished but he dared not
complain. She handed him his robes and some liniment 'for
afterwards' and bustled back to her office muttering about reckless
Quidditch players. Harry grinned at her retreating back, threw his
robes on and hurried out of the hospital wing.</p><p class="calibre8">The castle hallways
were deserted because students were still in classes and Harry made
his way unencumbered up to Gryffindor Tower. He unearthed his
practice robes before painstakingly removing the ones he was wearing.
He grimaced at his reflection in the mirror. He looked paler than he
usually did. The white bandage wound around his neck, across his
torso and down his left arm almost to his fingertips. He looked like
half a mummy, he thought ruefully. His Firebolt was down in the
changing rooms so he pulled the practice robes on, gave up on most of
the fastenings, threw a cloak haphazardly over his shoulders and made
his way to the Quidditch pitch.</p><p class="calibre8">He wasn't sure it
was such a good idea by the time he got there. His shoulder was
aching a little and he was more out of breath than he would have
liked. He'd been through worse, he thought grimly and he really
wanted to play Quidditch. The practice Snitch was loose again and
Harry watched it idly as he waited for the rest of the team. It
didn't take long before they spilled into the changing room,
chattering loudly and laughing. Dean was with them and he stopped
dead when he saw Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"How'd you get
out of Pomfrey's clutches?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
McGonagall," Harry grinned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Guess you won't
need me then." Dean chuckled ruefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Unless you can
put Lucy Grant's feet back on the right legs and stop her
levitating six feet in the air, you stay!" growled Ginny from the
doorway. "There's a reason magic is banned in the hallways!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What happened?"
Kyle Thorpe asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fifth year
Slytherins," Ginny muttered darkly, throwing her bag onto the bench
next to Harry. "They're trying to sabotage the game, I just can't
prove it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" asked
Harry, eyebrow raised. Ginny sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
doing out of the hospital wing?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm better,"
Harry grinned at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"You look pale,"
she said shortly. Harry frowned and glanced at the rest of the team.
They had all turned away and were pulling protective gear and brooms
out of their lockers.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's wrong?"
Harry asked her quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told you,
they're sabotaging it," Ginny said, turning away and opening her
locker violently. Harry stood up and wandered over to lean against
his locker, which was next to hers. They were standing very close and
Ginny was pulling protective gear out of her locker with grim
determination. She turned to look at him, one glove dangling from her
left hand. With her right she reached out to pick up his bandaged
left hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Madame Pomfrey
said I could play as long as I was strapped up," Harry said as she
eyed his hand critically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can you stay on a
broom like that?" Ginny demanded, looking up at him. He nodded but
she only reached out and ran her finger over his neck. His robes hung
partially open and she pulled his collar aside. "You look like a
mummy."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, but I
want to play," Harry said quietly. "I catch with my right hand. I
can do this."</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum's going to
be so mad if you get on a broom right now," Ginny said as she
trailed a hand down his chest, past the bandages and across his warm
skin. He shivered remembering the last time she'd done that. She
suddenly buried her face in his robes and mumbled something
unintelligible.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's not tell
your Mum," Harry grinned cheekily. Ginny looked up at him. She
looked so serious that Harry faltered. "What's wrong?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I got a letter
this morning," she looked away, toying with the glove in her hand.
"You're going to think I'm terrible."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" Harry
asked softly. "I haven't known you to be terrible at anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"You look too
injured to play," Ginny said looking at him seriously. "If I
didn't get this letter I wouldn't let you play."</p><p class="calibre8">"Let me?" Harry
raised his eyebrows. "What's so special about this letter?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's from the
Harpies," Ginny said. She pulled a crumpled piece of folded
parchment from one of her pockets. "They're sending someone out
to watch me tomorrow. They have Chaser openings." She handed him
the letter.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's great!"
Harry exclaimed. His left arm was strapped so tight he found it hard
to bend and he struggled to unfold the letter.</p><p class="calibre8">"See!" Ginny
cried. "You can't even open it! How can you play Quidditch?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But if I don't,"
Harry looked up at Ginny, "you have to play Seeker." She nodded,
looking miserable.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just … I
figured I wouldn't worry about it, you know," she said, staring
at the letter. "Maybe they'd understand, send someone else later.
Maybe they'd even consider me for Chaser based on the way I play
Seeker. Then I thought about getting one of the second years you've
been training … I've been just feeling sick about it all day. I
can't just get one of those second years, who can barely fly, to
play Seeker just so I can show off my Chasing skills.</p><p class="calibre8">"Then Lucy got
hexed and I thought we'd have to forfeit all together. When I saw
you I thought … for a moment I thought … I can play Chaser! But
look at you! You're all bandaged up! You can't play! And I'm
standing here thinking 'I don't care' because with you back on
the team I can be a Chaser." She turned away and yanked some of her
Quidditch uniform viciously out of the locker.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's not
terrible," Harry said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes it is!"
Ginny cried. "What if you … fell off or something?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't fall
off!" Harry said indignantly. Ginny just looked at him. "Well,
maybe I fell off a couple times."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's awful of
me!" Ginny cried, throwing her uniform back into her locker. "I
cannot believe I ever even entertained the thought!" She turned to
Harry. She looked furious.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" Ginny said
forcefully. "It isn't. Look at you! You are covered in bandages!"
She pushed his robes aside and ran her hands over his chest, across
the bandages that Madam Pomfrey had wound around his body.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just to
protect the new skin," Harry said. "I'm fine."</p><p class="calibre8">"You could have
died," Ginny suddenly sobbed. "There was so much blood. I was
kneeling in it!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry reached out
and pulled her close, motioning to the rest of the team to go out
onto the pitch. They left slowly. Harry had not heard anyone speak of
the moment he'd been attacked on the staircase. It had become an
event that everyone skirted around. Professor McGonagall had visited
with him for nearly and hour on Tuesday morning, making small talk
about his grades and Teddy. Hermione talked only of studying and
Neville kept up a monologue about plants whenever Harry tried to ask
what had happened.</p><p class="calibre8">Madam Pomfrey
refused to say more than he was quite fine now. Then she would tip
another potion down his throat before he could ask her anything else.
Dean and Seamus had stopped by Monday night and launched into a recap
of the most recent Puddlemere United game. In the end Harry gave up
trying to find out what happened after he lost consciousness on the
stairs. He had not attempted to ask Ginny after that and she had not
volunteered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shhhhh," Harry
whispered into her hair. "I didn't die. It was just a little
bite."</p><p class="calibre8">"Little?" Ginny
shrieked suddenly. She pulled away from him. "It tore up your arm!
Your robes were shredded and it slashed your neck open. Do you know
how close it was to slitting your throat?"</p><p class="calibre8">"But it didn't."</p><p class="calibre8">"Only because
Neville ran up there," Ginny cried. "He blew it off you with some
blasting hex or something, I don't know. I can't remember what he
said." She shuddered.</p><p class="calibre8">"I tried to go but
… Hermione held me back," Ginny sobbed. "She told me you'd be
safe with Neville. But it was awful and there was so much blood …</p><p class="calibre8">"We didn't know
if you would be all right, you know. Mum and Dad were frantic and Ron
was climbing the walls. We had to wait forever and I was still
covered in your blood …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know it would
have looked bad," Harry said, "but it was just a bite or two,
really."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Ginny
said softly. "Once Madam Pomfrey let us back in she explained that
a lot of it was superficial bites - they just bled a lot - especially
the one on your neck because it got close to some important arteries
and things. The worst was your shoulder, where it took a chunk, she
said she fixed that. It was the blood loss and the bump on the head
that made you pass out."</p><p class="calibre8">"She did fix my
shoulder," Harry said, pulling Ginny close again. "I'm fine,
honestly. She said I could play."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's pretty
soon," Ginny said, running her hands over his bandaged arm. "I
can't believe I nearly talked myself into letting you play, all for
a stupid Harpies tryout opportunity." She shook her head and pulled
away dragging her practice robes out again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe Demelza
will Chase," Ginny sighed. She pushed her locker door closed. "If
I go and talk her into it now we've still got time to practice
before tea." Ginny pulled her hair back into a ponytail and turned
in the direction of the door. Harry reached out and grabbed her with
his left hand. She looked down at where his bandaged hand gripped her
upper arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Play Chaser,"
Harry said. "We've got a Seeker."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm still the
Captain," Harry said quietly. "You don't want to miss this
chance. You play Chaser. I'm the Seeker."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, look at
you," Ginny sighed. "There will be other chances. I'm not going
to put you in any more danger."</p><p class="calibre8">"This is the best
chance you've got," Harry said urgently. "I am not in any pain;
I have clearance from the matron. You have to do this."</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you sure?"
Ginny asked, worrying her bottom lip between her teeth. "You're
not in any pain?" Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I swear," he
replied. "Fit as a fiddle, see?" Harry swung his arm
experimentally. The strapping pulled a little and a dull pain started
in his shoulder but Harry ignored it.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're not
going to cause any more damage?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That's what the
strapping is for," Harry said patiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because my
Quidditch career isn't worth your health."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny," Harry
said. "I can do this. I'm the Seeker. I'm the Captain. You are
our star Chaser; soon to be star Harpies Chaser." Ginny stared at
him, eyeing his practice robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"You couldn't do
your robes up properly, could you?" she asked. Harry shook his
head. Ginny sighed and reached out to properly fasten them. "Please
don't fall off." She looked up at him as she finished smoothing
his robes and Harry smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's go," he
said as he opened his locker and pulled out his own protective arm
guards. He eyed them warily and Ginny took them wordlessly and began
putting them on. Harry smiled at her sheepishly. They followed the
rest of the team onto the pitch.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't fall,"
Ginny said as he mounted his broom. Harry rolled his eyes at her and
took off. For one terrifying moment he thought he was going to fall
off but he righted himself quickly.</p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">That would
have looked bad,'</em> he thought ruefully as he anchored himself
securely, testing how difficult it was to manoeuvre his broom with
his left arm strapped up so securely. It seemed fine as he flew a few
laps of the pitch and took a few sharp turns. Once Harry was in the
air, things loosened up a bit and there was a little more room to
move.</p><p class="calibre8">"Send some
Bludgers at me!" Harry called to the two Beaters. "I want to see
if I can dodge them!" Harry had a few close calls but managed to
dodge them all. The rest of the practice went relatively well, except
when Dean decided Ginny was throwing wrong.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't throw
<em class="calibre9">wrong</em>, Dean," Ginny shouted sarcastically. "You just aim
and throw!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well then your
aim is stupid," Dean said stubbornly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who are you, the
Captain all of a sudden?" Ginny flew over to Dean and hovered,
hands on hips, in front of him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look, I just care
about winning the game-"</p><p class="calibre8">"If you really
cared you'd have tried out for the team!" Ginny shrieked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, and be forced
to continually watch you and Harry-" Dean stopped abruptly and
whirled around, flying swiftly to the ground before dismounting and
stalking towards the changing rooms. Ginny swooped down in front of
Dean, leaping off her broom and turning to face him. Harry watched
from the air as they exchanged heated words.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny shook her head
exasperatedly and started gesturing wildly with her arms, pointing to
the Quidditch hoops, the stands and her broom. Harry was too far away
to hear but he could tell Ginny had convinced Dean to return to
practice. Dean got back on his broom and soared up into the air,
Ginny followed. Harry wondered if she'd told him about the Harpies
letter. He didn't ask either of them and just continued practice
until it was time to go in for tea.</p><p class="calibre8">The rest of the
practice went smoothly. Harry caught the practice Snitch without too
much trouble and his shoulder seemed fine. Unless there were nasty
surprises in the morning, they were a good bet to win the match.</p><p class="calibre8">*************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's first
nasty surprise the next morning was how much he ached. Ginny had
offered to rub in the jar of liniment Madam Pomfrey had given him.
Thinking of the raised, red scars all the way up his left arm and
shoulder, Harry went back to his dorm, claiming fatigue, to unwind
the bandages, on his bed, with the curtains closed. He hadn't
managed to get everywhere with the liniment but he did the best he
could.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry took a deep
breath and eased himself out of bed. The truth was, he felt like
curling up in a comfy chair by the common room fire and not moving
all day; but he showered, dressed in his Quidditch uniform and went
downstairs to breakfast. He wandered into the Great Hall hiding the
discomfort in his shoulder as he forced his left arm to swing by his
side naturally. On the surface his arm and shoulder looked fine but
he could feel the muscles underneath screaming whenever he moved.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good morning,
Harry," Hermione greeted him cheerfully. He waved half-heartedly in
return. Hermione eyed him critically. "Are you all right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,
Hermione," he replied. "I'm great."</p><p class="calibre8">"You look pale,"
Hermione returned bluntly. Harry didn't answer her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron's coming
with his family," Hermione volunteered after an uncomfortable
silence. "So he's not here yet."</p><p class="calibre8">"The Weasleys are
coming?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yes,"
Hermione said briskly, "to watch Ginny. I don't expect they think
you are playing at all."</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably not."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why are you
playing, Harry?" Hermione asked him urgently. "You look dreadful
and you are holding that arm all stiffly."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,"
Harry repeated through gritted teeth. "Madam Pomfrey is going to
put a support bandage on before the game." He swung his left arm.
It hurt like mad but Harry plastered a smile on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why are you
playing?" Hermione demanded again. She eyed him grimly. Harry
debated lying to her again and then thought better of it. He sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny has a
chance to play for the Harpies management," Harry said. "They
have Chaser openings. They are coming to watch Ginny play today.
Watch her play <em class="calibre9">Chaser</em>, not Seeker."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," Hermione
said. She paused. "I won't be able to talk you out of this, will
I?" Harry shook his head. Hermione pursed her lips but did not say
any more. Harry returned silently to his bacon and eggs and Hermione
disappeared behind the <em class="calibre9">Prophet</em>. Ginny joined them a moment
later. She looked preoccupied and absently poured herself a glass of
milk and began to eat her cereal dry. She made a face and spat out
the cornflakes while Harry tried to keep the smile off his face.
Ginny smiled ruefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bit nervous,"
she said, grabbing the milk pitcher and pouring milk into her bowl.
Harry patted her leg comfortingly and excused himself to go to the
hospital wing. Hermione looked up from her newspaper.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Why don't you
come with me, Hermione," Harry interrupted loudly. "You've
finished breakfast."</p><p class="calibre8">"But-"</p><p class="calibre8">"We can talk on
the way," Harry said cheerfully, grabbing her arm and hauling her
out of her seat. Hermione smiled at him sweetly.</p><p class="calibre8">"All right,
Harry," she said through gritted teeth, "if that's what you
want."</p><p class="calibre8">"You all right,
Hermione?" Ginny looked up from her breakfast with a puzzled
expression.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's fine,
she's fine!" Harry said cheerfully. "She's looking forward to
seeing Ron! Well Madam Pomfrey's expecting me, see you later!" He
leant down and gave Ginny a swift peck on the cheek and strode out of
the Great Hall, dragging Hermione with him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What was that?"
Hermione hissed at him, shaking his hand off her arm. She stopped
dead, her hands on her hips.</p><p class="calibre8">"You were going to
say something," Harry hissed back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can you even move
your arm?" Hermione demanded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course I can,"
Harry scoffed, swinging his arm to demonstrate. The muscles screamed
at him and it was with great difficulty that he kept a smile
plastered to his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"You," huffed
Hermione, "are impossible. You're going to regret this."</p><p class="calibre8">"What if Ginny
gets an offer?" Harry asked. "Am I going to regret it then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You could do
permanent damage!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Madam Pomfrey
cleared it," Harry insisted stubbornly. Hermione sighed heavily.
"It'll be fine, Hermione. You'll see." Hermione shook her
head but trotted after him to the hospital wing.</p><p class="calibre8">She waited while the
matron strapped Harry up and tutted under her breath about Quidditch
players. His arm felt a little better with the support of the
bandage, but Harry could tell that by the end of the day it was going
to be on fire. Harry hoped the game was long enough to show off
Ginny's skills but that he could end the game fairly early and
catch the Snitch easily.</p><p class="calibre8">But first he had to
convince Molly Weasley that he was well enough to play Quidditch.</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">It couldn't have
gone worse. Bill saw him first and indicated the bandages, which
could be seen wound up his neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Trying for a
mummy impersonation there, Potter?" he called out as he and Fleur
wandered up from the main gates while Harry and Hermione waited with
Ginny, who was hovering on the front steps like an aimless butterfly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Should 'e be
playing like zat?" Fleur demanded as she reached them. Harry
elbowed Hermione and smiled sweetly at Fleur.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just a
precaution," he said. "Lovely to see you, really glad you could
come." Bill leaned close to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hurts like
blazes, doesn't it?" Bill whispered. Harry smiled frozenly at him
but didn't say anything.</p><p class="calibre8">When Ron turned up
with George and his parents he seemed to be channelling Hermione. He
grabbed Harry and hauled him aside.</p><p class="calibre8">"What in bloody
hell do you think you're doing?" Ron hissed. "You're out of
your mind, aren't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's fine,
Ron," Harry hissed back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know you're a
mental git," Ron continued, "but this is just bonkers, mate."
Harry glared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Potty wee
Potter," George sang, in a perfect imitation of Peeves. "Mum's
about to let you have it."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry endured
stoically as Mrs Weasley lectured him about being careful, the
violent nature of Quidditch and foolish behaviour.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you
absolutely sure Madam Pomfrey meant for you to actually <em class="calibre9">play</em>
in the match?" Molly asked for the third time in as many minutes.
"Your arm is all right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She strapped it
up," Harry explained, not for the first time. Molly pursed her lips
and turned her attention to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now, be careful,
dear," she straightened her daughter's collar. "Are you warm
enough? It's very cold out here."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,"
Ginny muttered mutinously, twisting away from her mother's fussing.
Ron looked at Ginny carefully as she flapped a hand at her mother and
scowled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey Ginny-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Time to go!"
Harry interrupted loudly, grabbing Ginny's hand and pulling her
down the steps. "We'll see you all after the game!" He ignored
the sharp sting in his shoulder as he pulled Ginny hastily after him
and waved cheerily with his right hand before striding briskly across
the lawn.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, bye
everybody!" Ginny called, giggling, before she trotted after Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">The Gryffindor
changing room was a nervous pit of energy. Kyle Thorpe and Brent
Robinson were staring at the door to the pitch, their broomsticks
clutched in their hands. Coote and Peakes were pacing relentlessly on
either side of the room and Dean was sitting on a bench bouncing his
left knee up and down incessantly. He kept blowing bubbles with a
large wad of Drooble's and Ginny was flitting between the toilet
and her locker.</p><p class="calibre8">Only Harry sat
perfectly still. If he sat perfectly still his arm didn't hurt one
bit. He sat on a bench in the middle of the room and breathed slowly
waiting for Madam Hooch to call them for the game.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think
Malfoy even bothered to get a good team up?" Dean asked suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I heard he put
his girlfriend on the team," Kyle volunteered.</p><p class="calibre8">"That priss?"
Ginny turned suddenly. "She's the sort who couldn't bear to
break a nail!"</p><p class="calibre8">"So's Malfoy,"
snorted Dean. Ginny dissolved into a fit of laughter and Kyle and
Brent grinned at her like madmen. Peaks and Coote glanced at them and
resumed their pacing. Ginny sobered and looked seriously at the
gathered players</p><p class="calibre8">"Look, we've
trained for this. I know we probably aren't in the best form, we've
got new players and our Seeker's just out of the hospital wing, but
we are still better than Slytherin," Ginny said. Kyle cheered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah!" said
Brent.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought you
were the Captain?" Dean said leaning over to Harry. "How come
she's giving the pep talk?" Harry looked at Dean for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"She told you
about the Harpies?" he asked in a low voice. Dean nodded. Harry
glanced at Ginny who was trimming the twigs on her broomstick. "This
is her chance. Help her make it happen?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course,"
Dean said. He looked at Harry seriously. "She's bound to look
brilliant next to me though. She always was the better Chaser."</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen, Dean-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry
about it Harry," Dean cut him off.</p><p class="calibre8">"About yesterday,"
Harry persisted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was in a foul
mood is all," Dean sighed. "I thought Susan and I had something
going but … she dumped me … for Goldstein." He grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's too
bad," Harry said as he shifted a little in his seat. Pain shot
through his shoulder and he winced.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're faking
it, aren't you?" Dean asked him in a low voice, turning away from
Ginny. "How much agony are you in anyway?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I'm fine,
just a little twinge," Harry said quickly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't move
without pain, can you?" Dean raised an eyebrow at him. "Maybe-"
Harry shook his head fiercely.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'd have to
forfeit-" Harry was cut off as Madam Hooch pushed open the door and
told them it was time to play. Ginny froze; her broomstick in her
hand. She stared at the door and gulped audibly. Harry fixed Dean
with a meaningful stare, willing him to understand. Dean stood up
swiftly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on Weasley,"
he cried. "Let's go get you on that pro team!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I think I still
have to do a tryout or something," Ginny mumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Trial, tryout,
trifecta!" Dean called as he dragged her out. "Let's go, let's
go, let's go!" Ginny giggled as he caught her arm and turned back
to look at Harry. He smiled at her and gave her the thumbs up,
sighing thankfully when she was out of sight and he could move
gingerly from his seat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right, Harry?" Jimmy Peakes asked him a moment later. "You don't
look at all well."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm … I just
… don't let the Bludgers near me," he said. "I don't know
if I can dodge them by myself."</p><p class="calibre8">"Should you be
playing?" Ritchie Coote asked concernedly. Harry glanced around the
changing room. Kyle and Brent were gone, having followed Ginny and
Dean out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Madam Pomfrey has
cleared me to play," he said carefully, trying not to wince as he
bent to pick up his broom. He could feel them looking at him closely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay, Harry,"
Peakes said quietly. "We'll look out for you." The two Beaters
picked up their brooms and bats resolutely and led the way out to the
pitch.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry gritted his
teeth as he shook hands with Malfoy and the movement sent shockwaves
through his left shoulder even though he had shaken with his right
hand. The weather was cold and blustery and Harry hoped that perhaps
the frigid weather was enough to numb him, perhaps then he would have
less pain. Malfoy fixed him with a predatory glare but Harry didn't
have it in him to reciprocate. He mounted his broom and swooped
around the pitch waiting for Madam Hooch to release the Quaffle.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry adjusted his
seat on his broom and scanned the stands. He could see Professor
McGonagall watching the Chasers intently as they went after the
Quaffle. Ginny seemed to snatch it out of the air and went tearing
down the pitch. Harry saw a couple of unfamiliar faces behind the
Gryffindor goals. They were dressed in neatly-pressed robes the same
colour as the Harpies uniforms. Badges he was too far away to see
glinted on their chests.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny scored the
first goal of the match and Harry heard Malfoy swear as he flew past
him. A massive cheer erupted from the Gryffindor stands and Harry
watched as a group of red-heads in the visitor's box leapt to their
feet. Ginny seemed to block all of that out and was concentrating on
the Quaffle with single-minded determination. Harry hovered above the
play determined to last as long as he could before catching the
Snitch so that Ginny could showcase her abilities.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny scored goal
after goal as Dean fed her the Quaffle, easily keeping it from
Slytherin's grasp and Harry began searching for the Snitch. A fifth
year Hufflepuff called Peterson was giving a dreary commentary of the
game and Harry tuned him out. At one point shortly after Ginny's
fifth straight goal, Harry thought he saw the Snitch and swung around
abruptly, pulling up shortly a moment later when he realised it was
just the weak sunlight glinting off the badges of the Harpies
officials before it vanished behind the clouds. A pervasive chill
settled over the game once more.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry pulled up
short just above the Gryffindor goals and attempted to mask a
grimace. He was startled when he heard Malfoy right behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's wrong
with you, Potter?" The other Seeker sounded almost concerned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing," Harry
replied shortly, ascending a little, then turning to fly back out to
the middle of the pitch. Malfoy followed him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have the Seekers
spotted the Snitch again?" Peterson droned. "It would be exciting
if they did … they are moving very slowly oh look Ginny Weasley's
got the Quaffle again this should be exciting watch this girl go."</p><p class="calibre8">"Your girlfriend's
killing us," Malfoy commented nonchalantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I heard yours was
too scared to break a nail," Harry retorted but he lacked venom, he
didn't have the energy to concentrate on annoying Malfoy. It was
taking all his energy to stay upright on his broom.</p><p class="calibre8">"You look like
Dragon dung, Potter," Malfoy said conversationally.</p><p class="calibre8">"Would you quit
being so amicable?" Harry said irritably. "It disturbs me."</p><p class="calibre8">"It disturbs me
that you look about ready to fall off that broom," Malfoy retorted.
Harry turned to glare at him witheringly and suddenly Malfoy pulled
hard on the handle of Harry's broomstick. Harry yelped in pain and
Peterson applied his dreadfully dull monotone to the action between
the Seekers.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think Malfoy is
trying to push Potter off his broom," boomed the magical megaphone.</p><p class="calibre8">"I am trying to
keep him out of the way of the stupid Bludger, you little turd,"
Malfoy muttered as he ducked the Bludger that whizzed right past
where Harry had been sitting a moment before.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stay alert,
Potter," Malfoy sneered before he zoomed down to berate his
Chasers.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry took a deep
breath and circled the pitch slowly, keeping his eye out for Bludgers
and shouting encouragement to Kyle Thorpe in front of the Slytherin
goals.</p><p class="calibre8">The score was 140-50
when Harry spotted the Snitch. He wove between four Chasers who were
vying for the Quaffle and then dodged a Bludger only to lose sight of
the winged golden ball. He gripped his broomstick tightly, willing
himself not to fall off as he tried to regain his balance. Ginny tore
off down the pitch with the Quaffle and Dean swung by where Harry was
taking several deep breaths.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right, Harry?" he asked in a low voice. However dull Peterson might
be he was apparently very observant.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think Potter
might have been injured in that last play," the Hufflepuff
declared. "He looks like he's about to fall off his broom."
Harry could feel every eye in the Stadium swivel to look at him. He
gritted his teeth and flew over the Slytherin goals and hovered above
the pitch. He groaned as Ginny, distracted for a moment, had her
elbow clipped by a Bludger and dropped the Quaffle. Dean swooped
under her and grabbed it, throwing it through the goals and past the
very ineffective Slytherin Keeper.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny was clutching
her arm and one of the Slytherin's Chasers was bleeding from a cut
lip, thanks to a very accurate shot by Coote.</p><p class="calibre8">"If you don't
call a time out, I will," Malfoy said grimly a moment later as he
flew up to him. "Go get a pain potion or something. You look about
ready to vomit." Harry gestured rudely at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pain potions
knock you out, you git," he hissed. "I'd fall off anyway!"
Malfoy glared at him before signalling Madam Hooch.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry descended
slowly and nearly tumbled off his broom as he touched down near the
rest of his team on the edge of the pitch. A light drizzle was
beginning to fall. Ginny was experimentally bending her injured elbow
while Dean was gesturing urgently to Brent Robinson, the third
Chaser. Peakes sidled up to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right?" he asked. "You look like death."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,"
Harry said. "Malfoy called time out; let's make the most of it."</p><p class="calibre8">"How's your arm,
Ginny?" Harry asked, striding over.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gonna have a
massive bruise," Ginny commented absently as she rolled her sleeve
up to inspect it. "I can't believe I let a Bludger hit me."</p><p class="calibre8">"You two," Harry
barked at Coote and Peakes, "keep the Bludgers away from her. She
can't score with a Bludger through her arm."</p><p class="calibre8">"How are we
supposed to keep them away from both of you at the same time?"
Coote protested.</p><p class="calibre8">"Forget about me,"
Harry said impatiently," I'll dodge-"</p><p class="calibre8">"But Harry, you
said-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Just do it!"
Harry snapped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," Ginny
began warningly. "If you are going to catch the Snitch, you need
the Bludgers off you as well. Don't be an idiot."</p><p class="calibre8">"At the rate, I am
going I'm never going to find the damn Snitch," Harry hissed.
"The rain's starting up, it's getting darker and … just
score, Ginny. We need a big lead."</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right?" she asked him then. She reached out and touched his
bandaged arm. "Is it causing problems?" Harry shook his head
impatiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just a
twinge, no problem," he said. "I've played in weather like this
before; I can't guarantee finding the Snitch and you need to
impress the people from the Harpies. They're behind the goal
posts."</p><p class="calibre8">"I've seen them
there," Ginny nodded. Madam Hooch blew her whistle.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's the
minute whistle; we'd better get up there," Dean commented. Harry
nodded and the rest of the team took off immediately, Ginny giving
Harry a last lingering, worried look. He smiled at her in what he
sincerely hoped was a reassuring manner. Harry was about to climb
onto his broom and follow them into the air when a hand descended on
his shoulder. He spun around to see George, Ron and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's this
about the Harpies?" Ron asked urgently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you in pain,
Harry?" Hermione demanded.</p><p class="calibre8">"They've come to
watch her play," was all Harry responded and made to get on his
broom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!"
Hermione hissed. "We've been watching you. You look dreadful."</p><p class="calibre8">"Fine! All right,
Hermione!" Harry shouted. "I am in a bloody lot of pain and I
feel like my shoulder is on fire."</p><p class="calibre8">"So stop,"
George shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"If I pull out we
forfeit," Harry shook his head. "There are people out there
watching Ginny play so they can offer her a place on a professional
team. I'm playing."</p><p class="calibre8">"Even if you die
trying?" Ron asked. Harry rolled his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's turned
into bloody Oliver Wood!" exclaimed George. Madam Hooch blew the
thirty second whistle and Harry saw the Slytherin players ascend into
the air.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is this worth it,
Harry?" Hermione asked. "If you lose your grip … if you fall …"
Harry grew tired of the questioning.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was bloody
dead, Hermione," he snapped. "This is just Quidditch!" She
stepped back as if stung. Harry swung his leg over his broom, aware
he had only seconds to get back in the air. George put a hand on his
arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hold still,"
George insisted. He took his wand out and was muttered a series of
incantations Harry had never heard before. The pain vanished almost
instantly. He looked up at George incredulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"What did you do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Numbing charms,"
George answered. "Fred's invention. When you know you're about
to test something that might blow up, it's your best friend. It
only lasts about twenty minutes. Hurry up and catch the damn Snitch."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry, able to hold
onto the broom almost normally, flew rapidly up above the play just
in time. The rain was falling heavily now and Harry hoped he'd be
able to spot the tiny, winged ball. Harry watched Ginny pass the
Quaffle almost effortlessly across the pitch, swoop under the goals
and score, again and again. He looked for the Snitch but it was
nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="calibre8">Twenty minutes
passed and then thirty. Harry's fingers were numb and George's
charm work had worn off. Between the ache deep in his shoulder and
his nerveless fingers Harry did not think he could stay on the broom
much longer. Ginny made goal after goal and Kyle made save after
save. The Gryffindor team was up 250-90 when Harry spotted the
Snitch.</p><p class="calibre8">He dove for it, not
caring where Malfoy was. He twisted and turned past the Chasers and
swung wildly around the Quaffle in play. As he ducked both Bludgers,
he dimly heard Peakes smashing at them with a barbaric roar and
Peterson in the stands droning.</p><p class="calibre8">"This is the
single most exciting thing to happen in this game." Peterson's
monotone made watching paint dry sound more exciting. "Harry Potter
has seen the Snitch and is flying to get it."</p><p class="calibre8">As Harry focused his
eyes on the Golden Snitch, everything else faded from view. His
shoulder and upper arm were screaming with pain and his wet fringe
flapped wildly in his eyes. He swiped at it frantically with one hand
and nearly lost his hold on his broom with the other. Tightening his
grip he leant forward, pursuing the tiny, gold ball and ignoring the
sickening tearing sensation in his left shoulder as he twisted around
the goal posts and shot back across the pitch.</p><p class="calibre8">The Snitch hovered
uncertainly in the middle of the playing field and Harry bore down on
it, his left hand slippery with the rain and his right hand
outstretched. The Snitch darted upwards and it was then Harry saw
Malfoy. Harry grinned; he could make it to the Snitch before the
other Seeker. Putting on a last burst of speed and ignoring the
blinding pain in his shoulder, Harry shot upwards lunged forward and
snatched the Snitch out of the air.</p><p class="calibre8">His nerveless
fingers clutched at the handle of his broom but it slipped out of his
grip and his forward momentum sent him hurtling as the Firebolt
seemed to shoot backwards while Harry went spinning in the opposite
direction. Suddenly, with a loud smacking sound and a horrible
crunch, he slammed rib first into the handle of Draco Malfoy's
broomstick. The broomstick lurched violently and Malfoy swore. Harry
scrabbled to hold onto the broomstick as Malfoy grunted with the
effort of holding the broom steady. It was spinning in circles,
creating a downward spiral. They were losing altitude fast and Malfoy
reached out and grabbed hold of Harry's robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hang on, Potter!"
yelled Malfoy, pulling up and trying to slow their descent. He was
partially successful and they landed heavily, but mostly upright, at
the centre of the pitch. Harry tumbled off and fell to the earth in a
muddy heap, wheezing and cursing.</p><p class="calibre8">"You kiss the
Weaslette with that mouth, Potter?" smirked Malfoy. Harry glared at
him, holding his ribs.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think Potter
caught the Snitch but it's hard to tell because he fell off after
that," Peterson's voice droned. "Maybe if Malfoy caught him
then technically Malfoy caught the Snitch I think we will need Madam
Hooch to tell us who the victor is here."</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly
Peterson," McGonagall's voice thundered. "Potter caught the
Snitch first! I don't care what happened to him after that!
Gryffindor wins!" The stands erupted in cheers and Harry noticed
the players begin to land on the pitch and run towards where he and
Malfoy sat, filthy and freezing in the mud.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks, Malfoy,"
Harry said quietly. Malfoy held out his right hand. Harry looked at
it for a moment; he pocketed the Snitch and shook the other Captain's
hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good game,"
Malfoy said. He turned and picked up his broom and then nodded at
Harry briefly before walking off the pitch in the direction of the
Slytherin changing room. Harry watched him go.</p><p class="calibre8">Draco Malfoy had
seemed almost human and … decent.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was brought
back to reality suddenly when he allowed Dean to haul him to his
feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, we did
it!" Dean cried jubilantly. "Four hundred and ten to ninety …"
Harry didn't hear the rest of what Dean was saying because he
suddenly felt very faint and white spots began to dance before his
eyes. He found it difficult to breathe and it was only the burning
sensation in his left shoulder that kept him conscious. Letting out a
strangled yelp, Harry sank to the ground, his left arm hanging
uselessly by his side and his right hand pressed to the spot on his
ribs where he'd hit the handle of Malfoy's broom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't … don't
do that … you git," Harry breathed.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny reached him
next, her long hair flying behind her as she ran towards him. She'd
thrown her broom aside as soon as she dismounted and came skidding to
stop beside him, spraying mud all over him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" she
cried, dropping to her knees. "Are you all right?" Harry looked
up at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think … I
think I cracked a rib," he wheezed, then coughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're awfully
pale," Ginny said worriedly. "How's your shoulder? You're
shivering."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you think …
will they like you?" Harry asked. "The Harpies?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who cares?"
Ginny cried, feeling his forehead the way her mother did whenever she
checked one of her children for a fever. Harry closed his eyes only
to open them a moment later.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're bloody
mental!" Ron muttered as he dropped to his knees on Harry's left
side. His family was crowding around behind him. "I thought you
were a goner, going for that Snitch! Did you know you were actually
swaying in the breeze at one point? I'm surprised you didn't fall
off earlier, you great, bloody git!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ronald!
Language!" Molly reprimanded him. She peered at Harry concernedly.
"You do look a bit pale, dear. Can you stand?" Harry shook his
head ruefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can walk but I
don't think I can get up," he wheezed before coughing painfully.
"Ribs."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's all
right, Harry," said George cheerfully. "We'll set you on your
feet and then you can go to the party and be hailed as man of the
hour … again." He crouched down and picked up Harry's limp left
arm and attempted to drape it over his shoulder. Harry bit back a
yelp and groaned. His shoulder was agony and he closed his eyes and
tried to breathe deeply, which proved completely impossible with
cracked ribs. He began to hyperventilate.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sweet Merlin,"
breathed Molly. Harry opened his eyes and looked over at George whose
hands were covered in blood.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's
bleeding?" Harry asked. His own voice sounded distant. He felt Ron
tear frantically at the sleeve of his scarlet Quidditch robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are!" Ron
cried. "You're a mess." Harry didn't think to protest when
Ron scooped him up and cradled him in his arms.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bloody hurts,"
Harry grunted, closing his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably ripped
it open, you great prat," Ron grumbled as he strode towards the
changing room.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can walk,"
Harry said half heartedly. Ron grunted and shouldered the door to the
changing room open. Harry heard the rest of the family trooping in as
Ron set him carefully on the bench in the middle of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did someone get
Madam Pomfrey?" Ron asked as he began to peel back Harry's
Quidditch robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill went,"
Ginny said softly. Harry opened his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"When do you think
you'll hear?" he asked, wincing as Ron pulled off the protective
gear from his left arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hear what?"
Molly asked as she hovered over them like an overanxious mother hen.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Harpies were
at the game today," Ron said as he dropped Harry's gloves and arm
guards on the floor. "They were here to watch Ginny, which is why
our hero here insisted on playing." Ron yanked on the sleeve of
Harry's robe, pulling it off to expose the spreading crimson stain
on the white bandages. Harry yelped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!" Ginny
cried, her hands flying to her mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"You bloody, noble
git," muttered Ron, shaking his head. Harry said nothing. Ginny
moved over and elbowed Ron out of the way. She knelt beside him and
reached out to caress his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"I knew I
shouldn't have let you play," she whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">I'm</em> the
Captain," Harry whispered back.</p><p class="calibre8">"Idiot," Ginny
said, running her hands through his sodden hair, stroking it back
from his forehead.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was worth it,"
Harry said softly, ignoring the fact that the Weasleys were all
standing around. "You played brilliantly. There's no way they
won't take you." Ginny said nothing, she just ran her hands
through his hair and Harry leaned forward to rest his head oh her
shoulder, sighing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">It was only a moment
before Madam Pomfrey came bustling in. She took one look at Harry,
pursed her lips in a very unpleased manner and ordered everybody out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, you too,
Miss Weasley," she said briskly as she waved her wand in
complicated patterns over Harry's ribs. "Five cracked ribs, Mr
Potter?" She raised an eyebrow at him as the door swung shut on
Ginny. Harry closed his eyes as Madam Pomfrey transfigured the bench
into a bed she was able to work on and Harry lay back so she could
heal his ribs.</p><p class="calibre8">The matron checked
him over thoroughly before she began to remove the bandages from his
torn and bloodied left side. Harry hissed as the air hit the raw skin
and the torn, jagged edges of reopened scar tissue. He was glad Ginny
had gone- he didn't want to look at the scars and he didn't want
her to see them at all. He felt completely irrational; it wasn't as
though he didn't have any scars already.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry couldn't
hold back the short, bitter laugh that turned into a hiss as Madam
Pomfrey cleansed and healed the reopened wound on his shoulder. She
worked steadily down his arm, muttering under her breath as she
repaired the damage caused by his reckless flying.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are not to
get on a broom again until I say so," she said, bandaging his neck,
shoulder and arm with a series of dressings that covered the worst of
his injuries. "And don't be expecting anything before Christmas!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry nodded meekly.
He knew he'd probably be irritated with that rule well before
Christmas, but he had little desire at that moment to do anything but
rest. He closed his eyes and let sleep wash over him as the matron
worked steadily on his injuries.</p>
