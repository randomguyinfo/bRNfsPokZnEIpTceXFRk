			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">37.
Misunderstanding</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Winter set in with a
new vigour after that first game of the Quidditch season. The
November days grew shorter and darker, the castle providing
protection from the howling winds, if not the bitter cold. Hermione
started keeping her ink bottles on the mantelpiece in the common room
to stop them freezing and Neville moved half the greenhouse into the
seventh year boys' dormitory where he could keep an eye on the
plants. Madam Pomfrey was amazed that Harry hadn't done more damage
to his injuries. She kept Harry in the hospital wing for only a day
after his Quidditch mishap before she said he was cluttering up her
hospital wing, lectured him for half an hour and sent him on his way
saying he was very lucky indeed.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Draco
Malfoy maintained an uneasy truce following the Quidditch match,
turning in a completed Potions assignment that garnered them an 'O'.
Harry wondered if Malfoy's overly-friendly actions during the match
had been to salvage his Potions grade. For some reason, even though
the project was over, neither Harry nor Malfoy attempted to move to
sit next to other people during the class.</p><p class="calibre8">One afternoon in
late November, Harry was lounging on the hearthrug in the Gryffindor
common room while Hermione tried in vain to impress upon him the
merits of extra study for his NEWT year. Ginny was down at the
Quidditch pitch having taken over the training the group of first and
second years because Harry wasn't allowed to fly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sometimes I don't
know why you bothered to come back if you are not going to take
things seriously!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,"
Harry said patiently as he flicked through one of his text books,
idly looking for references to use in a Muggle Studies essay, "I
take a lot of things very seriously. Just because they are not the
things you would take seriously doesn't mean I don't."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't say
you don't take anything seriously," Hermione protested. "I just
think you could exert just a little more effort on your studies-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop picking on
me just because you miss Ron," Harry grumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I didn't
send him to Egypt with Bill," Hermione muttered, turning the pages
in her own text book viciously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Neither did I!"
Harry protested. "He went all by himself!" Hermione huffed and
fell silent.</p><p class="calibre8">In an effort to
figure out how to track down some of the missing parents Seamus and
Dean had listed, Harry had asked Arthur where to start.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't really
know, Harry," Arthur said thoughtfully as they sat down to eat one
evening with Bill and Fleur at the Burrow. "I guess if you know
where they went it'd be easier but then you wouldn't be looking
would you?" Harry smiled wryly.</p><p class="calibre8">"This one kid …
think he's a Ravenclaw, he has this little tin," Harry said. "No
one knows if it really came from his dad but he reckons it does."</p><p class="calibre8">"What tin is
this?" Bill asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably a
tobacco tin," Ron mumbled through a mouthful of potatoes before
swallowing. "I talked to Everard Fingleman and it's got a lock of
hair in it. He said it's a bit odd because his dad doesn't smoke.
But he's convinced it came from his dad."</p><p class="calibre8">"How did it get to
this … Everard, was it?" George inquired.</p><p class="calibre8">"Owl post,"
answered Harry, "just turned up one day apparently."</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe he's with
someone else who does smoke?" George shrugged. "Who's hair?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Dunno,"
answered Ron, "says it looks like his dad's but his mum says he's
daft because she reckons there's no way his dad got to Egypt."</p><p class="calibre8">"Egypt?" Bill
looked up suddenly. Ron nodded, spearing more meat from the platter
in the middle of the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"This tin, it's
got funny sort of writing on it," Harry explained, "and his mum
says it's Egyptian."</p><p class="calibre8">"I could come up
to Hogwarts and have a look at this tin," Bill said, "might be
able to find something out. It stands to reason, if they've been
living in hiding they may not realise it's safe to come back. They
may even be having difficulty getting home"</p><p class="calibre8">Bill had come to
Hogwarts and spoken to Everard. Within days he'd made plans to go
to Egypt to try and find out if any of Britain's missing wizarding
folk were still living there in hiding. He left for Egypt with Ron
soon afterwards. Percy had promised to look in on George, who was
spending half his time inventing crazy joke products that would never
sell and the other half pining over Angelina.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wrote her a
poem," George confessed to Harry the previous weekend while Harry
had been at the Burrow for dinner after visiting Teddy. "It was
rubbish."</p><p class="calibre8">"Just talk to
her," Harry shrugged. George looked at him as if he were mad.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry dear,"
Molly had interrupted, "are you quite recovered from playing that
silly game while still injured?" She peered at him as she set a
plate heaped with roast beef and vegetables, dripping with gravy, in
front of him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,"
Harry replied. Molly felt his forehead as though he were a small,
sick child and harrumphed emphatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I still don't
now what Ginevra was thinking, letting you play," she said,
forcefully placing a pitcher of pumpkin juice on the table. "She
blames herself, of course. As well she should, I would think. You
could have really hurt yourself. You might have permanently damaged
something! And for what, a silly game of Quidditch?" Colour began
to rise in Molly's cheeks, indicating her extreme displeasure.</p><p class="calibre8">"It wasn't for
just a game, Mum," George interjected. "She was playing for a
chance with the <em class="calibre9">Harpies</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not worth
Harry's health, it's not even something she <em class="calibre9">needs</em> to do!"
Molly protested, stabbing a finger towards George before turning
again to Harry. "Madam Pomfrey said you were lucky not to have
caused a real problem. She's still not sure how you managed to
play. The pain alone should have stopped you. It's why she never
offers numbing charms, although I understand they are used
extensively in the League. There's more than one player who's
pushed themself beyond the point of reasonable repair by masking the
pain. The matron swears she didn't give you any sort of pain
numbing charm to help you through and Merlin knows I asked her until
I was blue in the face!" Molly took a deep breath and sighed as she
sat in her chair and Harry shared a guilty look with George.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's very
worrisome to get called to Hogwarts in the middle of the night
because one of your children is injured," Arthur added as he sat
down. "This looks wonderful, Molly dear!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But I'm not-"</p><p class="calibre8">"As good as,"
Molly said, thrusting the basket of bread rolls under his nose and
looking at him pointedly. "Professor McGonagall called us
straightaway when that nasty creature attacked you. She knew you'd
need family with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I would have been
fine," Harry muttered. "Ginny-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Could not have
coped alone, Harry," Arthur interrupted gravely. "She was very
upset when we arrived. And no wonder, so much blood …"</p><p class="calibre8">"She was very
vulnerable," Molly mused as she took a sip of her drink. "I've
not seen her so … so … it was as if something had happened; made
her … more sensitive to your distress." Molly looked at Harry
thoughtfully over the rim of her goblet and Harry swallowed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know she's
always felt keenly about the pain of others, Molly," Arthur said
patting her hand and spearing a potato with his fork. "This is
wonderful gravy, dearest." Harry hastily tucked into his own meal,
murmuring compliments along with Arthur and George.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sighed as he
returned from his reverie, wondering if Molly knew the cause of
Ginny's heightened concern that night. He stared at the cover of
the Muggle Studies text book. It was an ugly dark green and the title
'<em class="calibre9">Muggles and their Machines</em>' was inscribed in gold in
flowing script. Life seemed to be going on, unruffled and smooth but
he could feel the undercurrents flowing underneath it all. Percy was
falsely cheerful but it was obvious he missed Penelope terribly and
was suffering from loneliness. George laughed as he reported Stella
had set Percy up with a witch but she'd been all lipstick and high
heels. Not Percy's type at all.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron seemed unsettled
at the shop with George, which was why he'd jumped at the chance to
go to Egypt with Bill. Harry suspected Ron was just having a hard
time adjusting to being apart from Hermione. Ron loved using Wheezes
to prank Harry whenever he stopped by the shop in Diagon Alley and
was always willing to show him the new inventions. It was entirely
possible Ron just needed to get away from George's terrible poetry.
Fleur had moved into the Burrow to keep Mrs Weasley company while
they were gone.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">She spends all
day just sitting</em>, Arthur had written in a letter to Ginny, asking
her to write to her mother more often. <em class="calibre9">She misses her children and
I'm so busy trying to help at the Ministry. Please, don't forget
your mother.</em> For her part, Ginny made time to write to her mother
almost every day but Harry often watched her struggle to find things
to say. Yesterday had been one of those days.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just don't
think she wants to hear about Quidditch training," Ginny said,
throwing her quill down in frustration. She was still waiting to hear
from the Harpies and had thrown herself relentlessly into training,
spending hours out on the pitch with anyone who'd go down there
with her to throw Quaffles back and forth. Harry spent some
afternoons sitting in the stands just watching her fly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She doesn't
want her only daughter to be a Quidditch player," Ginny continued.
"She absolutely let me have it after the game the other day. '<em class="calibre9">How
could you, Ginevra! Fancy putting Harry at risk for some silly notion
of a Quidditch career!</em>' It took all of us to convince her it
was your fault! Honestly, the woman thinks you can do no wrong!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What does she
want you to do?" Harry asked as he doodled in the columns of his
notes. Ginny sighed heavily and put her elbows on the table, resting
her chin in her hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, she's
never really been against a career," she said. "It's not that
exactly. She's always been very supportive of a witch having a
career, being able to support herself. I think it's just … it's
because of you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Me?" Harry
asked indignantly. "What did I do?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing bad,"
Ginny reached out and smoothed his left shoulder. Harry flinched. It
didn't hurt but he felt very uncomfortable about her touching it.
What if she noticed the jagged scars left from the Quintaped and the
ugly tear in the new skin? He didn't see Ginny frown at him but he
knew she was.</p><p class="calibre8">"Does she think I
don't want you to have a career?" Harry asked. He kept his eyes
on his doodling.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," sighed
Ginny, "not exactly. It's more that she thinks you deserve some
kind of sainted homemaker to provide you with pipe and slippers."
Harry snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"What on earth
would I do with a pipe and slippers?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She just wants
the best for you like she does for all of us," Ginny smirked.
"You're lucky she thinks I'm the best thing for you." Harry
looked up at her and smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's not wrong
there," he whispered. Ginny leaned in to give him a kiss. Harry
sighed against her mouth and wound one hand into her fiery hair. She
reciprocated, a small, soft hand coming up to tangle in the locks of
hair at his collar before sliding round to the side of his neck and
down.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt her
fingertips glide over the raised angry scar on his neck and pulled
away. He studied the wood grain on the table, not looking at Ginny.
He knew she was looking sadly at him because she did that every time
he pulled away from her embrace when she got to close to the scars
from the Quintaped.</p><p class="calibre8">It was pathetic,
Harry decided. He had countless other scars and she had seen them
all, traced every single one of them with her fingers and kissed the
length of them, but she hadn't seen these ones. He was grateful for
winter and the excuse it gave him to wear long sleeves, scarves and
gloves.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," Ginny
said softly. Harry didn't want to look at her; answer her
questions. He fiddled restlessly with his quill.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll write to
your mum tonight, if you like," he said, sliding her parchment
across the table. He reached for the ink bottle, his left arm
stretching out in front of Ginny and the shirt sleeve riding up a
little. Harry closed his fingers around the ink bottle just as she
closed her fingers around his wrist. Harry stilled, staring at her
fingers clutched around his bare wrist.</p><p class="calibre8">He watched
mesmerised as Ginny used her other hand to pry the ink bottle from
his fingers and spread his hand out to trace the scars that ran
across the back of his hand and around onto his palm. He shivered at
her touch.</p><p class="calibre8">"Does Madam
Pomfrey think they'll fade?" Ginny asked him quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
answered in a husky voice. "It'll take longer since I ripped so
many of them open." Ginny's fingers had moved to trace the scars
that nearly encircled his wrist. Her fingers danced over his pulse
making his heart beat faster.</p><p class="calibre8">"She gave you an
ointment to use?" Ginny persisted as her nimble fingers deftly
undid the button on the cuff of his shirt. Harry squirmed
uncomfortably. They were in the middle of the common room and not
only was she touching the scars he hid so carefully from her but she
was exposing them for the entire room to see. Harry pulled his arm
away, tucking it into his side and looking furtively around the
common room to see if anyone had noticed.</p><p class="calibre8">"She gave me
ointment, yes," he said, straightening the parchment with the
beginning of Molly's letter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Any trouble
putting it on?" Ginny asked lightly, handing him the ink bottle.
Harry shook his head and bent over the letter, determinedly writing
an amusing anecdote about Dora chasing a Bowtruckle behind Hagrid's
hut.</p><p class="calibre8">The truth was Harry
wasn't having a great deal of success with the ointment on his
shoulder but asking for help meant showing it to someone and Harry
felt strangely reluctant to expose the ugly red, raised marks that
now adorned his arm and shoulder. He found himself staring into the
fire, the Muggle Studies text book lay forgotten on the hearth rug.</p><p class="calibre8">A commotion at the
portrait hole drew his attention. It was Gerald and Gilbert Chumley –
arguing loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's
just beastly of you!" Gilbert shouted, tears in his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm just
stating reasonable fact," Gerald replied. "If we are to move into
a regular neighbourhood then it follows that we should become regular
people."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't want to
go home to some stupid flat," Gilbert screeched. "I want to go
home to our little house with all our things and all <em class="calibre9">Dad's
</em>things …"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's magical,"
Gerald said flatly. "Do you really expect mother to remain there?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She doesn't
want to leave, either!" Gilbert cried. "This is going to be the
worst Christmas ever!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Come now,
Gilbert," Gerald said in an annoying paternal tone. "Nothing will
be achieved with tears. I am sure it will not be as bad as you think.
I believe we will enjoy returning to our normal roots – our
maternal heritage. It has been a lark experiencing father's world
and now we can return to the real world."</p><p class="calibre8">"I hate you!"
Gilbert screamed before tearing up the stairs and banging the
dormitory door closed with a resounding crash.</p><p class="calibre8">Gerald sighed and
took a cursory look at the parchment in his hands before discarding
it in a nearby rubbish bin and exiting the common room. Harry leapt
to his feet and fished the parchment out of the bin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!"
Hermione hissed. "Should you be reading that?" Harry shrugged and
spread the crumpled parchment out on a nearby table.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">My Darling Boys,</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">I wanted to write
and let you know what has been going on here at home while you have
been away at school. I hope you are both well and minding your
manners the way I taught you. It's strange not having you here but
I know you are in the best place and learning all the things your
father wished to teach you.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">There has been no
word on your father's whereabouts. Aunt Gloria has done all she can
but says the Ministry place is just too confused at the moment and
they simply don't know where your father is or when he was last
seen. Gilbert, honey, I know you wanted to see him again but I just
don't know what to tell you. I'm not giving up but there is
little I can do. He would have contacted us by now if he was able. A
part of me will always hope but maybe we have to move on, my dears?</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">And now I come to
the sad news of this letter. I'm packing up this little house. It
is in your father's name and his Galleons paid for it. The goblins
aren't getting paid and haven't since your father vanished. They
need to settle the account. I cannot pay, I have barely enough for
your tuition and food with the money I make at the café in the
village and even they have let me go because business is not as brisk
in the winter. I will probably be able to pick that up again in the
spring, they say.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">I've found us a
dear little flat. It's not so much in the village as in town but
that will be a new excitement all its own, won't it boys? It's
not magical, of course, but we'll do our best in with the Muggles,
'eh? I'm sure I can show you the ropes; it's not at all hard. I
can't wait to see you for Christmas. I just know you're going to
love living in the flat. It's got a little bedroom for you and a
wonderful view on the days the factory isn't going.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">I love you, I'm
counting down the days until Christmas holidays, Love, Mum.</em></p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, that's
terrible," Hermione cried.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thought we
shouldn't be reading it?" Harry smirked at her. Hermione merely
sniffed and turned away.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's awful,"
Hermione muttered, beginning to pace. "She's lost her husband and
now her home and her job. How will she keep sending the boys here?
Gerald is still so resistant but he's actually a very talented
wizard, Harry. I've seen him practicing some of his Transfiguration
homework. He's probably gifted in that area."</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope Bill has
some luck in Egypt," Harry said, folding the parchment carefully.
"We've got to do something. It's frustrating just sitting
around, waiting."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're not just
sitting around," Hermione said patiently. "I know how much effort
you've been putting into fixing up Grimmauld Place. How is it all
going?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You've no idea
how odd it is to see Kreacher excited," Harry laughed. He's been
working like a demon. I keep telling him to slow down but …"</p><p class="calibre8">"I hope he's not
overworked, Harry." Hermione eyed him disapprovingly. Harry rolled
his eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's not,
Hermione," he said patiently. "He's enjoying the work and he's
talking about having the children there to brighten the place up. I
think Teddy's softened him up."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is Andromeda
coping without him there so much?" Hermione sank down onto the
couch in front of the fireplace. Harry joined her, stretching his
feet out towards the warmth.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think she is,"
he replied. "She's stronger now than she was right … after and
Teddy's getting older. I think she takes him over to see Molly a
fair bit. They probably spoil him to pieces. I'm glad he doesn't
have to stay in a Children's Home though. I know that sounds
dreadful, I mean, I plan to start one! It's just … I'm glad
he's got family who love him."</p><p class="calibre8">"It doesn't
sound bad," Hermione said softly. "No one wants children in a
cold, impersonal orphanage or something." Harry sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't want
Grimmauld Place to be like that," he said distantly. "How do you
make it like a home instead of like … like …"</p><p class="calibre8">"An institution?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
agreed. "What do I know about it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I think the most
important thing is love, Harry," Hermione said. She laid her head
on Harry's shoulder. "I don't think you have anything to worry
about."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I only have
to convince Kreacher to get rid of Mrs Black in the entrance and find
someone to run it," Harry said softly. "I don't think
Kreacher's quite the one for the job." Hermione snorted and Harry
laughed. They sat in silence for a moment, the hum of the common room
growing louder as it filled with students coming inside from the
lengthening shadows.</p><p class="calibre8">"I miss Ron,"
Hermione sighed suddenly. Harry looked down at her. She was staring
into the fire and she looked small and sad.</p><p class="calibre8">"He'll be back
soon," Harry said, slipping an arm around her shoulders. "He
hasn't gone for long."</p><p class="calibre8">"No, it's not
that he's in Egypt," Hermione shook her head. "It's that he's
not here and I can't see him every day."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," said
Harry heavily. "I know what you mean."</p><p class="calibre8">"You have Ginny,"
was all Hermione said.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not the
same," Harry replied. "And anyway, I didn't have her all last
year. I know what you mean."</p><p class="calibre8">"Then why are you
shutting her out?" Hermione asked, her head still on his shoulder.
Harry stiffened. He forced himself to relax.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
what you mean," he said casually.</p><p class="calibre8">"How's your
shoulder?" Hermione asked. Harry was glad she was still looking
into the fire and he fixed his eyes there as well.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's fine,"
Harry replied. Hermione snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Any problem with
the ointment?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why won't you
show anyone?" Hermione lifted her head and he could feel her gaze
on him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I don't
normally go around taking my shirt off," Harry attempted a laugh,
"especially not in winter."</p><p class="calibre8">"You cover your
hand and your neck," Hermione observed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, well, maybe
I'm sick of people looking at my scars," Harry muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"No one notices
them, Harry," Hermione said, "least of all Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"You've really
lost your mind," Harry grumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're pushing
her away," Hermione said forcefully. Harry opened his mouth but
Hermione cut him off. "Don't think she hasn't noticed."</p><p class="calibre8">"What has she
said?" Harry forced himself to sound casual.</p><p class="calibre8">"She hasn't <em class="calibre9">said
</em>anything," Hermione scoffed. "I can <em class="calibre9">see</em> it."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry said nothing,
staring into the fire absently. What Hermione said was true. It had
been all over school that he'd been attacked by Hagrid's
Quintaped and all the first and second years who'd stopped staring
at him had taken to staring at him again. Harry couldn't walk
through the corridors, eat a meal or sit in the library without
feeling as if half the school was watching him. He felt like everyone
was peering at him, wanting to find the evidence of his encounter.
There was nothing cool or remotely interesting about the bite scars
on his arm. Harry took to wishing people would stare at his forehead
and shied away from everyone, usually studying in the common room and
often retreating to his dormitory.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know I'm not
exactly into hanging out with everyone right now," Harry admitted.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't mean
hanging out with everyone," Hermione said gently. "I mean Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
what you mean," Harry protested. "I hang out with Ginny all the
time." Hermione shook her head slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I saw how you two
were that week in the hospital wing," she said softly. "You were
closer than you've ever been."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked away
from Hermione's penetrating gaze. It was true enough. Harry had
felt overwhelmed by the feelings he experienced when he had woken up
in the hospital wing that first morning to find Ginny sitting next to
his bed. She was reading the newspaper and eating her breakfast, a
piece of toast in one hand and her wand stuck behind her ear the way
Luna's often was. Harry had stared at her for a while, watching as
she turned the page and tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear.
Ginny looked up and their gazes locked. She smiled shyly and flushed
a little as if she suddenly remembered the intimacy they had shared
the night before.</p><p class="calibre8">They <em class="calibre9">had</em> been
closer since that night, until Harry had left the hospital wing the
second time and suddenly become conscious of his scars.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know something
changed," Hermione said, breaking into his thoughts. "I could see
it in the way you looked at her."</p><p class="calibre8">"We …" Harry
trailed off, not knowing what to say, how to describe it.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know,"
Hermione smiled. She reached across and took his left hand in hers.
"But now, since the game …" Harry held perfectly still as
Hermione traced the scars on his hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"We haven't
since … I just …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Let her in,
Harry," Hermione said softly. "The scars don't matter."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, I just …
I have a lot of scars," said Harry quietly, turning his hand over
in Hermione's and staring at the marks dotting his palm. "I just
keep collecting them. One day it's going to be too many."</p><p class="calibre8">"Too many for
what?" Hermione asked. "You can't think Ginny cares about how
you look?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Harry
sighed, "that's not what I meant." He stood up and began pacing
in front of the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"What is it
Harry?" Hermione watched him from her seat on the couch.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't want
anyone to see them," Harry said, running a hand haphazardly through
his hair. "What if one day … it's another reminder that I'm
reckless? What if one day it's too many scars, too many injuries?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny really
loves you," Hermione said. She smiled cheekily. "She knows you
collect scars." Harry laughed weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't really
open up well to people," Harry said slowly. Hermione snorted. "It
means opening up, Hermione." Harry turned to her, pleading; he
wasn't sure what he was pleading for. Hermione stood up and grabbed
both his hands in hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," she
said, "this is Ginny. Opening up to her is … she's who you
always open up to. If you can't open up to Ginny …"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's my world,
Hermione," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know,"
Hermione said, squeezing his hands in hers. "That's why you have
to let her in. Haven't you already given her everything?" Harry
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I gave her my
heart," he whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"She gave you
hers," Hermione said. "She gave you <em class="calibre9">everything</em>. Don't
take that away from her. Nobody loves you like Ginny. You can share
anything with her; even these scars. There will <em class="calibre9">never </em>be too
many scars for Ginny."</p><p class="calibre8">"There's so
many, they're so …" Harry trailed off, pacing nervously. "Molly
said she blamed herself after the game."</p><p class="calibre8">"She does,"
Hermione nodded. "She knows you played that game for her. I think
that's why she's training so much. If she gets an opportunity
with the Harpies and doesn't make it, she'll feel like she let
you down."</p><p class="calibre8">"It was <em class="calibre9">my
</em>decision, Hermione," Harry said urgently. He ran his fingers
through his hair, pulling at the ends.</p><p class="calibre8">"She knows that,"
Hermione said patiently, "but she also knows you did it for her."</p><p class="calibre8">"But-"</p><p class="calibre8">"She won't
care," Hermione said urgently. "Don't you dare say they'll
matter to her. She won't care if you're reckless, it won't
matter what they look like. She only wants you back. Can't you see
her? The way she looks when you pull away?" Harry nodded. He saw
the sadness – before Ginny could hide it – when he turned away
from her touch, when he pulled away from a kiss.</p><p class="calibre8">He hadn't touched
her beyond holding her hand and kissing her briefly since he'd left
the hospital wing after the game. He would twist away whenever she
went to his left side and make excuses not to cuddle. Harry wanted to
touch her. He wanted to stroke her face and run his hands through her
hair while she kissed him. He remembered the feel of her hands
splayed across his chest and around his waist as he explored her
body. She'd given it to him freely and he'd offered his own. She
wanted him, scars and knobbly knees notwithstanding.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry remembered how
she'd kissed and caressed him. The closeness he felt the next day
after they had shared such physically intimate moments was fading and
he missed it. He missed her. If she felt half the way he did …
Harry dropped back onto the couch with a groan. Hermione sank down
onto the couch next to him and sighed heavily. She curled her legs up
under herself and put her head on his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"It'll all work
out, Harry," she said. "You'll see. Just talk to her." Harry
made a non-committal noise in his throat and let his head fall back
on the couch. He searched desperately to change the topic of
conversation. His mind drifted to Hallowe'en and how he and Ginny
had darted behind the portrait of the man with sandwiches, Ginny
giggling madly as he kissed her palm theatrically and quoted some of
the Muggle poetry they'd been studying.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shall I compare
thee to a summer's day?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You could, I
guess …"</p><p class="calibre8">"You're firey
enough," Harry whispered as he pulled her close and kissed her.
Ginny laughed breathlessly and tugged him up the stairs. As they
spilled through into the first room Harry watched as the light seemed
to spill magically from what had to be an enchanted chandelier.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wonder what
happened to her?" Ginny asked. Harry looked down. She was standing
in front of the picture of Glenda Gryffindor. "It's a lovely
necklace; do you think it was special?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I've got that
necklace," Harry blurted. "I found it in here the other day."</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" Ginny
stared at him. Harry drew his brows together in confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I did have
it," he said, "and then … I was in the hospital wing so …"</p><p class="calibre8">"Madam Pomfrey
will know where it is," Ginny said.</p><p class="calibre8">Staring into the
common room fire nearly a month later Harry realised he'd forgotten
all about it again. He needed to ask Madam Pomfrey about it. He
wondered idly if it had anything to do with the wooden panels in the
room. In his experience, even seemingly random objects and ideas were
connected somehow. He started thinking about the wooden panels. There
was something there, but what?</p><p class="calibre8">"I need to pin
Neville down and we need to go figure out that wooden panel," he
said suddenly. Hermione didn't answer him. She was staring into the
fire. "Hermione?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I miss him,"
Hermione said tearfully. Harry sighed and slid his arms around her
and held her. He knew who she meant.</p><p class="calibre8">"Me too," he
whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">And that was how
Brogan McLaggen found them a few minutes later as the Gryffindors
came trickling in to get ready for tea.</p><p class="calibre8">"This what you get
up to when Weasley's not here?" he sneered, situating himself
just behind their heads. Harry jumped. Brogan continued. "Well I
wouldn't mind a crack at her myself, so … thanks." He
straightened up and swaggered in the direction of the boys'
dormitories.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you touch
her," Harry growled. Harry could feel the other Gryffindors in the
room freeze and out of the corner of his eye he dimly noticed Seamus
and Neville move towards them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really, you'd
think a little toerag like you would have learned your lesson,"
Seamus said. A crowd of students gathered to watch, shifting
restlessly as more students trickled in through the portrait hole.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione stood on
the hearthrug, flustered. Harry glanced at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't you touch
me," Brogan screeched. "I won't stand for this again!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What are you
going to do?" Seamus smirked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well maybe I'll
start by telling Weasley exactly what I saw," Brogan said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Which is?"
Harry raised an eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are always
hanging out with her," Brogan said. "Spent more time with her
than Weasley lately and now I come in and find you two smooching."</p><p class="calibre8">"We weren't
smooching!" Harry exclaimed incredulously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Looked like it to
me," Brogan said smugly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … you …"
Harry trailed off, at a loss for words.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry and
Hermione have been friends for years," Neville said quietly. "And
if you don't want points taken again I suggest you stop spreading
nasty, vicious, little rumours."</p><p class="calibre8">"They were
hugging!" Brogan claimed loudly. "Everyone saw that!" He
smirked at Harry triumphantly. Harry glared at him in return.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, for goodness
sake, it wasn't the first time," Hermione huffed mutinously.
"Anyone would think it's suddenly against the law to hug a
friend." She stomped her way to the portrait hole, the crowd of
students parted like a wave to let her out and as he turned to watch
her go, Harry saw the flash of Ginny's long, red ponytail as she
disappeared up the girls' dormitory stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">The castle seemed to
be buzzing when Harry went down to eat. Hermione had not come back to
the common room and Ginny had not come down from her dormitory.
Neville had eventually dragged Harry down to the Great Hall to eat
and he could feel more than one set of eyes on him as they made their
way to the Gryffindor table. Hermione was there, her head buried in a
massive, dusty book as she absently speared food from a plate near
her elbow.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey, Hermione,"
Neville said quietly as he sat down opposite her. He glanced
meaningfully at Harry who sighed and sank down into the seat next to
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi Neville …
Harry," Hermione said, looking up briefly from her book before
burying herself within its pages once more. The whispers in the Great
Hall seemed to seep into Harry's head, twisting and turning and
making him feel off-kilter, as if he was missing something.</p><p class="calibre8">"You know what?"
Seamus said suddenly, reaching for a leg of chicken, "If Ron were
here he'd stand up and tell everyone to shut it."</p><p class="calibre8">"And then he'd
get detention for three days," Dean added from his seat next to
Seamus, "for causing a ruckus."</p><p class="calibre8">"Because he would
have gone to beat up Malfoy when he made a sarcastic comment,"
Neville added, pushing a plate of roast beef under Harry's nose.
Seamus and Dean snorted and Harry managed a small smile as he speared
a piece of meat with his fork.</p><p class="calibre8">"If Ron was <em class="calibre9">here</em>
we wouldn't have this issue," Hermione interjected flatly, her
nose still in her book.</p><p class="calibre8">"We'd still have
the issue of a foul, loathsome, evil, little cockroach like Brogan,"
Harry said quietly. "How did we never notice him before?"</p><p class="calibre8">"He grew up over
the last year," a slight, dark haired girl with a slight Irish lilt
volunteered from Harry's left. She blushed as they all turned to
look at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?" asked
Seamus incredulously. "He seems like a right foul git!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I don't
mean emotionally," the girl exclaimed, giggling. "He's very
stunted emotionally, but he used to be um, sort of skinny and weedy
and now he's sort of big and … tough. He grew." Hermione was
staring at the girl over the top of her book.</p><p class="calibre8">"He likes to throw
this new found weight around?" Harry asked her. The girl nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"He thinks now
that Cormac's gone to work in Russia he's the kingpin," she
replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"The what?"
Seamus raised his eyebrow.</p><p class="calibre8">"What makes him
think Cormac was ever some sort of … leader?" Hermione scoffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, not here,"
the girl said. "In the family. And Cormac always made it sound like
he was more influential than he really was at school."</p><p class="calibre8">"The family?"
Neville asked. The girl was being annoyingly succinct as she poured
gravy over her meat and began to eat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, he's me
cousin," she said through a mouthful of potatoes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who, Cormac?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah, Brogan,"
she rolled her eyes. "Cormac's me brother."</p><p class="calibre8">"So basically
Brogan thinks he's the best thing on two legs and that the world
owes him?" Harry asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Worse than
Cormac, he is." She nodded her head emphatically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll say,"
Hermione muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">By some unspoken
agreement Neville, Hermione and Harry stayed in the Great Hall until
the meal was cleared entirely away. They all knew that they were
waiting for Ginny. She never came. When they were the last people in
the room Neville got to his feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on," he
said softly. "I've got some Transfiguration homework I could use
some help with." Hermione looked up at him and sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"She heard the
whole thing, didn't she?" she asked them. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think so," he
said miserably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe she'll be
ready to talk now," Neville said as the three of them shuffled out
of the Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know if
I am. What am I supposed to say?" Harry asked as they came to the
portrait behind which the secret Gryffindor Room lay.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it'll
be more about what you do," Hermione muttered. Neville hesitated
slightly in front of the portrait.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey, you want to
go see if we can figure this thing out?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," muttered
Harry, pushing the portrait aside and started up the narrow
staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">"You really should
go talk to Ginny," Hermione said, frowning. Harry ignored her,
something unpleasant coiling in his stomach. He knew he needed to
talk to Ginny, but it didn't make it any easier to confront the
situation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's go," he
said to Neville. "Coming Hermione?" She looked at them and
sighed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fine."</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">The common room was
still full when Harry, Hermione and Neville finally returned. Groups
of students were clustered around tables strewn with parchment and
books, board games or magazines. Brogan McLaggen, who gave Harry a
superior look as he crossed the room, was holding court in front of
the fireplace with a group of fourth years. Harry rolled his eyes at
the younger boy, searching for Ginny. He found her tucked into a
chair in one corner, her Charms textbook in her hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry we didn't
get very far," Neville was saying as Harry stared at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Those runes are
hard," Hermione commented, rummaging in her bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you sure
there are more there than there was last time?" Neville asked.
Harry didn't hear Hermione's reply as he crossed to where Ginny
was sitting. He approached carefully. She looked guarded and held the
book in front of her as if it were a shield, protecting her from the
rest of the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey Ginny,"
Harry said quietly. He felt like people were staring at them and
glanced surreptitiously around but everyone seemed to be absorbed in
what they were doing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hi Harry,"
Ginny replied. She did not look up. Harry stood uncomfortably while
she pretended to read her book, turning pages deliberately before she
had time to absorb any of the information contained on the pages.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought you'd
have come down to eat," Harry eventually said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wasn't hungry,"
Ginny replied, turning another page rapidly.</p><p class="calibre8">"You haven't
eaten?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't have an
appetite," Ginny said shortly. Harry took a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"Listen, I don't
know what it was exactly that you heard earlier-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably the same
thing as everyone else," Ginny cut him off, snapping her book shut
and standing up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well he-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's fine,
Harry," Ginny interrupted again. "Don't worry about it. You
deserve to be happy. I'm not going to stand in the way of that."</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't stand
in the way of it," Harry replied with exasperation. "What are you
trying to say?"</p><p class="calibre8">"There's no need
to pretend," Ginny said tiredly, turning away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pretend what?"</p><p class="calibre8">"That you're
still interested."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, don't be so
ridiculous," Harry hissed, desperately hoping no one could hear
their discussion.</p><p class="calibre8">"There is <em class="calibre9">no
need</em> to start calling me names," Ginny replied coldly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said softly, "but you can't believe what Brogan's going
around saying, surely?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no! I don't
believe<em class="calibre9"> that</em> idiot!" Ginny laughed harshly. "I know
neither you nor Hermione would do that to Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">"But you believe I
would do it to <em class="calibre9">you</em>?" Harry asked quietly. Ginny just looked
at him sadly for a moment before she turned away and headed up the
dormitory stairs. Harry stared after her, dumbfounded, not really
understanding what had just happened but feeling reasonably sure
Ginny was slowly slipping away from him and he was powerless to stop
it.</p><p class="calibre8">The next few days
until the weekend dragged. Ginny avoided Harry with a dogged
determination that would have made Moody proud. Harry always found
himself sitting two or three seats away from her at meals, during
classes and in the common room. Hermione tried to talk to her but
Ginny made excuses and started avoiding her as well. Neville managed
to hold one cryptic conversation with her where she'd insisted that
things were 'better this way'.</p><p class="calibre8">"She looks
terrible," Neville had murmured later. "I don't know what
things exactly are better, but it's not better for her health."
Harry watched helplessly as she began to look pale and drawn. She
walked with her head down, stopped responding in class and went up to
bed early. It wasn't easy to watch her. Ginny vacated rooms as soon
as she could after Harry entered and seemed determined to practice
Quidditch during every spare waking moment.</p><p class="calibre8">One afternoon when
it was raining so hard the Gryffindor Quidditch team had refused to
practice for longer than half an hour, Ginny was sitting alone in
front of the common room fire, staring into space.</p><p class="calibre8">"How's Quidditch
training going?" Harry asked her, sitting tentatively on one of the
chairs nearby. Her cheeks were flushed and her freshly-washed hair
shone in the firelight. He ached to reach out and touch her but she
seemed to have an impenetrable wall around her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pretty good,"
Ginny answered. "The Beaters are getting better. And Kyle's still
doing really well. The trainee Seekers are coming along too."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sounds like you
don't need me," Harry said lightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wouldn't say
that," Ginny said, a flash of warmth flooding her features for a
moment. Harry smiled, encouraged by her willingness to talk to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you … um,
think the Harpies will let you know about try-outs soon?" Harry
asked her, wanting to prolong the moment, casting about for something
to talk about.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think they'll
be sending letters out after Christmas."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think it's
great you are putting in all this extra work," Harry said. She eyed
him warily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh yeah," Harry
replied enthusiastically. "It's a fantastic opportunity and
really, what could be better than making a secure future for
yourself?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I suppose
so," Ginny said. The warmth had left her features and she had
resumed staring into the fire.</p><p class="calibre8">"Absolutely,"
Harry enthused. "It's such a brilliant opportunity. You should
really make the most of it." He knew he was babbling and Ginny
hadn't left him quite so incoherent for a long time but he
desperately wanted to prolong the conversation.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, well, don't
worry," Ginny snapped inexplicably. "I'm doing the best I can."
She stood up abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay, you
don't have to pretend-"</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">Why</em> do you
keep saying that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Never mind,"
Ginny said and she left swiftly. Harry stared after her, willing her
to come back, confess it was all a big mistake and throw herself into
his arms. The portrait hole remained stubbornly closed.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry left Hogwarts
as soon as he could that Friday. He surprised Andromeda, who had not
been expecting him so early. He was too tired and miserable to
explain anything to her and Andromeda did not press the issue,
wordlessly handing Teddy over and retreating tactfully.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry wasn't sure
if Molly Weasley had planned to visit that afternoon or if Andromeda
had contacted her. He came in from a walk with Teddy to find her in
the kitchen with a cup of tea and some of Andromeda's finest
fruitcake.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah, there you
are, Harry," Molly said, reaching into the pram where Teddy sat
propped up and wrapped in layers of blankets. She pulled off his
little, knitted hat and ruffled Teddy's black, tufty hair, smiling
at him. Teddy grinned a gummy smile, showing his two even white teeth
as he squealed at Molly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Da!" Teddy
cried. "Da, da, ba!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, you are a
very clever lad," Molly smiled at the baby and Teddy turned his
hair red and his eyes flickered for a moment before settling into a
deep brown. "Oh look Andie, he's done his eyes like mine again."</p><p class="calibre8">"He tried to make
his ears like Kreacher the other day," Andromeda said, chuckling.
Teddy waved his little fists, flapping them in agitation. Harry
reached over and carefully untied his little mittens before
extracting him from his blankets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cake, Harry?"
Molly asked gently. Harry shook his head carefully, concentrating on
removing the heavy woollen jumper Teddy was wearing. He tried not to
look at the baby's eyes, so much like Ginny's, but Teddy began
bouncing excitedly and turned his little face up to Harry, squealing
with delight. He grabbed at Harry's glasses and Harry let him grasp
them, pulling them off his face before he carefully removed them from
the tiny fingers and lay them on the table out of reach.</p><p class="calibre8">Without his glasses
he didn't have to look at Ginny's eyes in that adorable face and
see the red Weasley hair now adorning Teddy's head. The baby lunged
for Harry's ears as if they were a fascinating play thing and Harry
grimaced as a wet, slobbery kiss was planted on his cheek. Without
his glasses Harry also did not have to look at the concern etched on
the faces of both women at the kitchen table. He breathed a sigh of
relief when Teddy changed his eyes back to green after trying
unsuccessfully to eat Harry's nose.</p><p class="calibre8">"Da!" Teddy
squealed. He seemed to realise he hadn't gotten much of a response
from Harry and his little forehead wrinkled as he stuck a finger in
his mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"You didn't have
much lunch, Harry," Andromeda said quietly. "Are you sure you
wouldn't like some cake?" Harry shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine," he
replied softly. Even without his glasses on he couldn't miss the
look Molly and Andromeda shared. He could ignore it though. He stood
up, plucking his glasses from the table and shoving them on his face
hastily. "I'll just go change him and put him down for his nap."
Harry didn't wait for an answer; he turned and hurried up the
stairs to Teddy's small nursery.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ha," Teddy said
solemnly, as Harry laid him down on the change table, charming a
stuffed Golden Snitch to fly above Teddy's head. As he changed the
baby into sleepwear, Harry spoke softly to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry, buddy,"
Harry said quietly. "I guess I'm not in a very talkative mood
today, am I?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ma," Teddy
said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
Ginny likes me anymore," Harry said, pulling off the soft little
shoes that held Teddy's socks on. Teddy kicked his feet in the air
excitedly, clutching at his toes and pulling his socks off with ease.</p><p class="calibre8">"La!" he
squealed, waving the socks.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm in love
with her," Harry said as he carefully buttoned Teddy's sleepsuit.
"Ginny … she's so beautiful, Teddy. I thought … I thought she
loved me too." He picked Teddy up and settled into the rocking
chair by the window, settling the baby on his lap.</p><p class="calibre8">"Aaaaah," Teddy
replied, twisting in Harry's lap until he could rest his head on
Harry's chest, his little legs tucked up under his body.</p><p class="calibre8">"We shared
something really special," Harry whispered. "I don't know what
went wrong. I wish my dad was here, he'd be able to help me figure
it out; or my mum. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry you haven't got a
mum and dad, either." Teddy raised his head and looked at Harry
carefully before stretching up a little hand and clutching at Harry's
collar.</p><p class="calibre8">"Har," he said
sleepily. Harry let the tears fall onto the downy head as the baby
fell into a deep slumber.</p><p class="calibre8">When Harry came down
the stairs some time later he saw Molly in the entrance hall, her
travelling cloak around her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"There you are,
dear," Molly said briskly. "I wondered where you'd gotten to."
Harry narrowed his eyes. She seemed to be falsely cheerful.</p><p class="calibre8">"Took a while,"
he offered by way of explanation. Molly smiled and plucked his cloak
from the stand in the hallway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's be off
then," she said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where are we
going?" Harry asked in confusion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Home," Molly
said simply, in a tone that brooked no argument. Harry sighed heavily
and wrapped his cloak around his shoulders before popping his head
into the kitchen to bid Andromeda farewell.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry and Molly
arrived at the Burrow and she set him to work preparing vegetables
immediately, keeping up a steady stream of conversation that Harry
barely listened to. He nodded in what he thought were all the right
places and scrubbed, peeled and chopped until a meal was bubbling
merrily on the stove.</p><p class="calibre8">George didn't come
home that night, sending word to say he was meeting with Percy at The
Leaky Cauldron. So Harry spent the meal listening to Ginny's
parents discuss the rising cost of fresh fruit and vegetables and
their suspicion that the ghoul might be lonely. He excused himself as
soon as possible after he'd eaten half a piece of treacle tart.
Harry hovered on the landing outside Ginny's bedroom before opening
the door quietly and slipping inside. Her scent lingered on the air.
He closed his eyes and imagined her there, laughing and smiling at
him, kissing him.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's mind
drifted back to Hallowe'en. He and Ginny hadn't lingered in the
large room lined with paintings. Ginny had led the way slowly and
surely to the little door at the other end and Harry had looked at
her as if asking permission before he placed his hand slowly on the
doorknob. They waited as it grew in size until it was big enough to
let them through.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you think
this room was?" Ginny asked, running a hand over the handle of the
dagger that matched the sword of Gryffindor as Harry lit one of the
torches.</p><p class="calibre8">"Looks like maybe
a duelling room," Harry shrugged, padding over to the fireplace and
inspecting it. "I think this wood will still be good …" He
froze as he felt two soft, warm hands slide around his waist from
behind.</p><p class="calibre8">"A fire probably
isn't the most important thing," Ginny had whispered. Harry
turned in her grasp and slid his arms around her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably not,"
he whispered back.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry roused himself
from his memories and slipped back out onto the landing. He padded
quietly up to Ron's bedroom, memories of Ginny kissing his jaw line
and down his chest dancing across his mind as he undressed for bed.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was sitting on
Ron's bed, the jar of Madam Pomfrey's ointment in his hands when
Molly suddenly opened the door and stepped through. She started when
she looked up to see Harry sitting there, shirtless.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry dear,
I'm not used to anyone being in here at the moment," she said
ruefully. "I guess I forgot."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's okay,"
Harry said quietly, bending his head over the jar to unscrew the lid
with more precision than such an action warranted. He still managed
to fumble and dropped the jar. It rolled to Molly's feet. She bent
down to scoop it up and stepped over to give it to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"To heal and fade
the scarring?" she asked softly. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not having
a lot of luck with applying it, though," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why didn't you
get Ginny to do this for you?" Molly asked as she examined his
bared shoulder, the raised, angry welts trailed down his upper arm
and wound up his neck stood out in sharp relief in the mirror above
Ron's dresser. Harry sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … well, I
didn't want her to see them," Harry admitted.</p><p class="calibre8">"We had an Owl
from her this week," Molly said conversationally, holding out her
hand for the jar. Harry looked up apprehensively. He gave her the jar
and turned his head away, looking out of the window at the stars that
twinkled in the clear sky. Molly unscrewed the jar and continued.
"She seemed a little off."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think we sort
of had a fight," Harry said. He flinched as he felt Molly's
fingers smear the ointment on his upper arm and towards his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"What was it
about?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione … Ron
… Quidditch …<em class="calibre9"> us</em> … I don't even know anymore," Harry
blurted out. He felt Molly's hand stop briefly before she resumed
applying the ointment to the parts of his shoulder he had been unable
to reach. Harry blushed profusely.</p><p class="calibre8">"She said she's
been playing a lot of Quidditch and Hermione has been on at her to
study more," Molly volunteered.</p><p class="calibre8">"She took over
captaining the team, I suppose," Harry said, seizing on the most
innocuous aspect of the can of worms he'd opened up. "I'm not
allowed to fly."</p><p class="calibre8">"I should think
not," Molly sniffed, spreading ointment around the back of Harry's
neck and massaging gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"We aren't
spending much time together," Harry started, feeling something
inside him give way, spilling his feelings out into the room. "She's
practicing so hard for her chance with the Harpies and studying for
her NEWTS. I've had a lot of paperwork to go through for the
Children's Home, there's Teddy and … well Hermione doesn't
let me slack off either. I miss her even though we're always
together. But, well … Ginny … she heard this fourth year idiot
spouting off rot about me and Hermione. She … she thinks it's
true – if not with Hermione with … someone."</p><p class="calibre8">"What happened
with Hermione?" Molly asked quietly. Harry looked up at her
sharply.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's not-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Molly
cut him off, looking him in the eye. There was no accusation in her
gaze and her touch remained soft as she continued with the ointment.
"What happened that makes her think it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know,"
Harry sighed. "How could she think that? She's my everything. I
share everything with her." Harry hung his head in despair.</p><p class="calibre8">"She hasn't seen
these scars."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well …" Harry
swallowed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've seen you
together, Harry," Molly said, working the ointment down his arm
even though he knew she could reach those areas himself. "You're
young and in love. I remember what that's like, Arthur and I were
like that once." Molly chuckled as she scooped more ointment from
the jar and began working over Harry's shoulder again, as if she
might have missed a spot. "Well, let's just say she doesn't
keep her hands to herself and you don't stop her." Harry blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's very …
persuasive," Harry acknowledged reluctantly. Molly laughed softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She always has
been and she almost never gets turned down," she said. "How did
you hide the scars from her?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it was
easy. They are mostly under my clothes-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," Molly
said warningly, "I wasn't born yesterday." Harry wondered how
much she knew, or how much she'd figured out about his relationship
with her daughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't let
her touch them," he said eventually. "Not even through clothes.
You can feel them …"</p><p class="calibre8">"So you pushed her
away. Pulled away from her; and now she seems to think you are seeing
someone else?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, when you
put it like that it sounds terrible," Harry grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't think
she thinks you <em class="calibre9">are</em> seeing someone," Molly said gently. "If
I know Ginny, it's more that she thinks you would … enjoy the
company of … someone different, rather than her."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't have
to go into detail, dear," Molly said, still massaging his shoulder
almost absently. She took a deep breath and sighed as if she might
be thinking about what to say next. "But you've … been together
I'm sure." Harry was mortified and had no idea what to say. He
understood exactly what Molly was implying.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … we … she
…"</p><p class="calibre8">"Which is
absolutely none of my business. You're both of age; both
fully-grown," Molly said firmly, slathering more ointment across
places she had already anointed. "She was bound to feel very
vulnerable afterwards. It's a very … exposing experience."</p><p class="calibre8">"We haven't …
I got bitten right after," Harry eventually blurted.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah," Molly
said. She seemed to be waiting for Harry to say something.</p><p class="calibre8">"I couldn't let
her see them," he said softly, still feeling the heat of
embarrassment warming his cheeks.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny wouldn't
think less of you because of a few scars, Harry," Molly said,
frowning.</p><p class="calibre8">"No!" Harry
exclaimed. "It's not that. I'm dangerous and I'm reckless and
… I do things without thinking them through and …" He trailed
off. Molly regarded him for a moment before speaking.</p><p class="calibre8">"And these scars
are as bad as they are because you got them flying Seeker for her,"
she said eventually, matter-of-factly. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I just didn't
want her to know," Harry said softly. "I didn't want her to
blame herself. I guess … the whole thing is my fault. I kept
pulling away from her and now I'm complaining because I miss her.
What did I expect? She's probably thinking … Oh, who am I
kidding? I don't know what she's thinking."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, I expect by
now she's thinking you prefer girls more like Hermione," Molly
said softly, sitting down next to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like …
smarter?" puzzled Harry. Molly chuckled softly as she screwed the
lid back on the jar and handed Harry his pyjama top.</p><p class="calibre8">"No," Molly said
quietly. "Not smarter, curvier." Harry drew his brows together in
concentration.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione's got
more curves?" he asked in confusion. "Really?" Molly smiled
widely and patted his cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, dear. Yes,
she does," was all she said as she stood and headed for the door.
"Get a good night's sleep. You need to go back to Hogwarts in the
morning and sort this out." Harry nodded numbly, his mind turning
over, running through the meaning of Molly's previous words.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny thinks I'm
not happy with her?" he asked as Molly stood on the threshold. She
turned slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"If you've
stopped being affectionate she might think you're … not attracted
to her," Molly said.</p><p class="calibre8">"She thinks I
don't want her anymore? After …" Harry gestured aimlessly with
one hand and turned bright red. "Doesn't she?" He looked
beseechingly at Molly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I suspect so,
dear." She nodded slightly. Harry jumped up, grabbing his cloak and
throwing it on.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I can't
stay, then," he said urgently. "I have to go now and talk to
her."</p><p class="calibre8">"You may want to
change out of your pyjamas, dear," Molly said with a hint of a
smile. Harry smiled sheepishly and rummaged in his bag for the shirt
he'd been wearing earlier. He stopped suddenly and turned to Molly.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did you
know?" he asked quietly. "Are you … upset?" Molly looked at
Harry thoughtfully for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought I would
be," she said after a moment. "It's not easy reminding yourself
that your baby's grown up. I think a year ago I would have been
very upset. So much has happened since then and … I had a talk with
Ginny over the summer and she told me how much you mean to her."
Molly stepped back into the room and sat down on the bed. She patted
the counterpane next to her.</p><p class="calibre8">"She means
everything to me," Harry said softly, sitting down next to Molly
and twisting his shirt in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"I know," Molly
said, smoothing his hair back from his forehead. "It's not up to
me to decide when or where or who with. Ginny knew you were the one
for her, probably long before we all believed her."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you believe
her?" Harry asked, surprised at his own boldness. He quickly looked
down at his knees.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes," Molly
said, "and I believe you too." Harry felt a lump rise in his
throat. He swallowed painfully. He hadn't realised just how much he
wanted someone to tell him that. Molly shifted slightly and reached
out a hand to his chin. She turned his face so that he was looking at
her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Does she still?"
he whispered. "Does she still know I'm hers?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sure she
does," Molly said. "She just needs reminding." Molly let go of
Harry's chin but he held her gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"What for?"
Molly looked surprised.</p><p class="calibre8">"I … she's
your daughter and …" Harry shifted uncomfortably not knowing how
to justify to Molly that he had slept with her only daughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't apologise
for loving her, Harry," Molly said. "If there is one thing having
you in our lives has taught us, it's that there is no such thing as
too much love." She reached over and engulfed Harry in a hug. Harry
found himself hugging her back.</p><p class="calibre8">"I always thought
you taught me that," he mumbled into her shoulder. Molly pulled
back a little.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," she
said, holding onto his upper arms and searching his face, "Ginny
made her choices a long time ago. I'm not going to try and convince
you, or myself, that a year ago I wouldn't have been upset but …
things are probably different now. I lost one of my babies."</p><p class="calibre8">"I know, I'm so
sorry-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm not going
to get angry or upset with you for loving each other," Molly
interrupted quietly. "There have been too many losses." Harry
studied her face carefully. She smiled at him and squeezed his
scarred shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've been
really stupid," Harry said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Maybe," Molly
allowed, smiling slightly. She stood up and crossed swiftly to the
door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,"
Harry whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Any time, Harry,"
she said and slipped quietly out the door and down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry hastily donned
his clothes, shoved his things in his bag and leapt down the stairs
two at a time. Arthur was still sitting at the kitchen table, <em class="calibre9">The
Evening Prophet</em> open in front of him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're off,
then?" Arthur enquired as Harry stopped to snatch his half eaten
treacle tart from his plate. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, got someone I
need to talk to," he muttered, stuffing the tart into his mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"If she lets you
get a word in," Arthur murmured, turning the page of his newspaper.
Harry stared at him and swallowed the last of the treacle tart
reflexively.</p><p class="calibre8">"She isn't
talking to me," he eventually said dryly. "I figure if I'm
quick I might get out a couple sentences before she fires up."
Arthur looked up at Harry, his eyes twinkling as he laughed. Harry
shrugged sheepishly. Arthur regarded him for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good luck, son,"
Arthur said eventually. Harry smiled grimly. He had a feeling he was
going to need it.</p>
