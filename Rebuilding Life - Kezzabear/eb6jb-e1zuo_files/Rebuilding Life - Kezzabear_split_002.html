<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_3">*Chapter 2*: Chapter 2</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Mourning Remus</strong></p><p class="calibre8">"They won't
really hurt you, you know." Mr Weasley smiled as they walked
companionably towards the Entrance Hall. "Besides, if they try it
Molly will have their heads. They'll figure that out as soon as
they realise." Harry was startled and stopped to stare at the other
man.</p><p class="calibre8">"Our daughter
may not tell her brothers everything, but she usually tells her
mother," Mr Weasley said and gave a wry chuckle. "Molly, of
course, tells me everything." He smiled and motioned Harry to
continue walking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron was filthy
at me," said Harry. "Not for going out with her, he was okay with
that part. Mind you, Hermione and I had to duck a few heated
conversations between him and Ginny about displays of affection. You
heard about Lavender I suspect?" Mr Weasley nodded a smile still on
his face and motioned for Harry to continue.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron was filthy
at me when I, er … when I, well …"</p><p class="calibre8">"When you
ditched her?" asked Mr Weasley bluntly. Harry cringed. Mr Weasley
reached over and patted him on the shoulder. "No one could fault
you there, Harry. Not even Ginny if she's honest with herself."</p><p class="calibre8">They continued
the rest of the way in silence. Harry started to enter the Great
Hall. Ron and his brothers were sitting with Hermione at the end of
the Gryffindor table listening to Neville intently. Some of the
teachers sat at the head table and groups of students were scattered
randomly about the house tables chatting and eating what appeared to
be lunch. He couldn't see Mrs Weasley or Ginny. He briefly wondered
where they were before Mr Weasley tapped
him on the shoulder and motioned him to a small room a short distance
away. As they got closer Harry could hear muffled sobs coming from
the room. He sighed, just his luck that his visitor appeared to be a
crying female.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mr Weasley,
I'm not at all good with crying women!" he protested. "I don't
know what to do with them at all. That's why Ginny – well, er,
who is it and why does she want to see me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh no, Harry,
that's not your visitor," exclaimed Mr Weasley. "I am sure
she'll want to see you when she composes herself though. I'll
just nip in and get your visitor shall I?" Harry could only nod as
he stood nervously in the Entrance Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">It wasn't long
before Mr Weasley emerged from the room, this time carrying a bundle
in his arms. It wriggled and had a tuft of turquoise hair. Harry took
a few steps back and Mr Weasley laughed softly at the look of terror
on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay
Harry, he's not crying." Harry heard footsteps behind him and
turned to see Neville exit the Great Hall just as Mr Weasley reached
him he stopped only long enough to make sure Harry wasn't going to
drop the bundle before whispering that Molly needed him to help her
with their other guest.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry was left
standing in the Entrance Hall with a wriggling, squirming bundle. It
was a baby. His godson, Teddy, and Harry had no idea what to do with
him. Too scared to look at the baby, Harry instead chose to stare
fixedly at the crooked hat on a portrait of a witch who had clearly
been drinking with Violet and The Fat Lady.</p><p class="calibre8">"Crikey Harry!
I didn't think that was the reason Ginny didn't come back to
school! Her brothers are going to kill you," Neville's voice
seemed abnormally loud as it broke the stillness. Harry started and
swung around to face Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" he
croaked, "This isn't my baby, or Ginny's baby or – What on
earth makes you think that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well Mr
Weasley came and handed you that baby," Neville shrugged. "Ginny
never came back to school after Easter, so…"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well he's
not ours!" said Harry exasperatedly. "He doesn't look like us!
We haven't, we didn't!" He spluttered to a stop, staring at
Neville in horror.</p><p class="calibre8">"You think I'd
take advantage of her like that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"No Harry I
don't think that but er, well maybe you can teach him to stop
changing colours like that?" Harry looked down at Teddy for the
first time and saw a pair of bright green eyes that mirrored his own
looking back at him curiously. The baby's hair had turned a lovely
shade of Weasley red. Little Teddy Lupin currently looked exactly
like a cross between him and Ginny to the casual observer. But Harry
was not a casual observer and as he looked at Teddy he saw Tonks
gazing out at him from Remus's face, little fat fists waving about
as he stared fascinated at Harry's glasses. Harry looked up at
Neville and swallowed heavily, blinking back the tears he could feel
were coming.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm his
godfather," he whispered. "This is Professor Lupin's son.
Voldemort … Death Eaters have taken his parents. All he's got is
his godfather, me and – and his grandmother." He didn't think
he could hold back the tears much longer as the enormity of it all
hit him with force and he turned away from Neville and looked back
down at Teddy who was still gazing at him serenely.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's got me
too," whispered Neville, "he's got me too." Neville sounded
on the brink of tears himself and Harry chanced a look at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"He'll need
us, Harry." Harry nodded. He knew that was true and he knew that
Teddy wasn't going to suffer the same way that he and Neville had.
He knew that as the last of his father's friends and his godfather
Harry could give to Teddy the things he never had. He knew that
Neville would understand and Harry smiled tearfully at Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, he's
got us, hasn't he?" Together the three of them slowly walked
towards the Entrance Doors, pushed them open and stood in the
sunlight, watching the first Voldemort free day. Teddy's little
fist finally made contact with its goal and he knocked Harry's
glasses askew, grinning up at Harry with a toothless gummy smile and
Harry felt his resolve crumble. This smiley little infant had no idea
what he'd lost, no idea what sacrifice had been made for him, no
idea the enormity of what had just happened and no idea that Harry
had lost the last link to his parents. But at that moment the
enormity of it hit Harry hard and he sank to the stone steps and
tears began to drip down his cheeks as he began to shake with huge
wracking sobs. He clutched tighter to Teddy and sobbed into his
blankets as the infant began to bat his fists jerkily around Harry's
head, tangling fat fingers in his hair.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry didn't
notice Neville dash back into the Great Hall or hear the stampede of
people rushing out again. It was only when he heard a slight
commotion and felt a soft hand touch his shoulder that he raised his
head to see Mrs Weasley looking tearfully at him. The door to the
Entrance Hall behind her was blocked by five imposing red heads and
Neville while the inhabitants of Hogwarts argued with Bill Weasley
who insisted that no one was going near Harry except his family, it
had, after all, been a long week.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," Mrs
Weasley said softly, "let me take Teddy. Andromeda will look after
him. We can have a talk." Harry stared at her unseeing. He did not
relinquish his grip on Teddy and tears continued to drip down his
face. Teddy began to squirm and whimper softly as Mr Weasley and Mrs
Tonks made their way past Charlie. Harry turned to look out across
the grounds as tears continued to fall silently onto Teddy's
blankets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, come
on, let's get you inside."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," and
a hand touched his hair, smoothing it from his face. "Come on
Harry. Let's have something to eat." He did not answer them and
he did not let Teddy go. He ignored the frantic whispering behind him
and looked down at the baby in his arms who stopped wriggling and
gazed at him solemnly. The enormity of what had happened and what was
still to be done weighed heavily on his mind. He stared as Teddy's
hair changed to black and his eyes went brown but he didn't really
see. What was he going to do now?</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry," said
Mr Weasley softly. "Come inside." Harry continued to look at
Teddy as the baby blew bubbles with his mouth, his tiny hands
reaching again for Harry's glasses. The frantic whispering behind
him grew louder and a commotion began to erupt</p><p class="calibre8">"Let me take
him, Harry," a soft warm voice whispered and he felt a small, warm
hand cover his own. Without really thinking about it he let the small
hands take the baby and then he let them encircle him in a hug as the
owner of those small warm hands stroked his hair and her voice
whispered words of comfort in his ear while he cried on her shoulder,
enveloped in her flowery scent.</p>
