			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Skies
Are Blue</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Sunday
in Origin Alley dawned bright, clear and cloudless. Harry lay
peacefully in bed, slowly surfacing from a deep and satisfying
slumber when Ron and George began to obnoxiously fight over using the
ensuite. Ron was anxious to get away with Hermione for the day and
George was going out with Jonathon – the possibility of picking up
some 'sheila birds' was not out of the question. As he reached
for his glasses Harry idly wondered what George had going with Katie
if he was so willing to pick up casual women but mentally shrugged
because it was none of his business. The argument was averted when
Hermione and Ginny came into the room and Hermione declared their
ensuite free and George raced in to use it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
leave a mess in the sink!" yelled Ginny. She turned to Harry a
dazzling smile on her face. "What are we going to do today?"
Looking at Ron and Hermione, Harry shrugged. Hermione averted her
gaze and looked pointedly at Ron who failed to immediately grab the
shower now that it was no longer under dispute and sat back down to
eat the remains of his breakfast at leisure. Harry wondered why he
hadn't just let George go first while he ate. Ron swallowed the
last bite of his crumpet and shrugged apologetically at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"We've
got plans," he said simply before turned a delicate shade of pink.
"And, er … well, they don't involve you." Harry stifled a
chuckle while Hermione groaned.</p><p class="calibre8">"Could
you have been any ruder, Ron?" she hissed. Ron scraped the chair on
the floor as he got up from the tiny table on which the most enormous
breakfast tray Harry had ever seen was balanced precariously.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
not offended, Hermione," said Ron over his shoulder as he headed
for the ensuite. "He's been trying to figure out a way to ditch
us and be alone with Ginny since he woke up!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Since
yesterday, actually," muttered Harry under his breath while Ginny
giggled and Hermione huffed, sitting down at the table and helping
herself to a glass of juice and a piece of toast that Ron had somehow
missed. Ginny stood awkwardly next to Hermione and Harry suddenly
sensed what it was she was awkward about. He propped himself up on
his elbows, heedless of his bedcovers pooling around his waist and
exposing his bare chest and quirked an eyebrow at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
I get a good morning snog today?" he asked boldly. Ginny blushed
heavily before flinging herself across the room and on top of him and
captured his lips in a kiss. Harry brought his arms around her and
they both fell back on the bed. They heard the rustle of Hermione
burying herself behind the <em class="calibre9">Sunday Oracle</em>
and continued kissing, Harry's hands respectably above Ginny's
waist while he trailed kisses down her jaw and down into the hollow
where her neck and shoulders began. He felt Ginny run her fingers
over his chest as she pulled away and bent down to press a kiss to
the oval shaped scar over his heart and his eyes slid shut only to
snap open seconds later when George slammed the door between the two
rooms on his way back from the girls' ensuite.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
that!" he grumbled as he threw his towel over a chair. "We don't
need to see that sort of thing so soon after breakfast. Bill and
Fleur need to remember that too and put up bloody locking charms as
well as silencing ones!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
if you will wander in on people who are on their honeymoon, George,"
said Hermione idly as she turned a page.</p><p class="calibre8">"No!
They need to keep their <em class="calibre9">activities</em>
to the bed instead of leaning against the door!" cried George
plaintively. "How was I supposed to know they weren't actually
knocking? I've been scarred for life!" His little tirade was cut
short as Hermione turned the next page and gasped. George hurried
over to see what had surprised her while Harry and Ginny both tried
to leap off the bed at the same time and came tumbling to the floor
in a tangle of bedclothes with a loud thump. The noise brought Ron
flying out of the ensuite clad only in a towel.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
the bloody hell-" Ron caught sight of Harry and Ginny tangled on
the floor and groaned. "Just keep it in until we've left, okay?"
Harry blushed and stood up hurriedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
weren't doing anything, Ron," he said as he moved behind Hermione
to read the paper over her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
not really your best side, mate," said George appraisingly as he
inspected the newspaper. "Still I don't expect you knew you were
posing for photographers when you were groping our baby sister like
that last night." Ron scrambled over his bag and a pair of
discarded shoes to peer at the paper over Harry's shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bloody
hell," he exclaimed. "Well at least they might lay off you and
Hermione now. Hey, wait a minute – Harry is your hand up her
jumper?" Harry snatched the paper out of Hermione's hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
you lot have somewhere to be today?" he asked pointedly, refolding
the paper and tucking it under one arm as he folded his arms across
his chest. He glared at Ron who muttered something about getting
dressed as he ducked back into the ensuite. George took a look in the
mirror and proclaimed himself devastatingly handsome before
sauntering to the door. He turned around and looked Harry up and
down.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do suggest you change into something else before you go out in public
today, my good man," he said, winking. "And do your hair or the
photos are going to turn out dreadfully." George left the room
whistling jauntily while Hermione shook her head exasperatedly.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
right though," she said. "There are bound to be photographers out
there today, just waiting to take your picture. Be careful, okay?"
And she swept out of the room returning seconds later with her
handbag and banging on the ensuite door she demanded that Ron hurry
up. They were gone moments later, Ron leaving behind a dire warning
about where Harry put his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sod
off, Ron," muttered Harry as he and Ginny found themselves alone.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
I see it?" asked Ginny softly into the silence. Wordlessly Harry
handed her the paper. He watched as she opened it and flicked through
the pages until she came to the photograph of them kissing in the
Quidditch box the night before. His photograph self ran his hands
down her back and, yes, up under the hem of her jumper. Harry sighed.
He hadn't even realised he'd done that last night. Ginny was
reading the article printed underneath.</p><p class="calibre7"><em class="calibre9">WEDDING OF THE CENTURY CALLED OFF</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Well,
that is what this publication assumes given the highly damning
evidence contained in this picture captured last night at the Warrior
– Nargun game out at Wollemi. It is evident, by the neat hair of
the maiden in this picture that this is not the woman with whom Harry
Potter, wizarding Britain's most eligible bachelor, was planning
his recent nuptials. Could he be eligible once again? Was the
rumoured wedding just that, a rumour? Who is the woman in the picture
and what relationship, if any, do they share?</em></p><p class="calibre8">The
article went on to list a few of the events associated with Harry's
life and an estimation of his net worth, surmising in the end that
the woman in the picture was simply a gold digger, whoever she was. A
low growl escaped Ginny's throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
am not a gold digger," she muttered. "And you are worth more than
three times as much as that!" Harry looked at her curiously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
am?" he asked in surprise. "Er, how do you know that?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
asked Bill and he got me the balance," she said absently, tucking a
piece of hair behind her ear as she turned the page.</p><p class="calibre8">"Huh,"
said Harry, staring at her. She must have felt his gaze on her for
she looked up.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
never thought to ask the balance before," was all he said as he
grabbed an apple from the breakfast tray and headed for the ensuite
to shower.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
okay, isn't it?" he heard her ask softly. Harry turned to smile
at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of
course it is," he assured her. "I'm going to shower, let's go
spend some of it." And he winked at her before sauntering through
the little door in the corner and into the ensuite.</p><p class="calibre8">**************************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
had never before spent a day doing <em class="calibre9">nothing</em>
and yet everything with Ginny, or indeed anyone. The first order of
the day had been to find some breakfast. Ginny had insisted that an
apple was not enough to sustain him and they had ventured into Tucker
Run to find several small cafes open and they shared a plate of
pancakes, washed down with strong coffee. At first Ginny had
protested the idea that they finish<em class="calibre9">
breakfast</em> with desert but Harry ordered
the chocolate mud cake she had been eyeing off anyway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,"
she reasoned as she picked up the fork, "it wouldn't do to <em class="calibre9">waste</em>
it." Harry grinned as he watched her stab the cake and maneuver a
dainty piece into her mouth. Her eyes slid shut as she pulled the
fork slowly from her mouth, sucking off the remnants of the fudge
icing. Harry gulped. His eyes were riveted as he watched her pop
another piece into her mouth and smile in appreciation of the
delicacy. He was sitting right next to her and suddenly felt that it
wasn't close enough. Ginny opened her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"This
is so good. Do you want some?" Ginny loaded the fork and aimed it
at Harry's mouth without waiting for an answer. He eyed the fork
warily for a moment but obediently opened his mouth. He was
unprepared for the sensual experience that was to be fed chocolate
cake by Ginny Weasley. As his lips closed around the smooth chocolate
treat he could see the sparkle in her eyes and the smile on her lips.
She pulled the fork slowly out of his mouth and, just as hers had
done, his eyes closed almost involuntarily, rendering all his other
senses acute. As the chocolate melted on his tongue he could feel the
heat where her knee pressed against his leg, her scent overwhelmed
him and he heard her breathe softly as the clink of the fork against
the plate revealed her intent to feed him more cake.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
opened his eyes and conjured another fork and spearing another bite
he raised it to her beautiful lips. The world was just the two of
them and a piece of chocolate cake. When the cake was gone and the
two forks discarded Harry leaned in and captured Ginny's lips in a
soft kiss that tasted of chocolate and love. They did not deepen the
kiss, it remained soft and sweet and chaste but as Harry entwined his
fingers with Ginny's the kiss touched deep inside his soul and he
felt drawn to her in a way he had not been before. They were barely
touching but there was something intimate in that kiss with only
their lips and hands touching, something that he had not experienced
before. As he pulled away slowly, his lips lingering feather light on
hers for just a moment he squeezed her hand with his to let her know
that he was still with her and he watched, entranced, as she opened
her eyes to look into his.</p><p class="calibre8">They
sat in silence for a moment, looking deep into each other's souls.
The moment was broken when a waiter dropped a pile of plates he had
been levitating into the kitchen and they hit the floor with a
resounding crash. Harry jumped and then smiled at Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let's
go exploring," he said to her. Ginny nodded, grinning. They settled
the account and then strolled out into the weak mid-morning sunshine.
Sunday morning had not slowed the bustle of Origin Alley and it was
as full of witches and wizards as it had been the day before. A stout
wizard in purple robes and a pointy hat was hawking his crystal balls
from a cart in the middle of the street while a thin, sticklike witch
who reminded Harry uncannily of Professor Trelawney was selling what
appeared to be odd tea cups and enormous bags of tea leaves. The two
divination peddlers were glaring at each other as they called out to
passersby to sample their wares. Ginny stopped to admire the rose
pattern on one of the teacups but Harry, eyeing the thin witch warily
tugged on her hand and gently urged her forward. He was vindicated in
his action when seconds later spellfire broke out between the thin
witch and the purple robed wizard, a sizzling red spell sailing
through the air where Ginny had been seconds before.</p><p class="calibre8">As
Harry instinctively wrapped one arm around Ginny and pulled out his
wand with the other hand, several shopkeepers spilled out into the
street and with practiced ease seemed to round up the combatants,
pack up their carts and deposit them each at different ends of the
Alley. The incident seemed to faze no one and the narrow, winding
Alley flared back to life within minutes. Harry put his wand away
slowly and looked around warily. He was acutely aware that Ginny was
trembling in his arms and pulled her close protectively.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you okay?" he asked her softly. She nodded slightly, still
trembling and Harry was not convinced. He attempted to reassure her
softly. "I'm pretty sure that was just an <em class="calibre9">Expelliarmus</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"Looked
more like <em class="calibre9">Stupefy</em>
to me," muttered Ginny. She straightened up and took a deep breath,
putting on a show of being very relaxed. "Oh, I'm fine, no
problem, no worries," she said, straightening her clothes and
taking a few steps. Harry rushed after her, putting a hand on her
arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you sure?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really,
Harry," she smiled a genuine smile, "I'm okay, just startled."
Harry let himself be convinced and dragged to the nearest shop window
to have a look.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
savoured the opportunity to peer into shop windows at his leisure,
relishing the feel of Ginny's hand safely ensconced in his own and
the wonders of a brand new community to explore. He let himself be
dragged from window to window while Ginny exclaimed over unfamiliar
sweets, exotic looking wands and a window with a display of
multicoloured quills. As he watched her almost press her nose against
the window of a tiny shop that appeared to sell dainty little
ornaments and adornments Harry realised that she was accustomed to
looking in windows only and was unlikely to actually enter any of
these shops of her own volition.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
look at that, Harry," said Ginny suddenly, pulling him from his
thoughts. "Isn't it beautiful? Hermione would adore that." She
was pointing to a tiny jeweled handbag that reminded Harry somewhat
of Hermione's beaded bag only this one was golden with red jewels.
It looked remarkably like something especially designed for
Gryffindors.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on then," said Harry as he pulled her into the tiny shop. The
inside of the store was crammed with more little bits and pieces than
Harry had thought were possible. Ginny wandered from shelf to shelf
exclaiming over sparkling hair accessories, glass ornaments and
strings of beads. Harry trailed after her, just watching her eyes
sparkle and her lips curve into a happy smile as she looked at
herself in a small jeweled mirror that told her she looked radiant.
He was content just to watch. He had absolutely no idea what half the
stuff in the little shop was for but figured witches knew what to do
with tiny statues made of wire and cloth and delicate little bowls
with filigree lids. There was one corner in which a small writing
table sat adorned with a lace doily and a tiny pink, fluffy cat
figurine that stretched and then curled up to sleep as he watched.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
like cats," said Ginny from behind him, "but that's just a
little too creepy." Harry could only agree and, desperate to erase
the pink cat from his memory, he turned and waved rather vaguely at
the window display with the little jeweled bag in it.</p><p class="calibre8">"D'you
think it would make a good birthday present for Hermione?" he asked
her. Ginny nodded absently as she examined set of tiny figurines near
the counter. They were of round, chubby babies with enormous eyes
that blinked at her when she reached out a finger to touch the little
hats on their heads. The ones with strategically placed leaves
appeared to be boys while others had on tiny fluffy skirts made of
what appeared to be a flower.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
real you know, not like the Muggles think. Imagination, ha!"
scoffed a wizened little old witch from a curtained doorway they had
not noticed. "Even when they do notice things they think it's
their imagination." The little old witch had twinkling blues eyes
and was grinning, showing two rows of crooked white teeth.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
look like little fairy babies," said Ginny, smiling as the little
chubby figurines clambered to their feet and toddled along the edge
of the shelf on which they were perched.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
are," said the little old witch, "Gumnut Babies. The Muggles
think one of them invented them you know … Muggles, it's obvious
she was a witch, how else would she know about them?</p><p class="calibre8">"Some
say they must be enchanted to remain babies forever as they never
grow up, born babies and die babies. I think they just look different
as grown up fairies. Live in the bush, they do. Smaller than those
figurines mind you, no bigger than your thumb I reckon. Course I've
never seen one myself, not many people have, too many Banksia Men."
The wizened old witch shook her head sadly. Harry just raised his
eyebrows at Ginny. The woman sounded completely dotty.</p><p class="calibre8">"Course
in areas where there's lots of them Bowtruckles some folks reckon
they seen Gumnut Babies," continued the little old woman, unaware
or uncaring that she was not making much sense to the two British
tourists. "Banksia Men don't like Bowtruckles, crazy introduced
species." Harry shook his head ever so slightly but it was clear
the old woman had no problems with her sight for she told him off at
once.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
saw that young man! Don't you go shaking your head at me! Think I'm
barmy, don't you? Well let me tell you something, I'm as
sprightly as they come. I'm as good as I was back when I was as
young as this little slip of a thing!" she glared at him fiercely,
her blue eyes unrelenting as she advanced towards the counter. "Now
are you going to get some sort of treasure for your young lady or
not? That's what brings you young fellas in. Lord knows I never see
any of you in here on your own account!"</p><p class="calibre8">"But
what are Banksia Men?" asked Ginny quietly as the little Gumnut
Baby figurine climbed onto her outstretched palm and began circling,
its little chest puffed out importantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nasty
little villainous tree creatures," spat the old woman. "Terrible
curse on the poor Gumnut Babies. Still, I suppose the Babies are
introduced as well. Would have done us all some good I reckon if we'd
left well enough alone. I mean it's bad enough we got Hippogriffs
but bringing over Bowtruckles and Pixies is just asking for trouble."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
Banksia Men are native tree folk then?" asked Harry, beginning to
see what she was getting at.</p><p class="calibre8">'Yes,
yes," said the wizened old woman impatiently. "That's what I've
been saying. Bowtruckles get along well with the Turongs as a rule,
live together quite fine but for some reason them Banksia Men get
spooked by Bowtruckles. Suppose it's fitting then that Bowtruckles
can't stand Banksia trees. Much prefer the gum and pine forests, do
Bowtruckles."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
a Turong then is another native tree dweller?" asked Ginny as she
set the Gumnut Baby back on the shelf.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
don't see much of them in the cities though. Only get the
domesticated sort of animal around here," said the old woman
looking pointedly at her watch. "If you want educating in the life
and times of Australian magical folk go ask old Seth at <em class="calibre9">Animalia</em>.
I haven't got time to be educating foreigners about it. Now are you
going to buy something for your young lady or not, Mr Potter?"
Harry started, staring at her in surprise.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
yes," the old witch waved her hand at him huffily. "I'm not so
old as senile and completely unaware of the goings on in this world.
I know who you are." Harry smiled sheepishly as Ginny requested
purchase of the tiny handbag in the window. As he pulled out the
Galleons necessary to purchase the gift for Hermione he noticed Ginny
was gazing wistfully at the little shelf of Gumnut Babies.</p><p class="calibre8">"Go
on, get one," he said softly into her ear. "I like that little
one with the red skirt." Ginny blushed as Harry's breath tickled
her ear and he reached out and squeezed her hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
silly," she protested. "I haven't really got any other
ornaments anyway." Harry heard the longing in her voice and
marveled at the sliver of femininity she was showing. Sometimes in
the midst of her brothers, in a home where money was tight and not
spent on such frivolous trivialities as ornaments, it would be easy
to forget that Ginny was a <em class="calibre9">girl</em>.
Harry reached up and gently lifted down the little figurine in the
red skirt.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
this can be your first one and it can remind you of our first day out
together," he said, smiling. "And when you are an old lady and a
little girl comes and asks why grandma's got a funny little fat
fairy on her dressing table you can tell her that you keep it always
because it was the first gift grandpa ever bought you." Ginny
laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
true, you gave me books in first year," she said. Harry grimaced.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
well I didn't exactly have to buy those, did I? So it's not the
same, not the same at all."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you can't just go buying everything I take a passing fancy to,
Harry," Ginny said as the little old wizened witch wrapped their
purchases and counted out the change.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes
I can," he whispered cheekily, "but I won't, because imagine
how fat I would get if I let you feed me too much chocolate cake!"
Handing her the little box with the Gumnut Baby figurine in it he
pressed a soft kiss to her cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank
you, Harry," Ginny said softly, slipping the little box into her
pocket. Harry thanked the little old witch behind the counter and
they turned to go.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hold
onto him, young lady," said the old witch suddenly. Harry and Ginny
turned. The witch was watching them, a strange glint in her eye that
Harry could not decipher. Ginny just smiled as she took Harry's
hand in hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
will," she assured the old witch, "I haven't let him go, yet."
With that they stepped out into Origin Alley and began walking
leisurely towards a shop with cauldrons piled haphazardly under a
faded awning. Harry slipped his arm around Ginny's shoulders,
pulling her close.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
holding onto you too, you know," he said quietly. "I'm never
going to let you go." Ginny sighed happily and leaned into him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't ever want you to."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
and Ginny found <em class="calibre9">Animalia</em>
several doors away from the tiny shop staffed by the wizened old
witch. A grey haired old wizard with a beard that rivaled Hagrid's,
dressed in rather gubby grey robes, was seated out the front of the
store in a rare patch of sunshine. Harry assumed this was old Seth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mornin',"
said the possible Seth in a low rumbly voice. "Let me know now if
yer comin' inter the store ter buy anything. It'll take me a wee
while to get meself outta this 'ere chair." Ginny looked
thoughtfully at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know that we are buying anything," she said. "Can you
take animals home internationally?" Seth looked up at her,
squinting in what looked like a painful fashion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Depends
on whether or not you can hide 'em in yer pocket lassie," he
grinned showing uneven yellow teeth. "Yer can get permits fer some
things, but yer can't take the birds and reptiles." Ginny peered
into the shop through the rather grubby window.</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodness
you do have an awful lot of reptiles," she said after a moment.
"Where are all the fluffy animals?" Harry tried valiantly to hide
his smirk. Luckily Ginny did not notice but the old man grinned at
Harry and winked as he hoisted himself slowly out of the chair, his
robes straightening out and revealing the name Seth sewn onto them
near the left shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yer
up fer the cost of the permit as well as the fluffy animal, son?"
he asked as he ambled slowly into the shop. "Come in, come in
then!" Harry and Ginny followed him inside. It turned out to be a
fairly large shop filled to the brim with cages upon cages of animals
stacked high on top of one another in a teetering pile until they
reached the ceiling. Behind the parchment strewn counter near the
back were rows and rows of bottles, packets and boxes on rickety
looking shelves. They were marked with labels that proclaimed them
such things as 'owl treats', 'flea powder' and 'tincture
for the affliction of rashes'. A large cage with a magnificent
looking white bird seated inside was standing at one end of the
counter and the bird was spinning around on its perch and bobbing its
head up and down as it stopped and eyed the cages behind it warily.
Harry thought the bird was right to eye those particular cages warily
because he could make out three ashwinders, one very large spider and
a particularly vicious looking cross between an insect and a lizard.</p><p class="calibre8">There
was a vast bank of screened aquariums near the front of the shop and
the side walls were lined with rats, mice and small reptiles. Towards
the back of the shop built in cages and enclosures contained tiny
green and blue birds, yapping dogs and various species of cats. Harry
was contemplating a cage of gamboling kittens wondering if every shop
need remind him of Umbridge today when Ginny let out a little shriek.
Spinning towards the sound he saw her near the reptile aquariums
quite unharmed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
guessing Lizzie poked 'er tongue out at yer?" laughed Seth as he
stood next to the counter, his arm inside the white bird's cage.</p><p class="calibre8">"It-
it's <em class="calibre9">blue</em>!"
stammered Ginny. Harry peered at the aquarium nearest Ginny but saw
only a squat, striped lizard with tiny legs and a short tail.
Investigating the other aquariums he found an eclectic assortment of
miniscule lizards, buzzing insects, a rather alarming looking reptile
that looked like it had a flat sort of ruffle draped over the top of
its head and down its neck, an absolutely enormous lizard with sharp
claws and several snakes. Harry idly spoke to one of the snakes, just
to see what would happen and was pleased to note that nothing did.
The snake remained as motionless as it had been. Seth, the white bird
on his arm, shuffled slowly over to them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
o' course 'er tongue were blue, she's a Blue Tongue," said
Seth. "Wouldn't be any kind of Blue Tongue if she didn't 'ave
a blue tongue." Suddenly the bird on Seth's arm squawked and a
ruffle of yellow feathers suddenly stuck straight up on its head
rather like a mohican.</p><p class="calibre8">"Blue
tongue! Blue tongue!" parroted the bird. "Wouldn't be a Blue
Tongue!" Ginny jumped and Harry laughed while she scowled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I just don't expect lizards to have blue tongues and birds to
talk!" she huffed defensively.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
can't 'urt yer none lassie," said Seth, not unkindly. "Cocky
'ere is a right sociable bird, likes ter talk ter the pretty
lassies." The impressive white bird bobbed its head up and down in
Ginny's direction a few times before stretching its wings and
screeching loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pretty
girl! Pretty girl!" Seth gave Cocky a bird treat and the bird
nipped at his finger playfully before shuffling awkwardly to the end
of his arm and stretched over to investigate Ginny's outstretched
hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"G'wan,
dance Cocky," said Seth.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dance
Cocky! Dance Cocky!" said the bird and it began bobbing up and
down. "Dance Cocky!" It wove from side to side, its yellow crest
of feathers bobbing up and down and Ginny laughed delightedly. The
bird stopped and looked at Ginny, its head tilted to one side. Ginny
stretched out her finger again and the bird bent down to nip her
finger before it began dancing again, following the direction of her
finger. Ginny noticed and began waving her hand in the air, the bird
following her every move.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dance
Cocky!" squawked the bird once more before suddenly spreading its
wings and taking flight. It moved so suddenly as it flew up to the
rafters that the reptile with the flat ruffle draped on its head and
the Blue Tongue both seemed to jump and hiss. The Blue Tongue exposed
its tongue again and the other suddenly reared up on its hind legs
and flared the ruffle out, baring its teeth. Harry who was still
standing next to that one jumped, alarmed, and Ginny burst out
laughing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
laugh," grumbled Harry, scowling. Ginny shook with laughter and
Seth shook his head sadly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yer
better come up the back 'ere and 'ave a gander at the more
domesticated sort of animals," he said, shuffling back to the
counter, "right jumpy, yer lot."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
trailed after Ginny as she wandered past meowing cats and the odd
Kneazle, a fluffy white rabbit and a few rather excitable Puffskeins.
Harry watched Ginny coo at the animals and contemplated that today
was the first time he had been able to take the time to simply watch
Ginny and see what spiked her interest and what held her attention.
He knew that she loved cats and that she was fond of Arnold. He also
surmised that she had a particular liking for birds as she had always
had more patience with Errol than anyone else and Hedwig had been
particularly gentle with her. Her recent antics with Cocky and back
home with Liberty simply confirmed this for him and he made mental
notes as he watched her fondly. He felt that such careful observation
of her character was adequate recompense for the fact that walking
behind her also gave him ample opportunity to observe her swaying
hips and … other areas of her anatomy.</p><p class="calibre8">He'd
done the same, of course, in the little curio shop and now knew that
she liked pretty hair things in muted, rather than garish colours,
disliked large beaded necklaces and overly ornate hair brushes and
had somewhat of a penchant for tiny baby fairy figurines. As Ginny
bent over to pat a rather excitable small puppy that seemed to have a
propensity for falling over its own feet, Harry stopped to appreciate
the view while he contemplated what sort of jewelry she might like.
His guess was something small and delicate, understated and
definitely not flashy. Perhaps he could test his theory out, if they
found a jewelry shop. He was roused from his musings by the increased
agitation of the puppy which was now trying to jump out of the
enclosure, scrabbling fiercely at the door, falling over every time
she jumped.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
dear, you've got yerself a right problem now," muttered Seth.
"Downright ridiculously loyal Creelers are."</p><p class="calibre8">"Creeler?
Isn't that just a dog?" asked Harry, gesturing at the enclosure,
perplexed. Seth shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nup.
That there is a Creeler," he said emphatically. "Some bright
spark thought it would be a good idea to breed a Crup and a Blue
Heeler. Now you got the intense loyalty of a Crup mixed with the
intelligence and loyalty of a Heeler. And what yer gets is one mighty
loyal dog that seems to know which witch or wizard they want to
belong ter. And unless I miss my guess, and I never do, that Creeler
there has picked <em class="calibre9">her</em>."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
look, Harry!" cried Ginny. "Isn't she beautiful?" The small
white puppy had a large black patch over one eye and ear, a stout
little body and strong muscular legs. Her ears flopped about as she
trotted across the enclosure to get a look at Harry. Her tail had
already been docked and she sported another patch on one shoulder.
She nearly overbalanced as she sat down, cocking her head curiously
at Harry, looking at him with big, soulful eyes. Harry could not
fathom how Ginny had taught her that in such a short period of time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
all I can say is our firstborn had better be a boy, because I'm
already outnumbered," was all Harry said with a sigh as he held out
his hand and said, "better get that paperwork."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
arranged with Seth to have the Creeler stay there until they left for
home. At first Seth had been sceptical that the permits would go
through in such a short time, explaining that he'd always found the
British Ministry to be particularly slow at processing animal permit
requests because the Minister himself had to rubber stamp them
personally. Ginny assured him that it was not going to be a problem
this time and suggested that they send the paperwork straight to
Percy so that it didn't get waylaid by some well meaning Ministry
official. When he realised that they knew the Minister personally
Seth agreed to keep the Creeler until they were ready to leave
because it was patently unfair, and probably not possible, to drag
the animal around Australia on a bus.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
can stay with Hagrid while we're in school," chattered Ginny
excitedly as they left <em class="calibre9">Animalia</em>,
the paperwork clutched tightly in her hand and Harry's money pouch
considerably lighter. "He'll love that, a new breed and
everything. Oh she's just so cute, Harry. Did you see her big brown
eyes? And she's got that adorable patch over one eye. We have to
think of a name for her!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
reminds me of Tonks," mused Harry as he crossed the street to the
Post Office. Suddenly realising what that sounded like he stammered,
"n-not that Tonks was in any way a dog. It's the clumsy thing …"
he trailed off uncertainly as Ginny stopped dead in the middle of the
street and he pulled her to the side just in time to stop her being
run over by an erratic witch on a bicycle who turned to wave a fist
at them threateningly and promptly rode into a pile of cauldrons,
both rider and cauldrons clattering to the ground, bringing the
proprietor of the cauldron shop out, shrieking. Ginny watched the
altercation as the bike riding witch huffily straightened out the
wheel of her bicycle with a well aimed spell and then Ginny turned
her glistening eyes to Harry. He was alarmed because he did not think
she'd been so upset as to be crying over a near miss with a
cyclist.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong?" Harry asked warily but Ginny surprised him by smiling at
him and throwing her arms around his neck. She sniffed and swiped at
the corners of her eyes.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
perfect," she whispered to him and proceeded to give him quite the
most delightful snog he had experienced in quite some time, since
breakfast, in fact. Harry was not one to pass up, or question, a good
snog, and wrapped his arms around her waist as he got into the spirit
of things by coaxing her tongue back into his own mouth and sliding
one hand up into her hair. He had no idea what had been perfect
before the kiss but he was pretty sure that <em class="calibre9">now</em>,
it was this moment.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
eventually pulled away and looked up at him, the parchment forms
clutched in her hand behind his head, rustled in the slight breeze
and her eyes shone, lips swollen. Harry smiled. She beamed back.
Smoothing her hair and tugging lightly on the ends Harry said,</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
perfect?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Her
name," breathed Ginny. "You thought of the most perfect name!"
Harry frowned.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
did?" Ginny nodded enthusiastically.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
going to name her after Tonks!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You
want to call her Tonks?" Harry asked somewhat suspiciously. It
seemed about as appropriate as calling a vicious three headed dog
Fluffy. Ginny shook her head impatiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
we're going to call her Dora!" she exclaimed, "Dora the dog!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
a Creeler," corrected Harry automatically. Ginny waved her hand
impatiently behind his head and the parchment she was holding rustled
against his head in a rather annoying fashion.</p><p class="calibre8">"Details,
details," she proclaimed as she untangled herself from his embrace
and grabbed his hand, dragging him into the Post Office where they
were stopped abruptly by a rather annoyed looking wizard in a most
unbecoming pointed hat.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
young people today have absolutely no propriety!" he said, waving
his finger at them in what he obviously thought was a menacing
fashion before stalking out the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
don't worry about old Vernon," came a bright voice from the rear
of the Post Office. "I swear he's been grumpy since the day he
was born!" Harry rather thought the name was appropriate and he
stuck his head out into the street to watch Vernon stop and berate a
small boy who was waving a lollipop carelessly as he skipped along
the footpath.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cheery
fellow," said Harry sarcastically has he drew his head back into
the shop and focused on the Postmistress who was sorting parcels and
tying them to the legs of some rather interesting birds that rather
reminded him of Cocky. She finished her task and came forward to the
counter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now,
what can I help you two with today?" she said. Her eyes crinkled up
at the corners pleasantly when she smiled and her hair was sneakily
escaping the bun she had tied it in. She wore a large apron with
oversized pockets that bulged with pieces of string.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
need the quickest way to send this back to London," explained
Ginny. The Postmistress rummaged under the counter for a moment and
pulled out a rather large envelope.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
your best bet is sending it by Mail Portkey. You could send it by
birds but it takes an awful long time and there's always the risk
of it getting lost in one of the transfers," as she spoke she
opened a drawer and withdrew a roll of Spellotape, a pot of ink and a
quill. "It's a bit more expensive mind but a lot quicker. It
should be there this time tomorrow." Ginny quickly filled out the
paperwork required for a Mail Portkey and the witch behind the
counter sealed their permit application in the envelope. Summoning
down a Barn Owl she attached the envelope to its leg and sent it to
the International Portkey Station at the Airport while Harry counted
out the appropriate fee.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
so beautiful," breathed Ginny. Harry looked up to see a pale pink
bird had swooped in bearing a large box and landed on the counter.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
not getting a bird, Ginny," he said warily but Ginny just laughed.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
sort of bird is it?" she asked the Postmistress. "It looks a bit
like Cocky."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
that's because it is a cocky!" laughed the Postmistress, untying
the parcel from its leg and letting the cocky fly up to a perch above
the window where Harry could see a collection of similar birds in
different hues ranging from majestic black with a red tail, through
to grey and yellow and the impressive white they had seen before. The
pink bird seemed to lord it over them all in splendor despite the
fact that after taking a long drink it tucked its head under its wing
and went to sleep.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
you just used an owl," said Ginny in confusion. "Why was that
bird bringing mail?" The Postmistress finished tying the large
parcel to a large owl which took off through a specially designed
hole in the roof before answering.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
most of the Australian owls are endangered," she explained simply.
"There's a decent amount of Barn Owls and Boobooks and a few
others but there's just not that many owls really. Occasionally you
get a few Rurus, New Zealand Boobooks they are, hanging about as well
on the East coast like here but basically the Barn Owl's just not
as adapted to the climates as Cockatoos.</p><p class="calibre8">"Galahs
are completely useless of course, dozy birds, and Corellas are just
too small to carry anything much but they are earnest little things,
some folks like 'em. There's just too many climates here and no
one bird suitable to fly them all. Those Major Mitchell's are
suited to the Western Deserts," she stopped and indicated the
magnificent pink bird that had flown in earlier. "So if you're
wanting to send something to or from there you use a Major Mitchell
for that bit. You can get those white ones – Sulphur Crested they
are, to go up north or along the east coast. Your Black ones will go
south west and your grey down south, really very easy once you get
the hang of it. Owls and Boobooks you can use for shorter trips but
they get a bit disoriented if you try and get 'em to fly across too
much desert."</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodness,"
said Ginny in wonder, "the distances sure do make things tricky
around here."</p><p class="calibre8">"Bit
of a nasty shock for some people," nodded the Postmistress. "You
can't just expect to be in the next city by lunchtime. It can take
days to get to the top end if Ernie's having a busy time of it on
the bus."</p><p class="calibre8">"Days?"
Ginny's eyes widened. "How can it take days?"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
just that big, love," shrugged the Postmistress as if this were
completely normal. "If Ernie's got enough stops and you're the
last one to get on, well you could be waiting a while. Always best to
bring a packed lunch or two on the bus. Course it never usually takes
that long, but most people like to be prepared."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
hope it doesn't take days to get to wherever it was Hermione said
we're going," muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
you're going on the bus then?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,"
Ginny nodded, "down south somewhere, tomorrow."</p><p class="calibre8">"Best
take a lunch then," said the Postmistress nodding sagely. "Mondays
is when the chess club all gets on. Got a standing booking they have,
every Sunday they get on the bus and come here to play chess and
every Monday off they go home. Ernie sometimes complains it takes him
all day to take the chess club home never mind the rest of the
passengers." Harry thought that being trapped on a bus with an
entire chess club was not the most promising thing he'd ever heard
of.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron
should appreciate that then," Ginny mused as they left the post
office. "I wonder how long it will take though." Harry just
shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">They
continued their lazy stroll down Origin Alley, buying Kiwi flavoured
ice cream at a small stall next to a barber and browsing an extensive
bookstore. The sign in the apothecary window proclaimed that it would
sell Billywigs only to persons of age and they both spent quite some
time fossicking in the Sports Supply store and exploring the AQL
teams and specialised Quidditch gear for the Australian climates.
They picked up a book on Australian Quidditch for Ron, a rather fancy
quill for Hermione and something called a mystery box for George from
a joke and costume shop, hoping that it would do something
interesting that would enable them to take the mickey out of him.</p><p class="calibre8">They
kept to no timetable, stopping for lunch only when Ginny's stomach
rumbled loudly causing her to blush in embarrassment and Harry to
double over with laughter. Harry watched carefully as Ginny pressed
her nose to a jeweller's window and pointed out a rather ornate
glittering necklace she thought her mother would love and then
studied the delicate chains and small glittering pendants, exclaiming
over several that featured a small stone that flashed with many
different colours. Ginny did not attempt to enter this store either
and Harry, deciding that he stood no chance of buying her a surprise
birthday gift today, did not enter either but he had guessed
correctly about her jewellery preferences. He smiled to himself as
they moved away from the jewelry store arm in arm, towards a window
filled mannequins dressed in a variety of dress and every day robes.</p><p class="calibre8">The
shadows lengthened and it grew colder as they huddled together,
walking back towards the hotel and Harry looked up into the fading
blue sky and thought how it had been a wonderful day and how much he
had learned just by being with Ginny on a peaceful day filled with
sunshine and her smile. They'd done simple things together, bought
gifts for family and friends, sent mail and sampled food; they'd
even bought themselves a pet. It was the sort of peaceful future he'd
dreamed of with Ginny and he smiled softly to himself as he hugged
her closer and decided that if he dared to dream them, then perhaps
his dreams really would come true.</p>
