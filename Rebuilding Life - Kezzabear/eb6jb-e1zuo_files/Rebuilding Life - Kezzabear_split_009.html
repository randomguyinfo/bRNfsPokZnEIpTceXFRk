<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_10">*Chapter 9*: Chapter 9</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">Remembering
Fred</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Everyone
gradually relaxed after Ron and Harry had cleared the air although
Bill still looked at Harry, when he thought Harry wasn't looking,
as if there was still some mystery to be solved. Harry listened as
conversation around them gradually started up.</p><p class="calibre8">"I want to
replant the garden, when we get home," said Mrs Weasley. "Perhaps
there will even be time to fix up The Burrow a bit."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, it's
overdue for a painting I'd say," mused Mr Weasley. "I wonder
what it will be like to work for the Ministry under Kingsley
Shacklebolt. I expect that after the horrible place it has recently
been I'll more likely be fixing things up for a while rather than
chasing biting teakettles." Percy engaged his father at once in a
discussion about working for the Ministry and where he might set his
sights next. Harry's attention wandered to other conversations.</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't
leave just yet," Charlie said softly to Bill, "but I do want to
go back to the dragons."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't even
know if I still have a job," said Bill. "If the war's affected
how Gringotts runs ..."</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione was
talking animatedly to Fleur about completing her magical education
but the conversation that transfixed Harry began when Ron questioned
George about what he was going to do when they left Hogwarts and
began to settle back into life again.</p><p class="calibre8">"I've got to
back and see what the shop's like, haven't I?" George began. "I
mean we left plenty of charms on it but who knows what sort of state
things are in. I expect Auntie Muriel's a bit swamped in Owl Orders
by now as well. They were coming in thick and fast a couple of days
ago. Oh she's going to be furious with us for leaving that cauldron
going, come to think of it. There will be so much we have to do. I
wonder if Verity will be able to come back and work for us. She's a
great little shop assistant and-" George broke off abruptly. He
sighed as he scrubbed a hand over his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Auntie
Muriel's not going to be furious with us, is she?" he said
tonelessly. "And Verity isn't going to work for us at all. We
don't have a lot of work to do. I do. Just me. There <em class="calibre9">is</em>
no us anymore." He turned to Ron suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"How do you do
it? Be, just yourself; just me. Just I, no <em class="calibre9">us</em>?
I can't even think of me as an 'I'. I keep saying us. How am I
going to live by myself, with no us, with just me?" George's
voice dropped to a whisper that Harry only barely caught. "How do I
just be me Ron? I don't think I can be alone. I've never been
alone." Ron gazed solemnly at George before reaching out a hand and
resting it on George's arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"You won't be
alone, George. I know I'm not Fred but I won't leave you alone,"
Ron looked resolutely at George. "I'll be there."</p><p class="calibre8">"What about
your seventh year?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll figure
something out."</p><p class="calibre8">"You would do
that? For me? Because I don't know how to be alone?" Ron nodded.
George studied Ron for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay, but you
can tell Mum!" Ron laughed. It rang out across the Great Hall. It
didn't take long for George to join him.</p><p class="calibre8">As the dishes
vanished down to the kitchens below people began drifting over to the
group of Weasleys. Soon there was a large group of current and former
Gryffindors crowded around the table telling stories and reminiscing.
Charlie soon had the group listening avidly to a recount of his first
Quidditch match. Harry looked over at Ginny who was listening to her
brother, a smile on her face. He watched her for a while, his hand
still resting in hers before he slowly began to trace lines between
the freckles on her arm. The small gap that had been between them
diminished as Harry began playing with her hair and the back of her
neck. Ginny still hadn't turned to look at him but somehow she was
in his lap and his nose was buried in her hair as he nuzzled the side
of her neck behind her ear.</p><p class="calibre8">"So, Potter,
have you got a better Seeker catch than that?" challenged Charlie
when he finished his story. "And do I have to watch you two do
that?" Harry blushed. Not only did he have no idea how Charlie had
caught the Snitch in his first game but he'd been caught out by one
of Ginny's brothers while totally lost in her scent; the heady rush
he got from just being near her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, tell
Charlie your first match, Harry," suggested Oliver Wood, who was
sitting opposite Harry. "I reckon that was pretty impressive!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I suppose
it is a pretty good story." Harry grinned. "And I don't think
Charlie would appreciate the story of my first practice – you know,
the one where you told me that you'd not be surprised if I was a
better Seeker than Charlie Weasley."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why would
anybody tell you a thing like that?" Charlie grumbled.</p><p class="calibre8">"My first match
I was so nervous I couldn't eat," Harry said, smirking at
Charlie. "We were playing Slytherin and I'd never even seen a
Quidditch match before. And yet Professor McGonagall had said how I'd
caught Neville's Remembrall during flying lessons, after a fifty
foot dive without a scratch and Charlie Weasley couldn't even have
done it, it was a lot to live up to!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought you
were going to tell us about your first match, Potter, not how
everyone thought you were better than me," Charlie muttered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just setting
the scene," Harry smiled. "Halfway through the game I'm up
above all the other players, so pretty high, and my broomstick starts
going nuts and I was dangling off it with one hand. Actually, let's
skip the bit about why. So when it stopped I got back on, how I
managed that so high in the air without falling I'll never know.</p><p class="calibre8">"I saw the
Snitch and I just headed into a dive to catch it. Brilliant dive by
the way. There I am, hurtling to the ground when I caught it … in
my mouth. Nearly swallowed it actually. Of course it wasn't exactly
graceful since I let go of the broomstick to clap my hand over my
mouth and fell onto the ground. Oh wait, I've got it here …"
Harry reached into his pouch and found it, pulling it out. It fell in
two halves on his palm.</p><p class="calibre8">"It seems like
a lifetime ago," said Hermione. Harry sat quietly contemplating the
Snitch and remembering that during the match Voldemort was actually
trying to kill him and Snape was trying to save him. They were events
that took on a whole new meaning for him now.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wonder if we
are going to have Quidditch next year," mused Ginny. "There
wasn't any this year, not that we'd have stood much of a chance
really, down a Chaser and the Keeper and Seeker and Captain missing
in action. I'd love to play next year."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well the
Seeker and Captain were one and the same," Ron said, "It's not
like you were missing four players. I reckon if they'd had
Quidditch you still could have fielded a side. You had Beaters didn't
you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Reserve Chaser
wasn't about either and who do you think was going to be Keeper?
McClaggen had left anyway but it's not like there's any other
contenders," continued Ginny, "I don't know how we're going
to field a team next year anyway. Guess I won't be playing any more
Quidditch."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well," said
Harry slowly, "you'll have to try out like everyone else or it'll
look like favouritism, but I'd say you've got a pretty good
chance of making the team." Ginny spun around so quickly she nearly
fell off his lap. Harry smiled at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you
know, Harry?" she asked, "What do you know that I don't know?"
Harry casually reached into a pocket and withdrew the Quidditch
Captain's badge he'd received from Professor McGonagall the night
before.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll let you
know when trials are when we get back," he said offhandedly. "I
haven't decided when to hold them yet." Ginny stared at the
badge.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
coming back to Hogwarts? You'll be here, next year?" she said in
wonderment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I'll
be here," Harry said. "I've hardly been on a broom this year
though."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh that won't
make any difference Harry! You never miss the Snitch!" called
Oliver Wood.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, because
someone drummed it into him in Second Year to catch the Snitch or die
trying!" George yelled. "He's taken that on board you know!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I did miss it
third year though," Harry said. "When I fell off during that
Hufflepuff match and Cedric caught it. Fred reckoned you were trying
to drown yourself afterwards!" Harry had managed to say both
Cedric's and Fred's names without flinching and only a slight
tremor of the badge he was holding gave away his emotions.</p><p class="calibre8">"Pffft, Harry,"
said George, "If you are going to relive that memorable moment when
you were devastated and Wood was suicidal because we lost a Quidditch
match, you have to do it right! Here, you lay down and be all banged
up from falling fifty feet, shouldn't be too hard, you look about
as good now as you did then, only taller. Wood, remember to sulk, and
Harry, moan about losing to <em class="calibre9">Hufflepuff</em>."
George leapt onto the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Remember what
Fred said before we left?" George asked Harry. "I'll
impersonate him, since none of you sods will do as good a job as me."
George turned to Charlie and winked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't beat
yourself up, Harry, you're still the <em class="calibre9">best</em>
Seeker we've ever had!" George finished with a flourish.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!"
protested Charlie. "You guys are supposed to be on my side!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred, do get
down off that table!" Mrs Weasley said absently as she hurried
past. The silence was deafening. George remained standing on the
table; his eyes followed his mother as she hurried away. The rest of
them held their breath.</p><p class="calibre8">"And she calls
herself our mother," muttered George. He turned to the group
sitting around the table. "Told you I do a downright accurate
impersonation of Fred!" The silence was still laying over the group
like a thick blanket when George climbed down from the table. Harry
could see that George's knuckles were white as he grabbed the edge
of the table, holding on as if to steady himself. Suddenly George
burst out, desperately, as if trying to fill the giant void that had
opened up in the room,</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry! I have
a great idea!" his voice was unnaturally loud. "Let's play
Quidditch!"</p><p class="calibre8">"What? It's
kind of dark," Harry started. George waved him off impatiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not now,
tomorrow. We've got all the old team here," he waved in the
direction of Oliver, Katie, Angelina and Alicia. "Well, al-almost
anyway, we can play together, like old times and you can get some
practice in. Wouldn't do for the Gryffindor Captain to be so out of
practice he has to drop himself from the team!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who are we
going to play?" Harry asked cautiously, he wasn't at all sure how
stable George's emotions were.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I can't
think of everything! Are there enough Ravenclaws here?" George's
voice seemed to be wavering and he was speaking almost too fast to
understand him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll find a
team," came Charlie's unexpected voice. "I'd like the chance
to settle who is really the best Seeker Gryffindor's ever had."
He winked at Harry, his eyes watching George carefully. Bill was
looking thoughtful.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
really good actually," he glanced around to check where Mrs Weasley
was. "If we are playing Quidditch we have the perfect opportunity
to be at the pitch – setting the fireworks. I'll be your Keeper,
Charlie."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey!" said
Ron. "I wanted to be Keeper!"</p><p class="calibre8">"We need
another Beater," George said to him. "Come and be a Beater with
me." His tone was almost pleading and Harry didn't know how much
longer George would be able to hold himself together. Ginny went over
to George and hugged him. With her arms still around his neck she
said quietly,</p><p class="calibre8">"Playing a
match is a great way to remember Fred. I think it's a brilliant
idea." Wrapping his arms around his sister George laid his head on
the top of hers and let his tears fall unrestrained at last.</p><p class="calibre8">**********************</p><p class="calibre8">"I can't
believe you've talked me into this Charlie!" Percy exclaimed
early the next morning, holding a broomstick as if it was about to
explode.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh come on
Perce! I was running out of options. We need someone! You're all I
could think of!" Harry was trying valiantly not to laugh at the
thought of Percy acting as a Beater. Charlie had managed to convince
Dean and Seamus to be Chasers with Ginny who had jumped at the chance
to play Quidditch. Bill had cornered Neville and pleaded with him to
be one of their Beaters but they had still been one beater short.
Bill was currently trying to sweet talk Madam Hooch into giving them
some practice Quidditch balls. Mrs Weasley had not tried to talk them
out of playing Quidditch. It seemed as though she thought they
deserved a day to have fun. She admonished them all not to hurt
themselves however.</p><p class="calibre8">Bill and George
had hastily conferred and informed the others that they'd practice
in the morning and put the fireworks securely in place then. Lee
Jordan had been drumming up a crowd to come and watch the actual
match later that afternoon, after the grounds had been set up for the
memorial the next day. Hermione had set herself the task of
transfiguring ordinary robes into rudimentary Quidditch gear to
distinguish the teams. Ron had tracked down enough broomsticks and
he, Harry and Ginny had spent time cleaning and repairing them
suitable for flying. Everything was set except Percy now seemed to be
backing out at the last minute.</p><p class="calibre8">"I got the
practice balls!" Bill exclaimed climbing through the portrait hole.
"It's easy to get anything you want if you tell someone Harry
wants it." Harry scowled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I know,"
said Ron. "Just tell them Harry's after a few broomsticks and
suddenly they find their keys to the broomshed!" Harry's face
darkened.</p><p class="calibre8">"They're
teasing Harry," said Ginny. "I was with Ron when he wheedled the
keys out of McGonagall and he didn't mention you at all."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, it's
not funny," grumbled Harry who had not slept particularly well the
night before. "I'm going back to bed; wake me up when you all go
down for practice." He could feel everyone's eyes on him as he
climbed the stairs to his dorm. He closed the door to his dormitory
behind him and slumped against it. He had not experienced nightmares
the night before but every time he closed his eyes he'd seen either
a pair of red eyes or flashes of green light or his sleep had been
restless and interrupted. He'd soon given up trying to sleep
shortly before dawn and sat in the Common Room, pretending he'd
only been up for a few minutes when he'd been discovered shortly
before breakfast by an agitated Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">His exhaustion
must have been the antidote to the visions of red and green and he
fell asleep within minutes of crawling into his bed and pulling the
covers up to his chin.</p><p class="calibre8">He wasn't sure
how long he'd slept when he felt a pillow crash down on his head
and a voice yelling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Get up
lazybones! It's Quidditch time!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron, keep it
down to a dull roar," Harry complained as he crawled out of bed.
Ron threw a set of transfigured Quidditch robes at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"C'mon, get
dressed, let's go!" Ron seemed hyperactive but Harry couldn't
help smiling because he hadn't seen Ron this excited for a long
time. As they stumbled down the last few steps and burst into the
Common Room Harry saw Charlie and Bill still trying to convince Percy
to play. It was not going well. Apparently during their practice,
while Harry had been sleeping, Percy had <em class="calibre9">not</em>
had a good time. Suddenly a flurry of activity burst across the room
as Fleur leapt out of her chair and strode across the room, snatching
the broomstick from Percy's grasp.</p><p class="calibre8">"I weel do
eet!" she huffed. "I do not know why you deed not ask me before!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Er, you play
Quidditch, Fleur?" asked Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Of course I
can play Quiddeetch! Why you have not asked me zat before I do not
know," she huffed, nose to nose with Charlie. "Of course I do not
<em class="calibre9">like</em> to
play zis game on brooms and I 'ave not played Beater before, but
'ow 'ard can zat be? You 'ave too many bruzzers and forget zat
women are capable of zings!" She looked quite ferocious and as she
turned away to snatch the last set of transfigured robes form
Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well if all
women are like you I'm glad I haven't got any more sisters thank
you very much," said Charlie under his breath. Harry was not
surprised to see Ginny turn on him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What exactly
does that mean?" Charlie cowered, she had her wand out. Ron grew
impatient and began bouncing on the balls of his feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who cares what
that means," he whined. "I wanna go play Quidditch!" Ginny
began spluttering.</p><p class="calibre8">"You-you, I,
well, you're just – BOYS!" She stomped away from Charlie and
made to move past Ron and Harry when he reached out and pulled her to
him, dipping her exaggeratedly and giving her a big smacking kiss
amidst a chorus of wolf whistles and groans, the latter definitely
came from Charlie and Ron, before setting her upright again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Something
wrong with boys, Ginny?" he smirked. Ginny, whose face was now
tinged with pink and wore a rather dreamy smile, shook her head.
Harry released her and trailing his arm down to her hand, squeezed
it, saying,</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
after practice, at lunch," before he turned and climbed out of the
portrait hole with Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">*****************</p><p class="calibre8">It felt good to
fly again. It was exhilarating to fly with his old team. After
setting their packages of fireworks with the help of Lee Jordan and
Hagrid (who had hugged Harry and squeezed him so hard that Harry was
sure he'd almost cracked more than one rib), the team put
themselves through some drills and played a number of games Oliver
Wood showed them designed to practice Quidditch skills. By the time
it came to playing the match Harry's team seemed confident and
excited.</p><p class="calibre8">The stands were
packed, it was as though everyone currently staying at the castle had
come to watch the match. Lee Jordan was commentating, though it
seemed he had a hard time convincing Luna she need not assist. Harry
found it hard to contain a smirk as he flew past to see Lee mouthing
'Loser's Lurgy?'
at the back of her head. Madam Hooch had agreed to referee the match
and as Oliver and Charlie shook hands Harry soared upwards feeling
freer than he had in quite some time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Welcome to the
Inaugural Fred Weasley Memorial Quidditch Match!" announced Lee.
That was new; Harry had not known they'd given it a name. As Lee
announced the players of each team, who had been dubbed 'The Best
Team Ever' and 'The Challengers' by Lee he noticed Charlie rise
up to join him, high above the other players.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ready,
Potter?" he challenged.</p><p class="calibre8">"Absolutely,
Weasley," Harry returned, grinning. "You are so going down."
Madam Hooch released the balls and blew the whistle to start. Harry
began scanning for the Snitch, flying around the pitch with ease
despite the rather dodgy broom he was on.</p><p class="calibre8">It took a while
to get used to the quirks of the broom, it wasn't anywhere near as
fast as his Firebolt had been but his skills as a flier paid off and
he soon had the broom responding exactly as he liked, if at about
half the speed. As Lee commented on the manoeuvres
by the Chasers Harry found himself watching Ginny, her face flushed
with excitement and her ponytail streaming behind her. Charlie
swooped past him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're not
going to find the Snitch that way mate," he laughed. Harry forced
his attention back to the job at hand.</p><p class="calibre8">It seemed no one
had taken Fleur's assertion that she could play Quidditch seriously
and equally clear that they should have. Angelina, Katie and Alicia
spent more time dodging bludgers sent by Fleur than playing the
Quaffle. This was balanced somewhat by Oliver being a much better
keeper than Bill by virtue of his professional Quidditch experience.
George and Ron seemed to delight in sending bludgers at Ginny in what
Harry assumed was an attempt at getting him distracted for a laugh.
It had the advantage of distracting Charlie who constantly flew
between Ginny, to see if she was alright and Ron and George, to
reprimand them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Would you two
idiots stop that!" bellowed Bill at his siblings exasperatedly
after his mother had screamed several times at the sight of a Bludger
heading Ginny's way. Ron and George looked at each other sheepishly
and then hit the approaching Bludgers at Dean who, nearly unseated
from his broom, swore at them.</p><p class="calibre8">After that
Charlie spent his time alternating between various strategies that
other Seekers had used on Harry before. When Charlie decided to tail
Harry, he led him on a merry chase right through the centre of the
pitch, easily dodging the Quaffle and the Bludgers that knocked
Charlie sideways. At one stage Harry thought he had seen the Snitch
and headed down the pitch but the glint of gold vanished before he'd
gone more than a few feet. As the match wore on he found it harder
and harder to shake the other Seeker. Lee's exuberant
commentary was, for once, largely uninterrupted by Professor
McGonagall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wood blocks a
fabulous attempt at a goal by Ginny Weasley, she's a great Chaser
that one, could we see her in the professional league one day? And
Bell, looking mighty fine I must say, has got the Quaffle for The
Best Team Ever and she scores! Bill Weasley should stick to his day
job! No, Luna, I don't think he's been attacked by Wrackspurts, I
think he's just not a very good player!</p><p class="calibre8">"Oooh that has
<em class="calibre9">got</em> to
hurt, Fleur Weasley has just sent a Bludger that's hit all three
opposing Chasers leaving the space wide open for all of theirs to
assault the goals – Wood, you can't save goals by ducking! And
The Challengers score and it's 90 – 120 in favour of The
Challengers, who on the whole are probably just relying on Ginny and
Fleur – Neville you're not supposed to duck the bludgers, hit
them man!" Ron and George seemed to change tactics then and began
hurling Bludgers at Neville to take him out.</p><p class="calibre8">"He can face
Voldemort but he can't face a tiny little iron ball!" Harry heard
Ron say as he swooped past him. It was then that Harry realised Fleur
had changed her own tactics and was directing Bludgers that came her
way to Harry. He began a complex weaving pattern designed to evade
them, putting distance between himself and Charlie as he did so.</p><p class="calibre8">As he drew up in
front of the commentary box he noticed Lee desperately trying to
convince Luna that the weather conditions were not worthy of comment
and he really needed to get back to the game. Percy had obviously
been thrust the magical megaphone and was staring at it in distaste.
He looked up and past Harry before raising it to his lips.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think
Charlie's seen the Snitch!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry swore and
spun around. Charlie Weasley was indeed hurtling rapidly across the
pitch but following his trajectory Harry knew he wasn't heading for
the Snitch, plus he saw it glinting near Oliver's head. His eyes on
the Snitch, Harry flew at a steady pace towards Oliver who was
hovering near the middle goal ring. It didn't take long for Charlie
to abandon the feint and begin circling the pitch. As the Snitch
darted towards the ground Charlie seemed to have caught the flash it
made as it changed direction and both Seekers were now heading for
the Snitch, their acceleration making it apparent that they were both
seeking the real target.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry took off
after the Snitch which rapidly changed course several times, while
deftly dodging Bludgers sent by a recovered Neville and a ferocious
Fleur. George and Ron soon joined him to hit the Bludgers back at
Charlie who was rapidly catching up. The Snitch led them the length
of the pitch about four feet from the ground before rapidly spiraling
upwards. Harry saw Ron go spiraling out of control towards the
ground, righting himself only inches from the ground, before he tore
upwards after the Snitch, Charlie close on his tail.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry sped past
Bill, nearly knocking the older man off his broom, leveled off and
tore across the pitch once more as he gained on the Snitch. Suddenly
the Snitch dove earthward and Harry followed it without hesitation,
the ancient school broom hurtling towards the earth with the speed of
a rocket.</p><p class="calibre8">"And Potter is
gaining on the Snitch, Charlie Weasley is totally on his tail, their
reputations as Gryffindor's best Seeker is at stake here, ladies
and gentlemen, you will have the answer to that question settled this
afternoon and if I am not mistaken Potter's going to take out the
title!" Lee did not distract Harry; his focus was on that tiny
gold, winged ball. The ground was hurtling up to meet him at an
accelerated rate and he thought he could hear Mrs Weasley scream
something about foolishness and if her boys didn't meet their
deaths this way she would kill them herself.</p><p class="calibre8">A scant few
inches from the ground the Snitch leveled out and Harry forced
himself to remain hurtling towards the earth until the last moment.
He felt Charlie pull out of the dive a few seconds earlier and as he
pulled up sharply to skim the grass with his toes, Harry stretched
out his arm to the Snitch and felt the ancient broom wobble
precariously. It had obviously not taken the sharp turn and
deceleration well and began to thrash from side to side. Desperately
struggling to hold the broom on course Harry urged it forward,
coaxing a few more feet out of it before he
closed his hand around the Snitch and raised it triumphantly.</p><p class="calibre8">The crowd cheered
and Lee punched the air, declaring, "Harry Potter is the best
Seeker Gryffindor has ever seen!"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry felt the
broom shudder and dart upwards. He clung with one hand on the broom
as the broomstick wove dangerously from side to side, gaining
altitude before suddenly losing all power and speed and dropping
suddenly, heading to the ground below, it's descent completely
untamed. He considered that not actually being on the Quidditch team
seemed not to affect whether or not he could go through a year
without serious incident or injury during Quidditch as he hit the
ground and blacked out.</p>
