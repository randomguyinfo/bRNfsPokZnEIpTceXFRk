<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_9">*Chapter 8*: Chapter 8</h2>
			<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre4">Finding
Family</strong></p><p class="calibre8">It was quite some
time before Harry raised his head and decided he had better get
moving. He was surprised that no one had run after him but he wasn't
about to bemoan his fortune. He idly wandered along the secret
passage which he knew would take him to a door near the greenhouses,
as long as it hadn't been blocked or otherwise blown apart during
the battle. He needed to return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's
tomb. He wondered if he could do that without being seen but soon
cursed his own idiocy, his Invisibility Cloak was in his pouch along
with practically everything else he currently owned, which wasn't
much; his razor (which he most definitely used), three wands, a shard
of a mirror, the Marauder's map, a broken Snitch, a letter from his
mother, a baby photo, his Gringotts key and his cloak. As he reached
the door at the other end of the passage Harry put the cloak on and
slipped outside.</p><p class="calibre8">As he passed the
greenhouses Harry noticed that Neville had roped a number of
Gryffindors in to helping him continue to fix them up. Seamus and
Dean were attempting to repair a number of terracotta pots while
Lavender, who was still covered in bandages, was watching Parvati
levitate overturned tables. Dennis Creevey was sitting in the corner
of one greenhouse idly flicking ear muffs back onto a row of hooks in
the wall. He looked drawn and pale with circles under his eyes and
Harry's heart clenched as it was filled with the sorrow of Colin's
loss. Dennis must have come back for the memorial; he would have been
evacuated as a fourth year. Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson, Katie
Bell and Oliver Wood were helping Neville repair the panes of glass
in the roof. Assorted sixth years were repotting plants in a section
of the greenhouse that had already been repaired.</p><p class="calibre8">Well, that
explained the empty Common Room.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry wandered
out onto the grounds and dodging various students, families and
teachers made his way to the tomb by the lake. The immediate area was
deserted, the work to rebuild being carried on in other parts of the
castle grounds. As he walked Harry drew the Elder Wand from the pouch
around his neck stopping short a scant metre or two from the white
tomb. Harry felt a surge of anger as he looked at the devastation
that Voldemort had wrought on the final resting place of his mentor.
He approached the tomb with trepidation, knowing what he would see
inside. It didn't make it any easier to approach Dumbledore's
body, reach out and place the wand back on the chest of the body.</p><p class="calibre8">"Goodbye, sir,"
Harry whispered into the stillness. "Thank you for believing in me
and trusting in me. I hope I never let you down."</p><p class="calibre8">And Harry felt,
rather than heard, a voice whisper on the wind. <em class="calibre9">'You
could never let me down.' </em>Harry
retreated from the tomb, tears glistening in his eyes and cast the
strongest spells and charms he could think of to repair and reseal
the tomb.</p><p class="calibre8">****************</p><p class="calibre8">As Harry sat
hidden in the shadows of a large bush at sunset, gazing across the
lake and skipping stones across the top of the water he felt more at
peace than he had done for hours. He twirled the hawthorn wand in his
hand while he contemplated the events of the last few hours. He
relished the opportunity to sit and think without myriad things to
claim his attention. A voice suddenly broke his quiet contemplation.</p><p class="calibre8">"The whole
castle's looking for you, Potter," Draco Malfoy spoke without
malice. "Weasley and Granger are going mental and his mother's
practically lost it." Harry looked down at the wand in his hand and
mutely held it out to Malfoy who took it hesitantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Weaselette's nearly hysterical," Malfoy continued, "keeps
ranting and raving about losing you. Your whole family's gone nuts,
Potter."</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't have
any family, Malfoy," Harry rasped, his voice croaky from disuse.
"Better go back to your mother before she flips as well."</p><p class="calibre8">"You don't
get it, do you Potter?" Malfoy shook his head. "That family
doesn't care that you don't share their genes. You are one of
them as surely as if you were born in that hovel." Harry growled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Weasel's dad
has gone and organized search parties to scour the castle and told
them he'll not lose another one of his boys," Malfoy continued."
There's frantic redheads everywhere you turn. I don't reckon my
own mother has ever shown as much concern for the fruit of her loins
as that woman is showing for you. Anyone would think she birthed you
herself. If you think you've got no family you are more touched in
the head than Goyle." Malfoy shook his head and turned to walk
away.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
wrong, you know."</p><p class="calibre8">"Come off it
Potter, you must have heard them when they thought you were dead!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, not about
the Weasleys," Harry paused. "About your mother."</p><p class="calibre8">"What would you
know about my mother, Potter?" Malfoy spat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Your mother
betrayed Voldemort for you. He sent her to check that I was dead,"
Harry stood and faced Malfoy. "And she told him I was because when
she asked, I told her you were alive. She knew that the only way to
get into the castle, to get to <em class="calibre9">you</em>,
was to convince Voldemort I was dead so that he'd lead them back
triumphantly and tell them to surrender instead of just destroying
the castle and everyone in it, including you.</p><p class="calibre8">"Tom Riddle
never knew his mother. He never knew his mother loved him so he
didn't understand the depth of a mother's love," Harry had a
sudden thought. "I reckon that's why he and your Auntie Bellatrix
got along so well. She didn't give much thought to a mother's
love either or she never would have taken on Mrs Weasley after trying
to throw a killing curse at her daughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"My mother's
love for me saved me nearly seventeen years ago. Your mother's love
for you helped save you and everyone else two days ago. Don't ever
think she wouldn't lay down her life for you, because she would, in
a heartbeat." And with sudden clarity Harry heard Bill telling him
exactly the same thing.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry noticed the
stars that were beginning to twinkle on the dusky horizon and
remembered Mrs Weasley's fear at their late arrival the night
before. Glancing at his watch he noted the time meant that dinner was
about to get underway in the Great Hall when he noticed some
scratches along one side of the face. He mentally shrugged, oh well
at least they matched the dents on the back.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">-traditional
to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age…it was my brother
Fabian's…it's a bit dented on the back…"</em></p><p class="calibre8">Harry suddenly
took off in the direction of the castle, sprinting towards the great
oak door. As he skidded to a stop at the top of the marble steps,
breathing hard, Harry heard a commotion coming from inside and if he
wasn't mistaken it was being caused by some Weasleys. He pushed the
door open and came face to face with a raised wand.</p><p class="calibre8">Because he was
breathing hard from running Harry managed to hide the fact that his
heart began to thump heavily in his chest and his breathing had
quickened. He stood petrified, staring down the business end of a
wand, unable to move.</p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">What is
happening to me?'</em> he thought wildly,
holding his breath, pulse racing and his eyes fixed on the wand.
Dimly, as if from far away he heard voices calling his name. The wand
moved and Harry breathed. Slowly the rest of the Entrance Hall came
into focus. Hermione was there, peering at him concernedly. Had she
seen him freeze? No, he'd panicked, had she seen that?</p><p class="calibre8">"You people
have <em class="calibre9">got</em>
to stop pointing wands at me," he puffed, pushing down the anxiety
that threatened to overwhelm him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop being a
git then! Where on earth have you been?" retorted Ron. Harry
flinched and shrank back as Ron gave off a very uncanny impression of
his mother, only taller. In fact now that Harry thought about it Ron
seemed about twice as big as he usually did. "We've been looking
for you for hours! You can't just take off like that! How would we
know if something had happened to you? Oh we probably wouldn't,
would we? Not until someone brings your body back!" Bill stepped
forward, putting his hand on Ron's shoulder which seemed to shrink
him back to normal size.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
enough Ron," he said softly. "Harry, are you all right?" Harry
nodded mutely all too aware of his own palpitating fear that seemed
to throb between them like a heartbeat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron's just a
bit worried about where you'd got to. No one is going to hurt you
Harry," Bill murmured. Harry had clearly not managed to fool Bill.
"Mum's a bit frantic but if you come and let her feed you she'll
be right."</p><p class="calibre8">"Could you
check Dumbledore's tomb when you get a chance, please Bill?"
Harry found his voice. "I repaired it and sealed it with the
strongest charms I know but they are still pretty basic. I'm not
sure I know enough about sealing tombs and things." Bill nodded and
Harry took a few deep breaths and fought to control his emotions.
Shoving his hands into his pockets, determined to hide the fact that
they were shaking, Harry looked around to see who else was in the
Entrance Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">It looked as
though Charlie was the one who'd been brandishing a wand as his
still dangled loosely from his hand while he examined Harry
critically. Ron had crossed his arms over his chest and was staring
defiantly at the floor. Hermione was examining Harry with a very
calculating gaze.</p><p class="calibre8">"So what's
been going on here, then?" he asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron had a
slight problem with you running off," said Charlie. "It's been
making him a bit irrational."</p><p class="calibre8">"I think the
events of the past few days are catching up with all of us," came
Mr Weasley's voice from the shadows. Harry started, he hadn't
seen the Weasley patriarch on his first scan of the Entrance Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
Harry said quietly, running a hand through his hair. The shaking had
abated and he was feeling more himself again. "I just needed to get
away. I needed some time to think."</p><p class="calibre8">"Not to worry
Harry, not to worry," Mr Weasley said. "Let's get inside and
let everyone know we found you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I really am
sorry," said Harry again, staring at the top of Ron's head,
willing him to look up. "Things have been making me a bit, er,
jumpy today."</p><p class="calibre8">"Quite all
right Harry, quite all right," said Mr Weasley. "Now how about we
go in and call off the search. If we don't get you in there soon
Molly will be out here and I really don't think we need a repeat of
last night on top of everything else."</p><p class="calibre8">Mr Weasley turned
and led the way into the Great Hall. There was food on the table but
the occupants at one end of the Gryffindor table were not eating it
at all. George was staring idly at the table, gouging a small hole it
in it with the point of a knife. Mrs Weasley was staring at the
fireplace as if waiting for someone to Floo in. Fleur was drumming
her fingers on the table, staring fixedly at the water jug. Ginny had
drawn her knees up and wrapped her arms around them, all of them
ignoring the food Percy was piling onto their plates.</p><p class="calibre8">Ron ambled up to
them, sat heavily in a chair and started piling his own plate high.
His arrival seemed to rouse the other occupants.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did you find
him, Ron," his mother demanded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, he
turned up eventually, yes," Ron said sullenly. Mrs Weasley shrieked
and jumped up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well why
didn't you say so!" she demanded and she hurried around the
table, her eyes seeking Harry's as he stood behind Bill. "Are you
all right? Where have you been? If you keep disappearing like that
you'll give us all heart attacks!" She seized his face, searching
his eyes. Harry fought the urge to pull away. Eventually she released
him and pushed him into the chair next to Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">The tension hung
over them like a thick blanket as they ate. No one spoke, the hum of
other occupants of the room swarmed around them like a low buzz.
Harry pushed his food around his plate and suddenly, unable to stand
it any longer, he cleared his throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry I
ran off this afternoon," he began. "I just needed some time to
think." Ron's hands started shaking and he dropped his knife. He
wouldn't look Harry in the eye. Hermione's eyes darted between
the two of them; she was studying them as if trying to figure out a
giant puzzle.</p><p class="calibre8">"I-I'm fine
now," Harry finished.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well don't
go disappearing again," Ron said quietly. "I can't go through
that again. I was scared for you Harry." He finally looked up at
Harry. There was pain radiating from him. "When you took off I
couldn't help it, I thought you weren't going to come back this
time or that something might happen to you. I got so angry that you
might be gone. I couldn't bear it if you didn't come back."
Hermione sniffed.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's okay,"
said Harry, "I'm not going anywhere. I'm here to stay; you
can't get rid of me you know. You guys are my family."</p><p class="calibre8">"Good," said
Ron and he surreptitiously wiped his face with his sleeve as he said
it. "Now I think it's time for pudding."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry turned to
look at Ginny. She was playing with her food, her face hidden by a
curtain of hair. Harry reached over, putting his hand on hers and he
felt her suddenly turn her hand over and grab his tightly. He left
his hand resting gently in hers for the remainder of the meal.</p>
