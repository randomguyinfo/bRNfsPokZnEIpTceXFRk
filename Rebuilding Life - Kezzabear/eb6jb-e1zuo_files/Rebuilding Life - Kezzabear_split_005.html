			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">5. Rebuilding Hogwarts</strong></p><p class="calibre8">As Harry,
Hermione and the Weasleys made their way to the Great Hall, Harry
noticed that repair work had already commenced on some areas of the
castle. Some of the burnt tapestries had been removed or repaired and
the hallways appeared to have been swept in some parts and rubble
pushed to the side.</p><p class="calibre8">"We've been
cleaning up a bit today," Charlie explained, noticing Harry's
keen gaze. "Even Filch picked up a mop earlier with something
resembling enthusiasm."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah some of
us were drafted," added Ron. "Unlike some I could mention who
were off who knows where, doing who knows what all day, the lazy
sods." Hermione elbowed him sharply in the side and Harry stifled a
laugh.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes well, be
that as it may," said Mrs Weasley, giving Ginny a questioning look,
"Kingsley sent word that he intends to have Hogwarts open again in
September and if we want that we need to get a move on. No one was
able to get into some parts of the castle above the Third Floor to
see how much damage is up there and the Grand Staircase is a mess."</p><p class="calibre8">"Trelawney's
crystal balls didn't do it any favours," chimed George. "Bloody
good shot she is though. Best use I ever saw for the wretched
things." Harry silently agreed with that assessment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville spent
all day in the greenhouses," added Hermione. "Professor Sprout's
been busy in the Hufflepuff Common Room so he volunteered to check on
the plants. I can't wait until we can get through to the Library.
Oh I hope it didn't get too much damage."</p><p class="calibre8">They approached
the Great Hall and Harry saw that it was almost completely dark
outside now; the first stars beginning to twinkle low on the horizon.
The quiet hum emanating from the Great Hall made him slow his feet.
He wasn't sure if he was ready to see all those people. He didn't
know if he had the strength to face them. The Weasleys and Hermione
all went ahead of him. Ron pushed the doors open, muttering something
about unnatural starvation but Harry found himself rooted to the
spot, just outside the Great Hall. Only Ginny noticed he had stopped.
She had been walking with her father and she ducked out from under
his arm and approached Harry. Mr Weasley waited by the doors to the
Great Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are you all
right, Harry?" Ginny asked.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't
think I can go in there," Harry said quietly. He looked at her and
shrugged. "All the people… I don't like being stared at and,
well I… feel a bit silly really. I don't even really know why I
can't go in there." He looked at her hopelessly. Was his
Gryffindor bravery failing him after everything he'd been through,
so much so that he couldn't face a few people eating dinner? Ginny
reached out and took his hand in hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"It'll be
okay, I'll come in with you," she smiled. "Besides, Bill scared
them all off earlier and I think Neville was minutes away from
getting the sword out again and threatening to lop off people's
heads if they didn't give you space."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ready Harry?"
asked Mr Weasley. "If we don't get you in there soon Molly will
have our heads. You know how she gets when you look a bit peaky."
Harry took a deep breath, squeezed Ginny's hand and stepped
forward. The doors creaked open and the three of them slipped
through. Mr Weasley headed straight for the knot of redheads
currently seating themselves at the Gryffindor table where Fleur and
Mrs Tonks were already eating. There was a pram next to them. A few
people looked up at Harry and waved and Luna turned her head the Lion
hat on her head roaring a greeting. Harry briefly wondered where on
earth it had come from and why she was wearing it but mentally
shrugged and figured he'd probably never know the answer, or
understand it if she told him. Harry and Ginny made their way to
their family and Harry pulled out a chair for Ginny next to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop being all
noble and chivalrous and making the rest of us look bad," groused
Ron. Harry and Hermione simultaneously slapped him on the back of the
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut up Ron,"
said Ginny. "Besides, I thought you all agreed not to pick on
Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Wasn't me
who agreed to that," grumbled Ron. "It only starts with pulling
chairs out and opening doors. Soon I'll have to watch all the lovey
dovey rubbish and the snogging. If George wants to defer to Harry's
paltry escaping death feats he's welcome to, me, I'm not putting
up with that sort of behaviour. Blokes get all soppy when they fall
for girls. It's unnatural." He pulled a face.</p><p class="calibre8">"You can't
talk Mr Snogged In Every Corner Of The Common Room!" retorted
Ginny. Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry behind their heads.</p><p class="calibre8">"That was
different!" Ron protested. "That was – that was … your
fault!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh don't
start that with me," Ginny hissed. "I didn't make you do it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I suppose you
are going to tell me snogging Dean in the middle of a public
thoroughfare isn't inappropriate public displays of affection?"
Ron retorted. Dean, hearing his name, looked up. As the look on Ron's
face most closely resembled apoplectic Dean stayed silent, wisely
choosing not to get involved.</p><p class="calibre8">"Inappropriate!
You want inappropriate public displays of affection?" snorted
Harry. He affected a soppy tone, "Oh Hermione, let's not worry
about poor Harry and his little saving the world quest, let's have
a big snog in the middle of a battle … I had to watch that you
know!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Quidditch Cup,
common room!" Ron said without missing a beat. "Even!" Harry
considered that for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay, consider
the subject closed." Harry pulled out his own chair and sat down,
heaping some chicken on his plate. Mrs Weasley studied the four of
them for a moment and shook her head with resignation before turning
back to her plate. Harry began to eat with relish, listening with
half an ear to the conversations around him.</p><p class="calibre8">"- Flitwick
levitating a block of stone bigger than he was, thought he was gunna
drop it on his own head!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I shall seek
an application to the Ministry as soon as possible Father, I did
after all enjoy my work there. I'm not sure my resignation will be
valid anyway mind you, after all-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you reckon
they'll cancel NEWTS? How anyone could sit exams after-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No! I swear
last night I heard a rumbling sound and flashing lights coming from
the Forest. Downright creepy – "</p><p class="calibre8">"-goblins are
missing a dragon-"</p><p class="calibre8">"-waiting for
Kingsley to ask me to help capture it."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey Lee! Did
you ever go back and get those fireworks we hid in the boathouse from
Filch and Umbridge? You reckon they're still there?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Your attention
please!" Professor McGonagall's magically amplified voice rang
out through the Great Hall. "Now that we are all here there are a
few notices which I wish to make you aware of before we tuck into
pudding. The Minister for Magic has sent word that Hogwarts is to
reopen on September first. In the interim I have been appointed to
oversee the rebuilding and administration of the new school year as
Headmistress. There will be special considerations surrounding NEWTS
and opportunities offered for the completion of studies for those
students who were unable to attend this past year." Here she paused
and her gaze rested on Harry, Ron and Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's a
lot to rebuild but if you wish to volunteer to help here at Hogwarts,
please see me," the Professor continued. "You are all welcome to
stay here over the next few days as we prepare for the memorial
service to be held in three days time. The following day, school will
be officially dismissed for the year. I would like to remind the
remaining students that the Forbidden Forest remains forbidden and
don't let me catch you with anything from the list of banned items
that can be found hanging outside Mr Filch's office." She turned
her steely gaze on George.</p><p class="calibre8">"The House Cup
needs awarding and as such I have a few last minute points to award.
Mr Longbottom, I suspect that you and Misters Potter and Weasley and
Ms Granger have no doubt, once again, earned enough points between
you to award the Cup to Gryffindor. I don't think we need to go
into specifics." The Great Hall erupted into cheers as the four
Gryffindors looked sheepishly at each other, reminded of their first
year.</p><p class="calibre8">"Cheer up
Neville!" shouted Ron. "At least Hermione didn't have to knock
you out this time!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No," said
Neville wryly, "being attacked by a flaming hat and nearly knocked
out with a massive sword is so much better than that!" Harry looked
at Neville thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"I reckon
that's not necessarily what earned you points mate. First year it
was for standing up <em class="calibre9">to</em>
your friends. I reckon this year it was definitely for standing up
<em class="calibre9">for</em> your
friends. Thanks Neville," he said. Neville inclined his head in a
gesture that Harry took to mean 'no problem' and the two of them
reached for treacle tart and dug in.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry ignored the
whisperings of the five Weasley brothers as he absently listened to
Hermione talk excitedly with Neville about being able to finish her
magical education.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
how I'll go with a year off and everything," said Hermione. "All
the things you learned last year … I'll be behind and have to
catch up. It is such a disadvantage."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
worry," Neville reassured her. "You couldn't possibly have
missed out on anything this year as I haven't learned much more
than how to dodge Unforgivables." Harry and Hermione winced but
Neville unconcernedly continued eating his treacle tart. Harry pushed
his away. He was only dimly aware of Professor McGonagall stepping
down from the head table and heading his way and of Fleur holding
little Teddy and gushing over his chubby cheeks. He was, however,
fully aware of Ginny's thigh pressed against his, her foot hooked
around his ankle and her shoulder and upper arm brushing against his
as she ate. She was listening to her mother make plans for returning
to Auntie Muriel's to pick up their things before heading to the
Burrow and settling back in. Just as Professor McGonagall reached
their location Bill, Charlie, Ron and George stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come on,"
George was saying. "We don't even have to leave the castle,
there's a secret passage." Mrs Weasley looked up sharply and
Professor McGonagall fixed him with a stare.</p><p class="calibre8">"I do hope, Mr
Weasley, that you are not planning anything nefarious," she said
drily. George fixed his face into a picture of innocence and merely
shrugged as if to say he was incapable of nefarious deeds or indeed
anything less than the most studious and strict intentions. Professor
McGonagall's face softened as she looked at her former student.
"Just don't damage anything, Mr Weasley. We have quite enough to
be fixing as it is."</p><p class="calibre8">With a mock
salute George turned and headed out of the Great Hall, Bill, Charlie
and Ron following him. Percy waited for only a moment before turning
to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"You coming?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Actually Mr
Weasley, I need to speak to Mr Potter," Professor McGonagall said,
"if you can spare me a moment Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Er, sure,
Professor," Harry replied. Ginny jumped to her feet calling to her
brothers to wait for her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll be
back," she grinned wickedly. "But I must know what they are up
to!" She hurried off, Mrs Weasley watching her retreating offspring
worriedly. Mr Weasley patted her arm comfortingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Now, Mr
Potter, Ms Granger," began Professor McGonagall, "there are a few
matters to which we must attend. First of all, as you heard me
announce there will be a memorial service here at Hogwarts in three
days, at which time we will be carving the names of those who gave
their lives onto a monument that Hagrid is currently fashioning.
Loved ones of those who gave their lives have been invited to carve
the names of their dear ones into the monument during the service. We
need someone, Mr Potter, to do Remus Lupin this service."</p><p class="calibre8">Professor
McGonagall paused and looked at Harry sorrowfully. Harry tried to
swallow but there was a lump in his throat and he wished suddenly
that Ginny had not left. Hermione reached over and took his hand and
he grabbed onto her as if he were drowning. Taking a deep breath and
blinking back the tears that suddenly sprang to his eyes he nodded
before looking down at the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thank you,
Harry," said Professor McGonagall, squeezing
his shoulder. "I could not think of anyone better to do this for
him. Secondly, Kingsley Shacklebolt has asked me if I could possibly
find out if you know anything about Gringotts' missing dragon."
She pressed her lips together and Harry could not tell if she was
suppressing a laugh or showing extreme displeasure.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well," said
Harry, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. "I reckon he could
try looking north. Er, Hagrid once told me that dragons like to head
north." He looked at Hermione who was as busy avoiding McGonagall's
gaze as he was.</p><p class="calibre8">"I shall tell
him that, thank you. Now one final thing for now, I presume you also
heard that Hogwarts will be reopening and those who missed attending
this year would have that opportunity this September first,"
Professor McGonagall paused and turned to look at Dean Thomas
pointedly. "I should like to make good my promise to see you become
an Auror, Mr Potter. For this you will need NEWTS and though you are
a truly wonderful a young man, I should think you might need to study
for those. As magnificent as your defensive spells are I think your
charm work could do with a little sprucing up." Professor
McGonagall looked pointedly at his rumpled and rather stained robes
which had not seen a particularly good laundering charm that morning.</p><p class="calibre8">"I would like
to entreat you to return for the next academic year, Mr Potter,"
she continued. "Not the least of which reasons is a desire to see
the Quidditch Cup in Gryffindor one more time under your Captaincy."
She pulled a shiny badge from an inside pocket in her robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can I tempt
you Mr Potter?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry stared at
the badge and what it represented, at what he was being offered.
Ginny's words echoed in his head. Let the adults make the
decisions, he might have turned seventeen and be legally an adult but
this was probably his last chance to reclaim a portion of his lost
childhood. It would be his last chance to roam Hogwarts as his home;
spending evenings in Gryffindor tower and having afternoon tea with
Hagrid. His last chance to explore hidden passageways, captain the
Quidditch team and eat until he was bursting at the Hallowe'en
feast. If he didn't go back to Hogwarts what would he do? Could he
waltz into an Auror position without sitting his NEWTS? Did he want
to even if he could?</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked up
at Hermione who was watching him, her eyes shining. She looked
excited and he knew what she was going to do. Hermione would be here
with him, perhaps they could convince Ron and this; this is where
Ginny would be. He looked at the shiny Gryffindor Captain badge and
reached out a finger to touch it reverently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I haven't
got a broom," he said and then felt rather absurd for saying it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh for
heaven's sake Harry!" burst out Hermione, clearly unable to hold
it in any longer. "We can get you another broom!" Harry, jolted
out of his contemplation, turned to Hermione and smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, I'll
get a broom. I'll be here Professor. I wouldn't miss it for the
world," he said. Hermione squealed and threw her arms around his
neck babbling something about how great it would be and that they had
to go to Diagon Alley and get their books and they should go together
and it would be just like old times, only safe.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll send
your letter on to the Burrow then," Professor McGonagall said and
handed him the badge. "And make sure you get yourself a new
uniform, Potter." Harry looked down at his rather rumpled robes and
grimaced. McGonagall swept away, possibly to persuade more students
to return, or perhaps tell Kingsley where he might begin looking for
his missing dragon.</p>
