			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">27.
Fear</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry flew down to
Hagrid's hut. The grounds were dark; he could see the Forbidden
Forest lurking eerily in the distance and a shiver went through him.
A light in Hagrid's hut guided him to the place where the map
showed Ginny to be. Harry had raised his hand to knock when Hagrid
emerged from the shadows of the Forest, startling him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yer got me note
then?" Hagrid whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," Harry
answered, not quite sure why they were whispering.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know
what Ginny were thinkin'!" rasped Hagrid exasperatedly.
"Wanderin' out in the dark like that and close to the Forbidden
Forest. I know the old danger's past but that Forest is forbidden
for a reason!"</p><p class="calibre8">"She's inside
now, right?" Harry asked. "And why are we whispering?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She told me not
to tell you she were here," Hagrid looked regretfully at Harry as
he gave away his secret. Harry didn't know if it was regret that
Ginny hadn't wanted Harry or regret for breaking the confidence.</p><p class="calibre8">"But you sent
Liberty anyway?" Harry asked, puzzled. He had no idea why Ginny
wouldn't want to see him and it was with great difficulty that he
restrained himself from bursting through the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I come down after
th' feast and were just putterin' about, getting' ready fer
classes termorrer," explained Hagrid. "Sent Crookshanks up ter
Hermione. Dora starts scratchin' the door and Liberty starts
gettin' all fluttery nervous. Right odd behaviour from them two.
They been fine all day.</p><p class="calibre8">"There were th'
softest knock a' me door and Ginny wa' there. Shakin' something
dreadful she were. 'Jus' wanted to see Dora' she says. I told
her she were right reckless and tha' she had bes' get back to
th' castle but she looked at me with them eyes o' hers …"
Harry knew exactly what Hagrid meant. He was unable to resist Ginny
anything if she put her mind and eyes to it.</p><p class="calibre8">" 'Don' send
me away' she says. 'I jus' want ter see Dora.' I told 'er
I'd send fer yer to take 'er back after she saw Dora and she all
but begged me not to," Hagrid continued. "But she were dreadful
pale and shakin' like a leaf so I told 'er I was goin' to check
th' Thestrals and Liberty follered me like she knew I needed 'er.
Right smart bird that." Hagrid looked rather proud as if he was
personally responsible for the brilliance of Harry's owl.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, I reckon
she is," murmured Harry. He pressed a hand to the still closed
door, anxious to see Ginny and hesitant about what he would find when
he opened it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don' tell 'er
I sent fer yer," Hagrid finished in a hoarse whisper. Harry shook
his head as Hagrid melted back into the shadows.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry pushed the
door open slowly. Ginny was huddled in front of a roaring fire,
shivering in spite of the warmth coming from the flames licking the
sides of the fireplace. Dora, with her head on her paws and snoring
softly, was curled up at Ginny's feet.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry considered
Ginny for a moment before closing the door with a soft click. He
knew, even though she didn't move a muscle; that Ginny could tell
he was there. Lately the two of them always knew when the other was
in the room. Harry could often smell Ginny but he had also learned to
distinguish her footsteps from those of others. His physical senses
seemed to seek her out. Harry had noticed recently that he was
starting to turn in her direction when she entered a room and follow
her around like a sunflower following the sun. He didn't mean to do
it and he didn't know how he knew where she was without thinking
about it. At first Harry thought it was something magical; but this
was beyond incantations. It had nothing to do with magic and
everything to do with love.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hey Ginny,"
Harry said as he moved into the room, shedding his robes. The slight
temperature change left him shivering slightly in his shirtsleeves
until he moved closer to the fireplace. "Are you all right?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm fine,"
she said softly. Harry did not believe her. "I told Hagrid not to
send for you."</p><p class="calibre8">"He didn't,"
protested Harry softly. Ginny snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"You are a
terrible liar, Harry Potter."</p><p class="calibre8">"So are you,"
whispered Harry as he reached her and slipped his arms around her
from behind. They sat in silence for a few moments. It was so quiet
that Harry could hear Dora breathing as she slept at Ginny's feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought I was
all right," Ginny said softly after a few moments. "And then
Flitwick brought that Hat out." She stopped and Harry pulled her
closer.</p><p class="calibre8">"What happened?"
he eventually prompted her. Ginny shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't … I
don't really know," she said. "It was like a flashback or
something; like I could see it burning on Neville's head."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah," breathed
Harry. "I saw the same thing."</p><p class="calibre8">"But you were all
right afterwards," said Ginny bitterly. "I was sort of trapped in
my worst nightmare and I couldn't find a way out. I could still see
everything going on around me. I knew where I was." Ginny paused
and snorted softly. "That Dexter and his mates are going to cause
Hermione any number of headaches." Harry chuckled, nodding in
agreement.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, together
with Gilbert … should prove interesting," he said, stroking
Ginny's arm absently. He waited for Ginny to continue, sensing that
her experience on seeing the Hat was entirely different to his own.</p><p class="calibre8">"So I could see
what was happening but I couldn't leave … this place, where I
was," Ginny continued after a long moment. "It's kind of hard
to describe. I knew I was in the Great Hall and it was the
start-of-term Feast. I was even talking to people and I answered you
… sort of. But my head was playing images I couldn't control. It
was just ... death." Ginny trailed off and Harry wondered if she'd
gone back to the place where she'd been.</p><p class="calibre8">He felt helpless. It
had been hard coming back to Hogwarts. Harry had gotten caught up in
the drama with the starting students and then on the platform with
the Thestrals. Then he actually entered the Great Hall which
culminated in the confrontation with Malfoy. Harry had reacclimatised
himself without even realising it. He had slipped easily into silly
banter with Dean and Seamus and even sorting out the first years in
the wake of Dexter's toad hadn't seemed difficult or odd in any
way. Beyond the brief notion that he'd seen the Hat flaming, it had
been like any other school year once he'd stepped off the platform
at Hogsmeade. It almost startled him that Ginny had slipped into some
sort of dark place linked to the battle.</p><p class="calibre8">As he rubbed Ginny's
arm and moved his hand to caress her neck, pulling her hair aside and
bending to kiss her there, Harry realised Ginny's reaction upon
returning to Hogwarts shouldn't have been a surprise. He'd seen
it happen to most of the students as they had arrived and he'd seen
the reaction of Gryffindor House to his altercation with the Fat
Lady. He was roused from his musings when Ginny suddenly began
speaking again.</p><p class="calibre8">"You died, you
know," her tone was almost conversational. "F-Fred was dead. He
died here too. He died and then V-Voldemort said you were dead.
Neville had to hold me back. I was going to strangle that bastard
with my bare hands. Neville grabbed me, he practically held me down;
kept muttering something about a snake." Ginny wasn't shaking
now, she was eerily calm.</p><p class="calibre8">"The Hat … it
was like I was back there," Ginny said staring into the fire. "Like
some bizarre halfway place between then and now. I could see you
lying there just like in all my dreams. I was willing you to wake up.
Just get up and … oh I don't even know. I just wanted you not to
be dead. Neville was holding me back and then, he wasn't anymore
and he was yelling at that … that evil … thing."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny was no longer
in the one-roomed hut or even at the Feast; but in the past, a few
months ago. She paused and looked up as if staring at some unseen
tableau, the players on it acting out a scene she never wanted to
watch. When she spoke again her voice was soft, so faint that Harry
had to strain to hear it.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think George
must have grabbed me then," she said. "Maybe it was Charlie; I
don't really know who it was, except that it wasn't Fred." She
paused, one hand idly scratching Dora's head. The flames crackling
in the grate popped and a log, finally burned through, sent up a
shower of sparks as it collapsed.</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville said
something I think. I didn't know where he went. All I could see was
you," Ginny went on, the dimming fire casting a reddish glow over
her. "All I could feel was my heart breaking; shattering into a
million tiny, tiny pieces."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry buried his
face in her hair as he felt her sorrow. It was tangible, swirling
about the room, weaving it's tendrils about them. He breathed in
her scent, remembering how she'd told him, all those weeks ago,
that she'd felt such despair when Hagrid had carried his lifeless
body out of the Forest. Then he had been concerned only with his own
sorrows and had welcomed Ginny's soft arms and sweet kisses which
had <em class="calibre9">Obliviated</em> his mind for a time.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny had expressed
her thoughts; of course she had been sad, but Harry had heard that
and accepted it without question. Her brother had just died and he
had been sensitive to that. That she has sunk to despair at his
apparent passing had served only to feed Harry's ego. Of course she
had sorrowed over him and, it had felt grand. That such a girl loved
him so much that she had mourned so deeply made him feel ten feet
tall and he had kissed her to make her forget; to prove they were
both still alive.</p><p class="calibre8">It physically hurt
to realise that he had not allowed her to really express herself or
acknowledged the real depth of her feelings. As Harry tightened his
grip on Ginny he let his tears fall silently into her hair. She
poured out her sorrow as Harry listened and realised, truly realised
for the first time that while that last final, horrible battle had
signalled for him, along with the trauma associated with battle and
war; a beginning, a fresh start, the beginning of his life. For Ginny
it had embodied all of her worst fears, every dread in her heart.</p><p class="calibre8">"It was straight
from my nightmares," Ginny continued as she reached up to wipe away
the tears from her own cheeks. "Fred was gone. You were … dead. I
wasn't ever going to be whole again.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">He</em> was so
arrogant, strutting around like that but I didn't even care. I
didn't care about any of it, because nothing mattered anymore.
There was a lump of ice in my chest where my heart used to be. I was
numb. Just numb; and George … or Charlie, didn't have to hold me
back anymore because I didn't want to fight anymore."</p><p class="calibre8">Coming back to
Hogwarts had been easy for Harry. He'd missed it last year and he'd
come to see McGonagall a few weeks earlier, able to drink in the
repaired splendour of the castle. He'd been through some of his
worst moments at Hogwarts and still the old castle reached out to
him. It called to him as no other place had. For now Hogwarts was his
home, his life, his refuge, but he knew it wouldn't last. Already
he found himself drawn to other places. An underlying need to go to
Grimmauld Place was easily pushed aside, rationalised and ignored but
The Burrow was reaching out to him with tentative fingers. It
brushed against the edges of his conscience, telling him he belonged.
Harry didn't think it was actually The Burrow most of the time
because the fingers felt like one of Ginny's caresses and he knew
it was her that was calling him and one day the building wouldn't
matter. Home would be wherever Ginny was.</p><p class="calibre8">But for Ginny who
had always had a happy home and been surrounded by family who loved
her, Hogwarts held none of the sanctuary Harry found there. The
cracks that formed in Hogwarts' shiny exterior in her first year
had been patched, their crevices covered until the places where they
had been were dimmed and almost forgotten. Now they had been split
open again, now it was the place she'd had to give up the greatest
desire of her heart and bravely face that the man she loved, for
Harry knew now that she always had; was to leave her. Harry never
felt so low for breaking up with her at Dumbledore's funeral than
he did now.</p><p class="calibre8">Then, she'd gone
back there, alone, to face Death Eaters and mount a defence against
the increasingly strong evils that permeated their world. Last year
Hogwarts had been a place that separated her from the man she loved
and her family, her haven. And finally it was the place of her
deepest fears, her worst nightmares. Her brother had died here, she'd
wept over his battered body in the same Great Hall in which they'd
been feasting. And then her already battered and beaten heart had
taken a final shattering blow when Harry had been carried from the
Forest. Ginny didn't give up or cry easily; but it was no wonder
that she hadn't wanted to fight anymore.</p><p class="calibre8">"I think when
Neville stood up and refused to back down it … got through to me,"
Ginny continued, her voice strengthening slightly, although she
shivered in the cool hut. The fire had died down and, not wanting to
let her go, Harry pulled a huge, Hagrid sized blanket from a nearby
chair and wrapped it around them both. He didn't know what time it
was but he didn't care. The blanket pooled on the floor at their
feet, the folds of the coarse wool lumpy against the smooth floor of
Hagrid's hut.</p><p class="calibre8">"I told him before
I … left, that he would have to finish it," Harry said when Ginny
did not continue. Ginny was silent for a moment after he spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"You knew," she
said eventually, turning to face him. It wasn't a revelation; she
had known since the earliest days after that battle. "You knew you
weren't coming back when you passed me on the lawn."Harry drew in
a deep breath. She'd sensed him. He'd known it then but hoped
that she had not, that it had been a coincidence that she had turned
at his passing that night. Harry nodded slowly but there was no
reproach in her eyes as they searched his.</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't know
it was you then," said Ginny as her small fingers played with the
buttons on his shirt. She was staring at some point over his left
shoulder, kneeling between his thighs as she moved imperceptibly
closer to him.</p><p class="calibre8">"But later you
did?" Harry asked softly, his breath catching in his throat. Ginny
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"When Hagrid said
you'd gone," she said. "You'd been on the ground and then
Neville … and then there was fighting … and you had just gone,
vanished. I felt you and I didn't even think it meant you were
alive. I don't think I even felt anything. I could just … feel
you and it felt like I could do anything then."</p><p class="calibre8">"Is that why you
took on Bellatrix?" asked Harry, closing his eyes and trying to
ignore the warmth that was spreading through his chest as Ginny's
fingertips loosened a button and made contact with his skin.</p><p class="calibre8">"I don't know if
it was that or if I felt like I had nothing left to lose," admitted
Ginny. Harry looked up at her. Ginny was looking down and Harry's
hands were holding the blanket around their shoulders, preventing him
from lifting her head with a caress.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
was all he whispered. Ginny's fingers continued to play across his
chest, causing his breath to hitch as she traced the scar over his
heart and trailed over the place where the Killing Curse had struck
him that night.</p><p class="calibre8">"I could feel
you," Ginny whispered. "I could still feel you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I didn't stop
because," Harry swallowed, "because I couldn't have kept going
if I did. The last thing I thought of was you." Ginny raised her
head then.</p><p class="calibre8">She moved closer to
him, her hands sliding around his back. Harry's eyes slid shut as
Ginny placed her lips gently over his own. Her kiss was chaste and
brief, over too soon. Harry's eyes fluttered open. Unable to speak
his eyes searched hers, asking why she stopped.</p><p class="calibre8">The coarse, scratchy
wool of Hagrid's blanket rasped across the back of his hands and
the small of his back where Ginny's hands had pulled the shirttails
out of his trousers and explored his waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"I wouldn't have
let you go," Ginny whispered as he hands slid up his arms. Harry
didn't know when Ginny had completely unbuttoned his shirt but he
knew she must have because he felt her hair tickling his chest and
stomach as she bent to kiss the scar over his chest. Her voice was
barely a whisper. "I had already lost Fred. I would not have lost
you too.</p><p class="calibre8">"And then I did
anyway. This place … it's filled with loss. I just … I was just
remembering. Trapped in that other place and McGonagall was talking
about – about banned things …" She trailed off and Harry pulled
her closer as she looked up at him, her hands still resting on his
shoulders. Her eyes stared into his, filled with pain.</p><p class="calibre8">"And then someone
said Weasley," finished Harry, dropping the blanket and running his
hands up her back. "And they were talking about the twins." Ginny
nodded as she buried her face in his shoulder.</p><p class="calibre8">"I couldn't be
there anymore," she murmured. "There were too many memories and
they were pressing in on me." Harry turned his head to press a kiss
to her hair as she shivered and he reached to wrap the blanket around
them both again.</p><p class="calibre8">"I was worried,"
he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
whispered Ginny.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't be."</p><p class="calibre8">"I felt silly,"
Ginny sighed, shifting a little and settling back on her bottom,
draping her legs over Harry's. "I didn't want you to have to
deal with me and my silly fears and memories. You've got enough to
be worrying about with yourself."</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't ever
think that," said Harry fiercely. "Your fears and memories <em class="calibre9">are</em>
my worry. If you are afraid, or worried, or scared, that's my
biggest worry, no matter what else is going on. I fought an entire
war so that I can have the privilege of worrying about you." Ginny
looked at Harry solemnly.</p><p class="calibre8">"And to hope with
you," Harry added softly, tucking a stand of hair behind her ear
and caressing her face. "Dream with you, be with you. I want to be
with you Ginny, always. I want to share your worries and your fears."
Ginny's hands slid up his chest, pushing his shirt from his
shoulders and down his arms. Her small fingers raked their way across
his shoulders under the scratchy blanket.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, Harry
Potter," she said slyly, a hint of mischief in her voice. "Your
shoulders do seem broader than they once were. Do you think they are
strong enough to bear my burdens as well as your own?" Harry looked
at her seriously.</p><p class="calibre8">"Let me," he
pleased. "Please don't shield me." Ginny nodded her head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay," she said
softly. "I think maybe I could face almost anything with you."</p><p class="calibre8">She kissed him then,
finishing the promise she had started minutes ago with that brief,
chaste kiss. This kiss was anything but chaste. Her lips played
forcefully over his own and her tongue stroked insistently at his
lips until he parted them and it tangled with his own as his fingers
tangled in her hair. Harry pressed her to the ground, trapping the
blanket under them as they lay there exploring with tongues and
fingertips. Ginny's nimble fingers pushed insistently at Harry's
shirt until he wriggled out of it completely, discarding it somewhere
on Hagrid's floor.</p><p class="calibre8">**********************</p><p class="calibre8">Harry couldn't
feel his legs. As he struggled his way to consciousness from the
depths of sleep he realised it was not sinister that he was unable to
feel his lower limbs. Something that was obviously hair tickled his
nose and a small hand rested on his bare chest. The owner of the hair
and hand was pinning down his left leg and a warm fuzzy lump was
weighing down his right. He was not surprised to find his left hand
resting on a soft curve. Ginny's breath ghosted across his neck.
The fire was now just glowing coals in the grate and his right foot
was beginning to tingle. The sky outside the window was still dark,
twinkling with numberless stars. Harry heard a loud snore from the
corner of the one roomed hut and a sort of wet snuffling sound from
nearby.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny!" he
hissed urgently, "Ginny, wake up!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, go 'way,"
she mumbled into his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wake <em class="calibre9">up</em>!"
Harry insisted, trying to shrug off the blanket in which they were
cocooned. "We are so dead!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, no one's
died," murmured Ginny, burrowing further into the massive blanket.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid's in
here!" Harry poked Ginny sharply in the ribs as Hagrid punctuated
his words with a rumbling snore. Ginny's eyes shot open and she sat
up abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's the
time?" she whispered frantically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, it's still
dark," Harry whispered back. Ginny grabbed his wrist and checked
his watch in the semi dark.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's four in
the morning!" she moaned. "We fell asleep!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, you think?"
asked Harry sarcastically, pushing Dora off his leg and scrambling
out of the blanket.</p><p class="calibre8">"We need to get
back," said Ginny, scrabbling around in the blanket for her robes
which Harry knew were tangled somewhere in the blanket. "Before
they know we're not there."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh," said Harry
grimly. "I think Hermione and Neville will be aware of that."
Ginny looked stricken. Harry smiled at her and pulled his
Invisibility Cloak out. A slow grin spread across Ginny's features
as Harry swirled the cloak around them both and, saying a whispered
goodbye to Dora they stole out of Hagrid's hut, one of his snores
covering the loud click of the door as they stepped out into the
darkness.</p><p class="calibre8">The trip to
Gryffindor Tower was uneventful; Harry and Ginny didn't even run
into Mrs Norris. It wasn't until they stood in front of the Fat
Lady that they ran into difficulties. She was snoozing softly in her
frame, her painted headdress looking as though it would fall down
over her face at any moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"I got cross at
her before," Harry whispered under the cloak. "She might not let
me in and she'll definitely be angry if I wake her." Ginny
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, you'll
have to tell me! I don't know the password," she hissed
eventually.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry Potter,"
came a stern voice from behind them. Harry felt Ginny freeze as he
stiffened. Professor McGonagall swept past, missing them by inches as
the Fat Lady woke with a start and swung open sleepily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don' know what
you're playin' at," she grumbled. "In and out like a train
station all night." The portrait swung shut behind the professor
and Ginny turned to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"I thought she saw
us!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No, that's the
password," Harry grimaced. Ginny smirked and Harry rolled his eyes
at her. "Well we can't go in now. What are we going to do?"
Before Ginny could answer the portrait swung open again and Hermione
and Neville came scrambling out. To Harry's surprise, Ron was
behind them.</p><p class="calibre8">"What do you mean
you didn't know, Hermione?" he was saying. "I thought you knew
everything about Hogwarts?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well obviously
not, Ron," snapped Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"It should have
been obvious," murmured Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Quite, Mr
Longbottom," said Professor McGonagall crisply from behind them
all. "The staff of Hogwarts does not take kindly to intruders. Such
measures were put into place by Professor Snape a year ago."</p><p class="calibre8">"Bit late by then
wasn't it?" muttered Ron grimly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mr Weasley,"
said Professor McGonagall sharply. "You are skating on extremely
thin ice. I suggest you do not push your luck. Follow me, all of you.
I also want to know what you two were doing out of bed at this hour
of the night." She indicated Hermione and Neville as she spoke and
turned in the direction of the Headmistresses office. Ron, Hermione
and Neville began to follow her. Harry held his breath as the four of
them approached. He had no idea what Ron was doing at Hogwarts or how
he got into Gryffindor Tower but to find out meant following them.
Harry was fairly sure discovery outside his common room at four in
the morning, even for the Head Boy, would be frowned upon.</p><p class="calibre8">He and Ginny stood
as still as statues as Professor McGonagall swept past followed by
their three friends. Suddenly Ron stopped. Glancing quickly at
Professor McGonagall, he tilted his head to where Harry and Ginny
were standing.</p><p class="calibre8">"You two are going
to pay for this," he whispered. "Get inside <em class="calibre9">right now</em>.
I'll talk to you later, Harry." Ron and Hermione both hastened
after Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"How did he …"
Ginny trailed off and Harry shook his head. He stared after Ron and
Hermione as they rounded the corner, Ron giving one last jerk with
his thumb before disappearing from view.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry Potter,"
Ginny hissed at the Fat Lady who only grunted sleepily and swung
open. The two of them clambered through the portrait hole and pulled
the cloak off. Ginny headed straight for the stairs to the girls'
dorms but Harry caught her hand. Ginny turned to him questioningly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I love you,"
Harry said and he kissed her softly. Ginny blushed a little and gave
him a smile before she squeezed his hand and pulling away, stepped
lightly up the staircase.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry hurried up the
stairs to his room where Seamus and Dean slumbered. Storing his cloak
in his trunk he hastily donned his pyjamas and fell into bed. He was
asleep in minutes.</p><p class="calibre8">*********************</p><p class="calibre8">When Harry woke the
next morning the sun was shining weakly through the windows of his
dormitory. He squinted at his surroundings before feeling for his
glasses and looking around. The room was empty; Neville's
four-poster looked untouched as though he had not slept there. Dean's
bed was a mess of sheets and blankets, a set of robes crumpled on the
pillow. A large book was sighing intermittently from Seamus's
nightstand.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry's eyes
drifted to the bed where Ron usually slept. A tie was looped around
one post and a Puddlemere United poster was spellotaped above the
bed. As he swung his protesting legs out of bed Harry wondered who
was sleeping there. An extra bed has been squeezed in between Neville
and Dean and the trunk at the end of that one said FRJ printed on it
in garish orange paint. The dorm should have looked cramped with the
extra bed in there but it didn't seem to be. Harry crossed the room
to visit the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably
magically expanded," he muttered to the deserted bathroom. When he
had finished Harry wandered back to the deserted dorm, stretching as
he went. He was stiff from falling asleep on Hagrid's floor. He
recalled how Ginny had looked in the firelight and smiled dreamily as
he checked his watch.</p><p class="calibre8">It was after half
past eight.</p><p class="calibre8">With a muttered oath
he scrambled to find his robes, muttering a charm to remove the
creases. Harry pawed frantically through his trunk for clean socks,
searched under his bed for his errant tie as he was trying to do up
his fly and shoved his feet into his shoes as he shrugged himself
into a clean shirt. Harry paused in front of the mirror, scowled at
his hair and then, ignoring it, he slammed out of the dorm and
thundered down the stairs and across the deserted common room.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry took every
secret passage and hidden stairway he knew to get down to the Great
Hall but he was still out of breath when he got there. He pushed the
doors open slowly and shuffled inside quietly. He could see the
teachers handing out class schedules and his eyes went automatically
to the Gryffindor table where he was surprised to see the motherly
woman he'd seen the night before handing out timetables to the
first years.</p><p class="calibre8">There was a spare
seat next to Ginny and Harry smiled to himself as he made a beeline
for her. He was halfway to the seat when he realised Ron was sitting
opposite her, next to Hermione, and laughing with Dean and Seamus.
Dropping into the spare seat he pressed a kiss to Ginny's cheek.</p><p class="calibre8">"Morning," he
murmured before shooting a glance at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good morning
sleeping beauty," Ron grinned at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"What're you
doing here?" Harry blurted. Ron shrugged.</p><p class="calibre8">"By the time
McGonagall finished with me it was practically breakfast time," he
said through a mouthful of eggs. "She said I may as well stay and
have breakfast and see the girl I came to see."</p><p class="calibre8">"But didn't you
see Hermione last night?" asked Harry in a low voice as he piled
his plate with bacon.</p><p class="calibre8">"I came to see
Ginny," Ron said quietly.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry looked up
startled at the tone in Ron's voice. He sounded distinctly
unfriendly. Harry gazed at Ron, perplexed, but Ron wasn't looking
at him, he was shooting daggers at Ginny who was staring back at him
defiantly. Harry flicked a questioning look at Hermione but she was
studiously avoiding his gaze, staring at her plate. Seamus continued
his raucous story about six of his cousins, four trees and a goat
while Harry checked Neville and Dean for any explanation of Ron's
attitude. Dean shook his head and Neville shrugged. Harry opened his
mouth to demand an explanation when someone else spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"Right, who do we
have here then, seventh years? You look like seventh years, I must
say. Seventh years … seventh years … I've got your timetables
here somewhere. I do declare I am quite the dither this morning and I
daresay you all know better than I how this works. I haven't been
back here in so long, quite forgotten how it all works!" The
motherly looking witch was shuffling through an armful of parchment
as she spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's looking
rather spiffing though isn't it? Nice and shiny. I think these are
new tables actually. It never looked so good when I was here you
know. We etched our names into the tables and so on, as children do
you know. I remember I was quit taken with this one boy …" she
trailed off as if lost somewhere in the past. Harry exchanged an
amused look with Seamus.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry, but
do you have our timetables?" asked Hermione before the woman could
begin reminiscing further.</p><p class="calibre8">"What?" the
witch started, her midnight blue hat wobbling as she looked up at
Hermione. "Oh! Oh of course dear, I don't know where my mind was
at. Not at all sure what I was thinking for a moment there. Not a
terribly good way to make a first impression is it? Never mind I'm
sure we'll have quite a bit of time to get to know one another."
She pulled a parchment out with a flourish and squinted at it
thoughtfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginevra?" she
asked, waving the parchment briskly and then handed it to Ginny when
she timidly raised her hand. "Here you are dear. Quite the packed
timetable I see. Still, I'm sure you'll do just fine." The
witch continued to pull pieces of parchment randomly from her pile
and hand them out to the students.</p><p class="calibre8">"Muggle Studies?"
frowned Ginny, scanning her timetable. "I don't do Muggle
Studies."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh!" The witch
stopped abruptly, several pieces of parchment floating to the floor.
She drew her brows together and peered at Ginny; her head tilted.
Harry was starting to wonder if the woman needed glasses. "You must
be a pureblood or a half-blood then dear. Everyone has to do Muggle
Studies except for the Muggleborns."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why?" asked
Dean as he picked up his timetable and looked at it carefully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well, to combat
the absolute rubbish you all learnt last year of course!" She
suddenly looked quite commanding. The pudgy, breathless woman had
been replaced with a strict disciplinarian who managed to sustain an
aura of calm serenity. "Classes are a bit crowded mind, so
Muggleborns aren't in the classes. They know all about the Muggle
world of course, having grown up there so there's not room for
them. We do the best we can." She beamed at Dean and then waved a
piece of parchment in the air, turning back into the motherly figure
in the blink of an eye.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do we have a
Hermione Granger?" she paused, squinting slightly as Hermione took
the parchment eagerly. "Now, I have seen you before dear, I just
know it. Oh I'm sure it will come to me."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sorry,"
interrupted Neville. "I didn't catch your name."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh of course
dear, such a lot to take in isn't it. I'm Ethel Crockwell,
Minerva's asked me to be the Gryffindor Head of House, isn't that
exciting? We shall get along famously I am sure. I was in Gryffindor
of course you know, in my day."</p><p class="calibre8">Ethel suddenly
dropped the pile of parchment she was still carrying and Neville and
Harry dived to the floor to gather them up for her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Professor
Crockwell, would you like some help?" Hermione offered. The
professor looked at her with gratitude etched on her features and
handed her a pile of parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, would you?
And I don't suppose you've seen the Quidditch Captain have you
dear? I have a message for him somewhere ..." she trailed off,
patting her pockets absently and dropping the rest of her papers.
Harry tried hard to stifle his laughter. This woman was a slightly
dotty cross between Trelawney and Mrs Weasley but he was quite
amused. Neville sighed as more parchment rained down on his head and
began gathering them to add to the pile already in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's me,"
Harry eventually managed to say, just as Professor Crockwell pulled a
rolled parchment from one of her pockets.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wonderful,
wonderful," muttered the professor absently as she handed him the
scroll and took the stack of parchment Neville offered her. "Need
to organise try outs and things. I don't know anything about
Quidditch you know, never played it myself. Where's Neville
Longbottom?"</p><p class="calibre8">Neville held out his
hand with a smile and Professor Crockwell handed him a parchment and
Professor Crockwell wandered off muttering about her days at Hogwarts
and calling names randomly from the teetering and crumpled pile of
parchment in her arms. Hermione handed Harry his timetable and
continued down the table handing out timetables to the other
students. Harry looked at his timetable. Ron continued eating his
eggs, quite unmoved by the ruckus caused by the new professor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do you suppose
she's the Muggle Studies teacher then?" asked Ginny, still
frowning at her timetable.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah, she is.
McGonagall announced that at the Feast last night," Seamus said as
he poured himself some pumpkin juice.</p><p class="calibre8">"We've got new
Transfiguration and Defence teachers too," added Dean. "</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh, I um, missed
that part," Ginny muttered sheepishly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes, you did,"
growled Ron menacingly. Harry stared at Ron who had resumed glaring
at Ginny. He once again opened his mouth to find out what was going
on when a small voice came from behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Um, Mr Potter?"
it said timidly. Seamus and Dean snorted and Neville let out a
chuckle. Harry turned around to find Gilbert standing there, twisting
his hands nervously and shuffling from one foot to the other.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's just
Harry," he said, smiling, hoping to reassure the timid boy. Gilbert
opened and closed his mouth several times and turned a brilliant
shade of red. Harry sighed. Gilbert had been able to talk to him fine
before he knew who he was. He had no idea how to put the child at
ease. He was rescued from his dilemma by Dexter who came bounding up
to them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't worry
about that big git," he said, bouncing on his toes, Bartholomew
swinging from one hand. "Just ignore him, he's an awful sourpuss.
"</p><p class="calibre8">"But he's my
brother," wailed Gilbert suddenly, turning to Dexter. "And he's
supposed to help me and he is just ignoring me and I don't know
anybody else! The only person I even met here who's older than me
is Mr Potter and, well he's <em class="calibre9">Harry Potter</em> isn't he? Gerald
is supposed to take care of me!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm sure he
doesn't mean to ignore you," interjected Ginny. She smiled at
Gilbert encouragingly. "Big brothers just get crazy sometimes."
Her words were charged but Harry didn't know exactly why. He could
practically feel Ron stiffen behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I need to send a
letter to mum," whispered Gilbert, gazing at Harry. "Gerald won't
give me any parchment and mine got all wet because I was carrying it
in my pocket and I sort of got too close to the lake but it's
drying now, so it'll be all right in the end but I can't write on
it yet though and all I've got is a pot of green ink, I've lost
my blue ink and I think I left my Transfiguration book at home and so
I need to ask mum to send it to me but Gerald told me not to bother
her because it's my own fault I left the book at home and he won't
give me any parchment and now he's ignoring me and he wouldn't
let me write on the bottom of his letter and then he went to find an
owl without me and I think he's sulking because he thought you
weren't really real you know and he is probably embarrassed I know
that now but I just don't even know what I can write on and how to
get an owl because I was supposed to send my letter with Gerald and
he told me last night me he would get the owl this morning for our
letters and I didn't need to worry about it and-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Whoa, whoa,
whoa," Harry held up his hand. Gilbert had not taken a breath. The
boy stopped short breathing heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"And I didn't
know who else to ask," Gilbert finished, looking down.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's okay,"
said Harry, smiling at the boy and winking at Dexter. "It's
exactly the sort of thing you can bring to the Head Boy. Of course
Hermione's more likely to have parchment and ink but why don't we
write your mum a letter and take a walk to the Owlery before
classes?" Gilbert brightened and looked up at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Really? Gerald
said I was an idiot for bothering you with it. He said you wouldn't
care about me at all and I would just be in the way," Gilbert said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Lots of people
misjudge Harry like that," muttered Ginny. Her words were loaded
with double meaning, Harry could tell, but he gave up trying to
figure out what message Ginny was trying to send Ron and turned to
Neville.</p><p class="calibre8">"Got any ink and a
bit of parchment?" Neville scrabbled about in his bag for a moment
before Luna appeared, or possibly floated up to them, and handed
Gilbert a piece of parchment and a self inking quill.</p><p class="calibre8">"Here you are,"
she said. Gilbert stammered a thanks and Dexter offered him his back
to write on while Luna floated over to Neville and sat boldly on his
lap. Neville began blushing hard enough to rival a Weasley and Seamus
and Dean snickered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good morning
Ronald," Luna said dreamily. "I did not think you were coming to
Hogwarts this year. Hermione seemed very distraught about it all you
know. You really should go and put your school robes on. Not that
those aren't lovely but I didn't think Professor McGonagall would
allow magenta robes in classes."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh well these are
my work robes. I didn't have a chance to get changed and I'm not
staying," Ron protested. He turned to look at Ginny with a hard
glint in his eyes. "I just came to sort someone out." Luna pecked
Neville on the cheek and stood up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well I need to
get to History of Magic and get the seat closest to the
Nurgarblefligs before anyone else sits there. Do go easy on Ginny,
won't you Ronald," she said as she drifted away. "Last year
wasn't a picnic for any of us." Ron glared at her as she walked
away. Ginny looked smug. Harry had no idea what was going on but he
was going to find out right now. He started to open his mouth.</p><p class="calibre8">"I finished the
letter," piped up Gilbert. "Can we go to the Owlery before class
Mr Potter?" Harry sighed and turned away from Ron. He was surprised
neither Ron nor Ginny were dead; the looks they were giving each
other could surely kill. Harry plastered a smile on his face.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure Gilbert,
maybe we can find our owl. She doesn't get a lot of post to
deliver," he said as he squeezed Ginny's shoulder. "I'll see
you in Potions." Ginny smiled up at him and he felt quite warm as
he basked in her beaming smile.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure, Harry, I'll
see if I can save you a seat," she said mischievously. Harry looked
at Ron, trying to convey that he wanted a word with him, as Gilbert
tugged on his sleeve. Ron just looked away.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll see you
later Ron," was all he said and turned to follow Gilbert who had
brightened considerably and was practically bouncing out of the Great
Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"What sort of owl
do you have Mr Potter? I always liked owls you know, they seem very
wise. Even before I knew they carried post you know I always liked
them. I bet your owl is special just like you. I can't wait to meet
him. Is it a him? Maybe you've got a girl owl. She's probably a
grand bird. How long have you had her? Is it a her? Maybe you can't
tell with owls …" Harry let the boy keep talking as they left
ignoring Seamus and Dean calling out '<em class="calibre9">Goodbye Mr Potter!</em>'
and almost all the Ravenclaws who were staring at Gilbert and his
monologue in what could only be described as horror.</p><p class="calibre8">Gilbert chattered
all the way to the Owlery. He seemed to move effortlessly from a
discourse on owls (Gilbert wanted an owl, probably a black one), to a
recount of his trip across the lake the night before (he'd almost
toppled out of his boat and it was probably a miracle he was still
alive). Arriving at the Owlery it didn't take any time at all to
locate Liberty as she swooped down and landed on Harry's shoulder
almost immediately, nipping him on the ear. Gilbert was utterly
enamoured with the snowy owl and fussed over her extensively while
Harry tied the letter to her leg. Before she flew off Liberty pecked
Harry lightly on the hand as if to ask him why he never fussed over
her like that. Harry felt vaguely guilty as the owl flew off but he
pushed the feeling aside as he tried to focus on Gilbert's new
monologue.</p><p class="calibre8">All the way back to
the castle Gilbert treated Harry to his opinion of the castle in the
daylight (it was the largest building he had ever seen), which led to
a summary of his trip to London three years before where he'd seen
many large buildings and Gerald hadn't had a very good time because
they'd run into three ghosts in the Tower of London.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're not used
to ghosts but dad -" here the boy faltered. "Dad told us it was
okay. I really liked them. I'm not sure Gerald likes being a
wizard, you know. He didn't want to come to Hogwarts but mum told
me that dad would want this." Gilbert paused and stopped walking
for a moment. "She loves my dad. I think she misses him heaps.
She's pretty sure he's dead. She didn't say that to us, but she
thinks it. I can tell.</p><p class="calibre8">"Gerald got cranky
cause he has to do Muggle Studies y'know. He thinks he knows all
about Muggles but I bet he doesn't. Mum's a Muggle but we did
lots of wizard stuff too. Dad charmed lots of the kitchen things and
since he's been gone Auntie Gloria comes over and makes sure the
charms are still working. Mum doesn't have to wash the dishes. She
hates washing dishes." Gilbert took a breath and climbed the steps
to the Entrance Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">"But Gerald has to
do Muggle Studies anyway, that teacher told him so. Says we're
half-blood so we have to. She was saying normally I wouldn't be
doing it until third year but those Ministry people made up so many
lies that we need the truth. One of the girls is Muggleborn and she
got cross 'cause she can't do it. I don't know why you'd want
to if you've grown up with Muggles. I mean wouldn't you already
know heaps about Muggles? You'd know the truth wouldn't you and
you wouldn't believe any lies. Oh! I've got to go to
Transfiguration! Thanks Mr Potter!" Gilbert dashed off, calling out
to a group of first years who were heading out of the Entrance Hall.</p><p class="calibre8">As Harry watched
Gilbert go he pondered what the boy had said. He couldn't put his
finger on it, but something the boy said was niggling at him. His
musings were interrupted by raised voices just outside the Entrance
Hall on the Grand Staircase. As he came around the last corner onto
the staircase he could see who it was.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron, just let it
go," pleaded Neville. Harry rounded the corner to see Neville
standing, arms outstretched, between Ron and Ginny as if keeping them
from pulling their wands on each other. Hermione had a restraining
hand on Ron's arm and Dean was actually holding Ginny back.</p><p class="calibre8">"No, it's not
good enough," insisted Ron. "You can't keep doing this!" If
Ron had been about to say something else it was impossible to tell
because at that moment Slughorn's voice boomed genially through the
corridor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good morning,
good morning seventh years! Let's go to Potions!" The man seemed
entirely oblivious to the battle erupting on the Grand Staircase.
Ginny shook Dean off and glared at Ron icily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry Ron," she
spat sarcastically. "I have to go now. Terribly sorry I can't
stay and listen to your <em class="calibre9">concerns</em>. I've somewhere to be."</p><p class="calibre8">"This is not over,
Ginny," Ron called out as she swept past him and down towards the
dungeons. "Don't think I've finished."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ron, just drop
it," pleaded Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"What on earth-"
began Harry but he got no further because Slughorn waddled over to
him, beaming and clapping his hands together once, loudly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry! Harry, my
boy. How wonderful to see you!" he boomed. "It's such a
pleasure and an honour to have you in our class. Now, Harry, dear
boy, allow me to impress upon you the importance of your dedication
in this class." Harry tuned out Slughorn's waffle about Aurors,
Potions results and protection of the people and turned to Ron but
his best mate was rapidly vanishing up the Grand Staircase. The rest
of his classmates melted away to their first class and Slughorn slung
an arm around Harry's shoulders while he was distracted. They made
their way down to the dungeons and into the Potions classroom,
Slughorn droning the whole time about how valuable his Potions
classes were going to be.</p><p class="calibre8">Slughorn dragged
Harry all the way to the front of the class before loosening his grip
and slapping Harry on the back, sent him on his way. The rest of the
class had filed in behind them and Harry sighed heavily. Hermione had
sat down next to Ginny, the two of them whispering furiously. There
was a mix of people from his year and from Ginny's and the only
seat free was next to Draco Malfoy.</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione looked at
Harry apologetically but he just glowered at her as he made his way
to the spare seat. He was increasingly frustrated with the evident
disagreement between Ron and Ginny and his own inability to find out
what the problem was, let alone help resolve it. He sat heavily in
his seat and gazed at Ginny who had her head down and was scribbling
furiously on a piece of parchment. He sighed loudly and realised he
didn't have his bag with him, or his books, or his Potions
equipment.</p><p class="calibre8">It was turning out
to be a very bad day.</p>
