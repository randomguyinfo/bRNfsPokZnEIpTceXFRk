<h2 class="chapterffdl" id="calibre_toc_25">*Chapter 24*: Chapter 24</h2>
			<p class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre4">24. Fame</strong></p><p class="calibre8">Harry
stumbled out of the kitchen fireplace, cursing the invention and
trying not to fall flat on his face. To his surprise, there was no
one in the kitchen, and with a sinking heart, he realised that he
couldn't expect Molly to be in there. He was about to head up the
stairs when raised voices from the living room caught his attention.
He paused in the hallway, recognising Percy's voice. At first, he
couldn't make out what the argument was and he decided to go on up
the stairs but then he heard his name followed by Ginny's. He
stopped, one foot on the bottom step, straining to catch what Percy
was saying.</p><p class="calibre8">"-well
then, why is she in St Mungo's right now?" Harry's heart sank.
He knew the answer to that question – because of him. It sounded
like Percy knew it too. Harry took his foot off the bottom step and
leaned back against the wall, tipping his head back to rest on it and
willing the tears not to fall. He was jolted out of his self loathing
by a new, louder voice.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
Goyle's an idiot," said Ron scathingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
but why did Goyle go after her?" insisted Percy. Harry knew the
answer to that question too – because of him. He sighed heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
your point?" demanded George's voice suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
if she wasn't inv-"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't believe you're blaming Harry for this," Harry heard
Hermione say quietly. He'd heard enough and stepped into the room.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hermione,
can you help me with something, please?" he asked, watching with
satisfaction as seven heads whipped around in surprise and Percy
turned purple with embarrassment. "Mum sent me to get Ginny's
things. I think you'd have a better idea of what she needs than I
do."</p><p class="calibre8">"Does
she need to stay in?" asked Ron, jumping up. Harry shrugged
wearily.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know," he admitted, "maybe. Mum sent me home because they
wouldn't let any of us in to see her and I … sort of shattered
three of the light fittings in the waiting room." Harry ran a hand
through his hair as he grimaced wryly. Ron smirked.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
it could have just been an excuse to get you out of there?" asked
Hermione gently. Harry nodded. He wasn't so blind that he hadn't
worked that out. He had protested at first, not wanting to leave
Ginny, however he soon realised that refusing to do something that
helped Ginny didn't look anywhere near as dedicated as it felt. And
that was how he found himself pushed through a Floo by Molly Weasley.
When he'd finished his musings he realised Hermione was still
talking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
she'll want something to change into in any case," she muttered
as she gathered up a pile of books. "And I expect a hairbrush will
be handy." Hermione kept talking as she left the room, patting
Harry absently on the shoulder as she passed by him in the doorway,
her pile of books teetering ominously.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
will go and 'elp 'er," said Fleur as she rose from her seat.
Harry leaned against the doorway as she passed. She stopped and
turned back to him, reaching up to touch his cheek. "She weel be
alright 'Arry. Teddy, 'e ees fine and Andromeda sends Ginny 'er
love."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
just looked away from her, staring into space and hoping he didn't
start crying, wishing desperately that he wasn't there, that he
could just see Ginny. He didn't know how she was, he didn't
understand why he'd been unable to see her and the worry was
growing in the pit of his stomach. Fleur was gone but Harry didn't
move. He was roused from his stupor only by Ron touching his arm.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
and sit down, mate," he said softly and Harry let himself be led to
a chair near the fireplace. He sank into it and dropped his head into
his hands. No one said anything for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"How's
Dora?" Harry asked suddenly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
fine," said Ron. "We got some kind of potion for her, but she'll
be fine."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Having
a dog is just not as simple as a Pygmy Puff," said Percy
officiously. Harry jerked his head up and looked at Percy as he once
again began droning about responsible pet ownership.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
did you come anyway, Percy?" he asked, startling himself. He had
not intended to voice his thoughts. Percy stopped talking and closed
his mouth with a snap. "Was it just to debate whether or not Ginny
and I can take care of a dog?"</p><p class="calibre8">The
room fell silent and Harry suddenly regretted his outburst. Starting
a war with Ginny's brother was a sure way to mess things up. He
fell silent. Percy, on the other hand, seemed to suddenly have a lot
to say.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that's just the thing, isn't it?" he began. "Why do you and
Ginny even <em class="calibre9">have</em>
a dog? You don't have any business having a <em class="calibre9">pet</em>
together! She's only seventeen and she's obviously still a target
for all sorts of nefarious characters! No doubt that was brought
about by the reckless disdain for authority which she shows. I wonder
where she learned that?" Harry just stared at him. Percy wasn't
subtle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy,
I'll see you outside," interrupted Charlie. He looked dangerous,
his burly forearms flexed as he jerked his thumb towards the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
really don't think-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
you don't," said George as he pulled Percy to the door in one
swift motion. Percy was flung about like a fish on the end of a
fishing line and Harry couldn't help noticing that George didn't
move quite the same as he used to. He rather fancied that if Fred had
been there Percy would have been frog marched stiffly through the
door, a twin on either side. As it was, George had him by one arm and
hauled him ungracefully through the doorway, bumping Percy into the
door frame on the way out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Be
careful!" called Bill as Harry heard the kitchen door swing open.
"Don't spill any blood; Mum doesn't need another child in St
Mungo's right now!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,"
murmured Harry miserably to Ron and Bill.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
for?" asked Ron. "It's not like it's your fault he's still
an idiot."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
it is my fault Ginny's in St Mungo's right now," Harry said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
that's rubbish," Ron scoffed. "She's there because she didn't
tell her secrets. She's there because no one believed her when she
said someone was watching her. If it's anyone's fault it's
ours. We could have listened to her. Perhaps if we listened to her
more she'd tell us more of her secrets."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
believed her didn't you Harry?" asked Bill gently. Harry nodded.
"You believed someone was watching her."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
we thought it was just a reporter or something though."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
<em class="calibre9">get</em>
her, Harry," said Ron. "You get her in a way we don't."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you know why she got that detention?" Harry asked them bitterly.
Ron and Bill shook their heads. "Snape saw her with a picture of
us, under a tree. It looks a bit like my Mum and Dad."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
I've seen that one," admitted Bill. "It's a nice photo, until
you start kissing her." Harry blushed and Bill grinned at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shove
off," Harry muttered. "She got that three week detention because
Snape saw her with that photo; because she was with me."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you can't blame yourself for that, Harry," said Ron reasonably.
"It's not like you handed out the detention personally. I can
imagine you with the power to give detention. Malfoy, you're
breathing! Detention, with Hagrid, in the Forest and whatever crazy
animal he's cooked up today!" Harry smiled in spite of himself
and he wondered if he'd be able to give a detention in the course
of his alleged supervisory duties. He'd have to ask McGonagall.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
going to have to stand up to Percy, you know," said Bill suddenly,
breaking into his thoughts. "About Ginny. Charlie and George aren't
going to convince him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
and somehow I am," snorted Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
you managed to convince me," said Bill. "Last night, you pretty
much told me to watch everything you did. So I did. You stood up for
her, when she was upset she was your first priority. You apologised
for holding things up; you thanked her for helping you. You treat her
the way I want my sister to be treated; like she's the most
important person in the world."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
treat her the way Bill treats Fleur," said Ron. "But you have <em class="calibre9">got</em>
to shut Percy up."</p><p class="calibre8">"But
… I-"</p><p class="calibre8">"If
it was anyone else but Percy would you have told him off by now?"
demanded Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Probably,"
muttered Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
why not Percy?" insisted Ron. "He's being a right git."</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
yes, that's good form isn't it?" said Harry sarcastically.
"Hello, Percy, I think it's great that you are willing to talk to
your family again, so why don't you shut up?" Hearing footsteps
on the stairs he got up and strode to the door, running into Hermione
who was carrying a small bag.</p><p class="calibre8">"Here
you go Harry," she said, handing it to him. "Anything Ginny needs
should be in there."</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
Harry murmured. "I'll just head back-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Talk
to Percy first," said Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
leave it, Ron," snapped Harry. "I'm not about to start a fight
with Percy. It's the last thing anyone needs right now."</p><p class="calibre8">"It
doesn't have to be a fight," insisted Ron. "Just tell him.
That's the end of it."</p><p class="calibre8">"It
won't be the end of it though Ron," said Harry miserably.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you on about?" demanded Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
Percy isn't about to let Harry tell him what to do is he?"
interjected Hermione. "He's older than Harry for a start and to
Percy that means he's got seniority."</p><p class="calibre8">"Seniority?"
gaped Ron. "Who cares about bloody seniority?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Language,
Ron," said Hermione mildly. Harry just watched as Ron and Hermione
threw sentences back and forth. "He's older and therefore he
thinks he knows better than Harry and that Harry should look up to
him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Look
up to Percy?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
he's probably convinced that he is wise enough to understand just
about everything."</p><p class="calibre8">"If
anyone should be doing any looking up to anyone, Percy should be
looking up to Harry!" said Ron rolling his eyes at her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Besides,
I don't think it's sunk in yet that Ginny's an adult," said
Hermione, crossing her arms defiantly.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
seventeen, how can he get around that <em class="calibre9">fact</em>!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
Percy wasn't there, in fact he's missed the last three years
hasn't he? As far as he's concerned Ginny's probably still
fourteen!"</p><p class="calibre8">"So?
She had a boyfriend then too!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
I think it was a bit different to the relationship she has with
Harry," said Hermione. "Besides, it's not like you didn't
have a problem with that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I only had a problem because it was Michael and not Harry!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy
would have had a problem with Harry," mused Hermione. Ron snorted.</p><p class="calibre8">"They've
forgotten we're here," said Bill conversationally to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
do that," answered Harry, smiling. He had thought that the arguing
would diminish once Ron and Hermione got together but he'd been
witness to numerous small squabbles in the past weeks and now Harry
wondered if it wasn't something they enjoyed in a way he simply did
not understand. Conflict was definitely not Harry's thing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Getting
back to the point-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Hermione, what was the point?"</p><p class="calibre8">Hermione
huffed and put her hands on her hips.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy
will be offended if Harry tells him what to do-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
cares?"</p><p class="calibre8">"-
and it will start a fight," continued Hermione as if Ron had not
spoken.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
cares?" repeated Ron. "Percy'll get over it, eventually."
Hermione looked sideways at Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
Ron, perhaps you are comfortable with family fighting but," she
paused and Harry stiffened and turned away.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
it never lasts long," said Ron carelessly. "Bit of a dust up,
move on; clears the air in no time at all really ... unless you are
Percy the git, takes a bit longer then."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I've never had a sibling exactly," began Hermione, "but I
assume that's how it is with most siblings, yes." She stopped and
Harry sensed she was biting her lip. Bill came to her rescue.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
do you think Harry feels about fighting in his family, Ron?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy's
only been back for a couple of months, Ron," added Hermione. Harry
knew that everything Hermione and Bill said was true. He didn't
want to fight with Percy and not just because everyone was on
tenterhooks at the moment. If he caused a rift with Percy and it made
him leave, it would cause untold pain. Harry wasn't comfortable
with family fighting; it had never cleared the air at the Dursley's.
His mind wandered briefly to the Dursleys. They were another thing he
needed to sort out before he went back to school. He should see
Dudley at least. He forced his attention back to the conversation
still going on in the living room.</p><p class="calibre8">"-
but we'd back him up," Ron was saying. "Perce's lost his last
ally."</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy
doesn't back down without a fight," insisted Bill. "He may seem
a bit … ineffectual, but he's as stubborn as the rest of us."</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">You</em>
told Harry to stand up to him!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know that," sighed Bill, "but Hermione's got a point."</p><p class="calibre8">"Look,"
interrupted Harry. "I'm not doing anything about it right now. So
just let it go." He sighed and went into the kitchen to Floo back
to St Mungo's. Percy was sitting at the kitchen table, his arms
crossed and a scowl on his face. Charlie was leaning against one of
the sideboards and George was tilting a chair back on its back legs
and drawing pictures in the air with the tip of his wand. All three
were silent and appeared to have arrived at some sort of standoff.
Harry didn't say anything either, he only reached for the pot of
Floo powder. Taking one last look at the scene in the kitchen, Harry
stood poised to scoop up a handful of Floo powder when Ron came
bursting into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!
Wait!" Harry looked up questioningly and Ron brandished the small
wallet containing the Auror medallion at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
you left without this before," Ron explained, handing the wallet to
Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
Harry mumbled, taking it and stuffing it in the back pocket of his
jeans.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
is that anyway?" asked George. "And why'd it make Malfoy look
like he was about to wet himself?" Harry exchanged a look with Ron
who raised his eyebrows as if to ask Harry if he was going to reveal
its contents. Harry shook his head imperceptibly but before he could
think of something to say to George, Percy spoke up.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
an Auror medallion wallet," he said. "Where did you get one of
those Harry? They are highly regulated. Not something a person can go
about liberating and using without authorisation. Not even you."</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
a bit rich-"</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
Harry's!" Ron interrupted George forcefully. "It's got his
name on it!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry's?"
Charlie sounded surprised and Harry could see the curiosity on their
faces as he looked around the room. Bill and Fleur had come to stand
in the doorway and George had sat up straight, the legs of the chair
thumping to the ground. Percy broke the silence that had fallen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly
Ron, they don't go handing out Auror medallions like sweets from
the Hogwarts Express Trolley," he said disdainfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you calling me a liar?" demanded Ron. "You waltz out of our lives
for years and then you waltz back in and think you can take up where
you left off just because we're all in a state of shock? You think
no one will notice if you're being a git?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Really
Ronald-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
you Ronald me!" shouted Ron. "You haven't changed at all!
You're still calling Harry a liar! For Merlin's sake Percy, you
were <em class="calibre9">there</em>!
You saw him with Hagrid, you saw him defeat that ugly bastard! What
is it going to take with you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You
would hold past errors against me, Ronald?" Percy seemed
irritatingly calm. Harry was feeling decidedly not calm but Ron gave
him no room to express it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Past
errors? That's what you call them?" Ron said menacingly. "You
called Harry unbalanced and violent!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
well at the time-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
at the time, well what about now, what is your excuse now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think I have just a little bit more experience with The Ministry than
you do, Ronald, and I am telling you that access to those wallets is
very stringent," said Percy, starting to look a little bit irate.
"I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask Harry how he came by
it." All eyes in the room swivelled to Harry and he carefully put
the pot of Floo powder back on the mantelpiece.</p><p class="calibre8">"Would
it matter, Percy?" he asked quietly. "Would it matter if I told
you or are you going to keep looking for a reason, any reason to
question me about every little move I make?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
cares, Harry," said George. "Tell us, I want to know!"</p><p class="calibre8">"George?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut
up."</p><p class="calibre8">"Right
you are Harry!" George fell silent but he was grinning from ear to
where his other ear would have been and looking as though he'd been
waiting for this all year. Harry put down the bag Hermione had packed
for Ginny and crossed his arms, leaning casually against the kitchen
table so that he towered over the still seated Percy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you remember The Minister?" asked Harry conversationally. "Big
bloke, nice voice according to Witch Weekly? Very little hair?"
Percy just looked at him stoically.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know him!" piped up George. "Lovely bloke, used to come 'round
for tea. Oh, but of course Percy, you missed that. Right about the
same time you missed Harry here as he was proved trustworthy and
Ginny, you know … growing up." Harry did not notice the fireplace
start to flare just behind him.</p><p class="calibre8">"George?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Harry?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut
up." George gave a salute with a cheeky little grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
it just so happens that one of the people authorised to hand out
Auror medallions, like this one," said Harry as he pulled out the
wallet and flipped it open under Percy's nose, "is The Minster.
At least I am assuming he is because he's the one who gave it to
me. So forgive me if I think I came by it legitimately." Percy
seemed determined to remain unimpressed and his face twitched only a
little as Harry left the medallion swinging in Percy's face.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
did you see Kingsley, Harry?" said Arthur. Harry spun around with
a start.</p><p class="calibre8">"Er,
this afternoon, at Hogwarts," he said quickly. "How's Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She'll
be through the Floo any minute," Arthur said, smiling. Harry
stuffed the wallet back into his pocket.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
she all right then?" he asked and Arthur nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Healer eventually cleared her; she's more embarrassed than anything
else. So you lot," Arthur eyed his sons in turn, "just keep your
thoughts to yourself." Ginny's brothers murmured and shuffled
their feet in gestures that Harry took to mean they'd do as they'd
been told. The Floo flared to life and Harry and Arthur took a step
back to allow Ginny followed closely by her mother to step out. As
soon as she was clear of the fireplace Molly started brushing ash
from Ginny's hair and shoulders and generally fussing over her
daughter. Ginny stood stock still, her hands shoved in her pockets,
studying the floor intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought we'd never get out of there," said Molly, moving to brush
ash from Arthur. "Honestly the amount of paperwork those Healers
can generate defies belief. They had me sign at least six pieces of
paper before they realised Ginny is of age and then she had to sign
them all again.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
hello, Percy dear. It's lovely to see you. George sit on that chair
properly, legs down! Here Ron, you take this bag back upstairs and
fetch Hermione and see if her parents would like to join us. Bill,
stop slouching in that doorway and let your wife into the kitchen to
sit down, let's all have a cup of hot chocolate. Charlie, if you
insist on leaning on the sideboard, get the cups out of it." Molly
spoke and moved like a whirlwind as she moved through the kitchen,
ending up at the stove, her wand working frantically to pour milk and
measure cocoa.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
on, everybody sit," Molly said pulling out a random chair as if to
prove her point. "We'll have a cup of hot chocolate and then its
bed for everyone I think; it's been a long day."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
stood uncertainly for a moment as Ginny continued to study the floor.
He hadn't seen Ginny since they'd arrived at St Mungo's several
hours earlier. Harry Potter arriving with a young woman in his arms
had the distinct disadvantage of calling unwanted attention to them
but also had the distinct benefit of having them whisked quickly
through the reception area, bypassing the line in front of the
Welcome Witch and heading straight to the Fourth Floor. Ginny had
been levitated into a tiny room; the door banging shut on Harry and
her parents with a finality that could not be denied.</p><p class="calibre8">Now,
back at home, Ginny was still wearing the clothes he'd last seen
her in and although she looked tired and rumpled she did not look as
pale as she had then. But she looked so closed off that at first
Harry was unsure what to do. Then she looked up at him and it was all
the prompting he needed to reach out and pull her into a hug.</p><p class="calibre8">"All
right?" he murmured into her hair as she buried her face into his
neck, sliding her arms around his waist. She nodded imperceptibly as
he pressed a kiss to the top of her head. They stood on the hearth in
silence, the clang of a spoon stirring the hot chocolate and the thud
of Charlie setting out a row of cups the only sounds.</p><p class="calibre8">When
he heard the chairs scraping on the floor and the soft pop as the
flame on the stove went out Harry knew that the hot chocolate was
ready. Reaching a hand around his body he grasped one of Ginny's
hands and pulled her to the table. She sat down, letting her hair
fall like a curtain around her face. It tore at his heart to see
Ginny so unsure of herself and Harry reached out and gently pulled
her hair back, tucking it behind her ear and trailing his hand down
to caress the back of her neck. With his free hand he pushed a cup of
hot chocolate into her hands and Ginny raised it to her lips, giving
him a wan smile as she took a sip.</p><p class="calibre8">Letting
out a small sigh of relief Harry picked up his own cup. No one had
said anything for such a long time that Harry was startled when Ginny
suddenly spoke.</p><p class="calibre8">"Is
Dora alright?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
she's fine," said Ron, waltzing back into the kitchen and
snatching a biscuit as his mother brought a large plate of them to
the table. "The witch at the Magical Menagerie said that the adra …
adri-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Adrenaline
rush," interjected Hermione from the doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
that," continued Ron, "helped protect her or something." He
stuffed the entire biscuit in his mouth as he sat down and pulled a
cup towards himself.</p><p class="calibre8">"
'Mnotgonnap'tendIknowwhashmen',"
he mumbled, barely audible and spraying crumbs across the table.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
disgusting, Ron," said Ginny wrinkling her nose and flicking a
crumb back at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
Harry," said Charlie, "are you going to finish your story now?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
story is that?" asked Ginny. Harry felt all eyes in the room on
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
you got your Hogwarts letter, Harry?" asked Hermione suddenly.
Harry nodded and drank a mouthful of hot chocolate, wondering where
to start.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
have you opened it mate?" demanded Ron. "Where is it?" For one
heart stopping moment Harry couldn't remember what he'd done with
it. Then he realised that it was still in the pocket of the rather
ragged looking robes that he was still wearing over his jeans and
T-shirt. Hastily, he searched for the letter, finally pulling out a
now crumpled parchment envelope. Harry deliberately placed the
envelope carefully on the table in front of him.</p><p class="calibre8">"At
this rate it'll be time to get on the Express," muttered Ron.
"For Merlin's sake Harry, open it or I will!"</p><p class="calibre8">"You
seem awfully keen to see that opened, Ron," said Harry with a
cheeky grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
it's just dragging it out, isn't it," stated Ron rationally.
"Sooner you open that and put Hermione out of her misery, sooner we
can get back to when you saw Kingsley and explain what's in your
pocket."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
on earth are you talking about, Ron?" asked Ginny irritably.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry
has an Auror's medallion," said Percy, looking as though he had
just swallowed a lemon, "which is a curious circumstance."</p><p class="calibre8">"Have
you really, Harry?" asked Arthur sitting up sharply. Harry nodded
and pulled it out of his pocket and handed it to Arthur.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
I thought you were going back to Hogwarts?" said Molly frowning.
Harry nodded and sipped his hot chocolate. He knew he was driving
them all mad with curiosity and smiled slightly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
saw Hagrid today," he began conversationally. "He and Grawp both
looked well." Ron growled at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"The
Castle's looking in excellent shape," he continued. Ginny reached
over and snatched his Hogwarts letter. Harry laughed. "Oi! That's
my letter! You can't open my post!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop
me," she said as she stretched her arm out to put the letter out of
his reach. Harry reached across her to try and grab the letter but
she laughed and leapt out of her seat, darting across the kitchen.
She stood breathless at the other end of the kitchen holding the
letter and slowly running a finger towards the seal. Harry gave chase
and, completely ignoring the rest of her family still sitting at the
table, he pinned her to the edge of the kitchen sink with his body as
she squealed and tried to get away, the letter hidden behind her
back.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
reached both arms around her, his fingers closing on the letter and
he could feel her breath on his neck. His eyes travelled up the
length of her neck and along her cheekbone until he lost himself in
her eyes. They were sparkling with mischief and he was acutely aware
of the way her chest heaved against his own. His eyes travelled down
to her lips and he felt drawn to them and bent his head to kiss her.
He was inches from her lips when suddenly someone cleared their
throat and Harry jerked his head up quickly, blushing as he
remembered where he was. With a triumphant smirk he wrestled the
letter from Ginny's grasp and held it above his head.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
put her hands on his chest and Harry thought he'd die from the
exquisite torture as she stroked his torso where her family couldn't
see what she was doing to him. He twisted away from her with great
difficulty and made a big show of opening the letter. Percy was
scowling at him but he pretended not to notice as he pulled a sheaf
of parchment from the envelope. As he unfolded it something fell from
the folded sheets and sparkled as it spun its way to the floor. With
lightning fast Seeker's reflexes Harry snatched it out of the air
inches from the floor and Charlie let out a low whistle.</p><p class="calibre8">"Those
are some reflexes, Potter," he said with admiration. "The
Quidditch Cup is Gryffindor's this year for sure!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,
finally admitting Harry's the best Seeker we've ever had?" said
George laughing but Harry didn't join in as he stared at the shiny
badge in his hand and swore softly.</p><p class="calibre8">"What's
wrong, Harry?" asked Ginny putting a hand on his arm. Silently
Harry handed her the badge and Hermione must have figured out what it
was because she tore across the room and engulfed him in a hug to
rival one of Molly Weasley's.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
Harry!" she exclaimed. "Isn't that wonderful? Oh I'm so happy
for you!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not," grumbled Harry. "This is your fault." He pointed an
accusing finger at Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did I do?" asked Ron indignantly. Harry plucked the badge from
Ginny's grasp and tossed it to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"If
you were coming back that would be yours!" Ron caught the badge
and smiled.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
way mate," he said, getting up and trying to pin the badge to
Harry's robes. "There is no way that Head Boy badge was going to
anyone else this year." Harry sighed heavily as he fought Ron off
before eventually submitting to having the badge pinned to his chest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
because I need extra attention," he grumbled as Molly beamed at
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Look
George," said Ron, pushing Harry and Hermione together like he was
setting them up for a photograph, pretending to wipe a tear from his
eye. "We've got a matching set. Don't they look all grown up?"</p><p class="calibre8">"How
am I supposed to do all this?" said Harry exasperatedly. "Does
McGonagall expect me to be Head Boy <em class="calibre9">and</em>
Captain the Quidditch Team <em class="calibre9">and</em>-"
he stopped abruptly.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
what Harry?" Ginny asked quietly. Harry took a deep breath as he
pushed Ron's hand away from buffing the glittering Head Boy badge
still pinned to his rumpled and stained robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know why there is no Seventh Year Defence text," he said heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
not?" Hermione leaned towards him eagerly, clearly anxious to learn
this piece of news.</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
there's no professor," he said simply. Hermione studied him
carefully but didn't say anything.</p><p class="calibre8">"They
don't have a Defence teacher?" asked Ginny incredulously. "That's
got to be the stupidest thing I have ever heard. They haven't been
able to find anyone? Anyone at all?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
there is a Defence teacher," clarified Harry. "Just not for the
Seventh Years."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that's not fair!" Ginny cried at the same time that Hermione
gasped.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
because of you, isn't it?" she asked shrewdly and Harry nodded.
"That's why Professor McGonagall wanted to see you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Lucius
Malfoy has managed to wrangle his way back onto the Governor's
Board, and the Board, in its wisdom, has decided that only an Auror
can be the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher," Harry explained.
"The Auror Department is a little depleted at the moment and
finding one has been difficult. They found one but he refuses to
teach me."</p><p class="calibre8">"So
either you drop Defence or none of the Seventh Years can do Defence?"
asked Hermione, frowning. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"McGonagall
and Kingsley are concerned about public opinion and the legitimacy of
the course if Harry Potter does not take Defence Against the Dark
Arts," said Harry heavily.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I can imagine that would cause some surprise and yes the letters home
would raise a few eyebrows," murmured Hermione. "I'm sure we
can trust Rita Skeeter to make up something outrageous to explain
that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Hang
on!" said Ron. "You've suddenly got an Auror medallion."
Harry stood waiting for the pieces to fall into place and it took
only seconds for Hermione to figure out what had happened.</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
teaching Seventh Year Defence Against the Dark Arts!"</p><p class="calibre8">"In
a manner of speaking," he said, shrugging. "It's just to get
around the red tape. It seems to have been Dumbledore's idea."</p><p class="calibre8">Ron
frowned at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"His
portrait self was looking mighty smug," continued Harry. "I got
the impression that Malfoy was being difficult about the Auror
stipulation. Personally I think McGonagall and Kingsley wanted to
wave two fingers at Malfoy and the Board. Kingsley seems to have
created a new Auror Division, of which I am currently the only
employee. McGonagall says I don't have to actually teach anything –
apparently I already did all that back in our fifth year." He
smiled a little wryly.</p><p class="calibre8">The
kitchen erupted and Molly soon had him in a bone crushing hug of
congratulations. A short time later, when things had settled down and
the dregs of the hot chocolate had been drunk, Bill, Fleur and Percy
began to get ready to go home. Harry was sitting at the table tracing
patterns on Ginny's back as she leant against him. She had so far
avoided her mother's attempts to send her to bed but it wouldn't
be long before Molly started on her again. Harry was contemplating
what it would take to get Ginny alone when Ron suddenly let out a
shout of laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
know what this means mate?" he asked, reaching out and buffing the
Head Boy badge again. "You do have the power to give Draco Malfoy
detention!"</p><p class="calibre8">***************</p><p class="calibre8">When
Harry came down to breakfast the following morning, he discovered
that Ginny was still in bed. He endured stoically as Molly launched
into a long-winded explanation of why Ginny should be allowed to have
a lie in, until George beckoned him from the doorway. Grabbing a
piece of toast and glancing at Molly sideways as she waved her wand
in intricate patterns over the stove, Harry hurried to the backdoor.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
outside," George hissed. "We've got time. Ron convinced
Hermione to go up to your room for a snuggle after she heard you come
down." Harry frowned at George.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are you on about?" he hissed back. "Are you trying to lure me
outside so you all can grill me about my intentions?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
sod your intentions, Harry," said George, pulling on his arm. "I
reckon you could declare your intentions to shag Ginny sideways right
now and no one would care. 'Cept maybe Percy. But he's a git."
Harry flushed a deep shade of red at the implications and allowed
George to drag him out of the house.</p><p class="calibre8">"Okay,"
said George after he and Harry were standing several feet from the
house. "I was thinking last night and I went down to the shop and
dug up some old papers me and Fred drew up a couple years ago. I'd
forgotten all about them. When we opened the shop we sort of wrote a
will. It's not official or anything so I need your help."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know anything about wills," said Harry. "I don't know
anything about legal stuff. It's not like I even made a will."
Now that he thought about it that was possibly quite short sighted of
him. Then he sighed, there was another thing on the growing list of
Things To Do before he went back to Hogwarts.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh,
don't worry about official legal stuff," George waved a hand
impatiently. "I need your help because you're the third share in
Weasley's Wizard Wheezes." Harry stared at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
am?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
said George, looking at him with one eyebrow raised. "Technically
you and me each own half right now. Course, <em class="calibre9">practically</em>,
we took your share and invested it back into the shop. It's not
like you've earned any money." Harry rolled his eyes at George.</p><p class="calibre8">"According
to these not legal, not official documents you and Fred wrote?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yep,
pretty much!" said George cheerfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
apparently, also according documents of dubious origin, Fred left
half his share to you and half to me?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
in a manner of speaking," shrugged George. "His third is
dissolved and divided between us." Harry nodded. He was fairly sure
that he almost understood.</p><p class="calibre8">"So,
what's the plan?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Plan?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
George, the plan?" asked Harry patiently.</p><p class="calibre8">"IwannagiveFredsharetoRon,"
George rattled off rapidly. Harry blinked.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
want to-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Give
Fred's share to Ron," finished George, slower this time.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like
an inheritance?"</p><p class="calibre8">"We
didn't write a proper will," admitted George showing Harry a
piece of parchment. "We should have. Bit short sighted of us
really, but one night we wrote this." Harry looked at the
parchment. There was nothing on it. He turned it over several times
before shrugging.</p><p class="calibre8">"There's
nothing here," he said. George looked at him pityingly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sometimes
Harry, I wonder at your lack of resourcefulness." Getting out his
wand George waved it around for a moment.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
solemnly swear that I'm allowed to read this," he muttered and
Harry burst out laughing. George looked offended. "Well, Fred did
write the first one in invisible ink but we couldn't remember which
brand it was and which remedy would allow us to see it and which
would permanently erase it." Harry watched as iridescent purple ink
began to scrawl across the parchment as if of its own accord.</p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">If
We're Dead</em>
was sprawled across the top in loopy writing.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
cheery," muttered Harry as he watched the rest of the writing
appear. George shrugged. The short note was written in two hands. One
purple and one lime green.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fred
had the purple ink," murmured George. "We had a fight over that
because I wanted it and he was being stupid and wouldn't let me put
my quill in that pot." He fell silent and Harry turned his
attention to the writing now complete on the parchment.</p><p class="calibre8">'<em class="calibre9">We
need to decide what happens if we're dead, Fred.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">You
or me?</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">We
should cover every eventuality.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">I'm
not planning on being dead, George.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Well,
neither am I, but these things happen.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Let's
give the shop to Harry.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Okay,
did we give him a third?</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Technically.
Did we tell him that?</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">I
don't think so.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">If
it's just me who's dead, you can have half and Harry can have
half.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Sounds
good, Fred. Same if it's me.</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">No
way, George, I'm keeping the entire thing!</em></p><p class="calibre8"><em class="calibre9">Let's
hope for Harry's sake it's you then, Fred.'</em></p><p class="calibre8">Harry
smiled as he read it although his eyes were suspiciously wet when he
got to the end.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
you want to give Fred's third to Ron instead?" he asked. George
nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
it seems fair."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
disagree," said Harry decisively.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
he's put in all this work and he's got some really good ideas,
Harry," George looked shocked. "I thought you'd go for this!"</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't need a share, George," he said, before George really got
going. "I didn't even know I had a share."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
admittedly you've never had a say in your share or seen any of the
profits but-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Exactly,"
interrupted Harry. "I'm not going to miss it am I? And I think
any debt for the start up money has been repaid." They both fell
silent. Harry studied his shoes intently.</p><p class="calibre8">"So
if you don't want to give Fred's share to Ron, what <em class="calibre9">do</em>
you want to do?" George asked eventually.</p><p class="calibre8">"Give
my share to Ron," said Harry raising his head to look at George.
"You said we both have a half share right now, so give my half to
Ron." George nodded slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
should have known you'd say that," he said, sighing. "I don't
know where my brain is at half the time these days. It's just as
well Ron's around really, nearly blew myself up making a potion
yesterday. He stopped me adding the wormwood too soon. Can you
imagine having to front up to the afterlife and look Snape in the eye
after that? Fred always used to stop me buggering up the potions.
Without Ron, I might end up on the other side prematurely. Which I
thought about, you know." George had trailed off to a whisper and
was staring over the horizon. Harry sensed how much that admission
had cost him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Did
you ever think about that, Harry?" George asked. "Just ending
it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,"
admitted Harry. "Right after Sirius died. It didn't last long
though." George shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Nah,
I don't feel that way anymore," he replied. The two of them stood
in silence, watching the sun light up the garden. "So you're
giving half to Ron?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
but don't tell him that," said Harry. "No one knows I even had
a third and Ron gets … funny about things like that."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny
knows you had a third," interjected George. "Manipulative that
one; can get all sorts of information out of you."</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
tell him he's inherited Fred's half," said Harry, laughing.
"He's not going to argue with a will. He's also not going to
want to see it. Paperwork is not his thing."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
about explaining it to Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"She
won't care," shrugged Harry. "She knows what's in my vault. I
think she knows better than I do actually. Besides she would have
made the same decision."</p><p class="calibre8">"She
gets to decide things with you, doesn't she, Harry?" asked George
suddenly and Harry nodded. "I don't think Percy understands
that." Harry just growled.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy
thinks we're too young and too involved," he ground out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
because he took six years to work up to a marriage proposal,"
scoffed George. "He said last night that Ginny needed to take her
time and explore her options. He's completely off his rocker.
Options? He thinks some bloke out there is going to understand her
better than you? That there are better options than the man who
worships the ground she walks on? He's completely mental if he
thinks she's going to find someone who loves her more than you do."
Harry shoved his hands in his pockets and shuffled his feet in
embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre8">"Don't
be embarrassed, Harry," said George urgently. "You've got to
stand up to Percy and tell him that. He's about as perceptive as a
cauldron bottom. Just tell him."</p><p class="calibre8">"Last
night, Ron and Bill said that I have to stand up to Percy," said
Harry slowly.</p><p class="calibre8">"There
you are then," said George impatiently. "It's unanimous."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
Charlie …" mumbled Harry. George waved an impatient hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
we really need to ask him?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
sighed heavily. He didn't want to cause a scene. He didn't want
to make Percy leave. He didn't want to be the cause of any more
grief. Why couldn't Percy just see this the way everyone else in
the family had? A shout from the back door roused him from his
contemplation.</p><p class="calibre8">"George!
Are we opening before noon?" Ron called. "Stop interrogating
Harry and eat something!" George turned to the house, grumbling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's
he channelling, Mum?"</p><p class="calibre8">"What
were you guys talking about?" asked Ron as Harry and George sat
down at the table. Molly was sipping a cup of tea, reading a recipe
book and Charlie was reading the paper. Ginny and Hermione were
nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy,"
said George quickly before Harry could dismiss it as nothing. Ron
started grumbling.</p><p class="calibre8">"Dozy
git. No idea that one."</p><p class="calibre8">"Ronald
Weasley!" exclaimed his mother. "I will not have you talking
about your brother like that!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Even
if it's true?" asked Charlie looking up from the paper. Molly
huffed and turned back to the recipe book.</p><p class="calibre8">"See,
she agrees with us," said Ron stabbing the air with a piece of
toast in his mother's general direction and turning to Harry. "You
have to talk to Percy."</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
drop it," said Harry tersely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny
will Bat-Bogey him if she hears what we heard last night," warned
Charlie.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
if Hermione gets to him first," muttered Ron. "You should have
heard her go off about it."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
will all leave your brother alone," said Molly as she stood up,
clutching the recipe book. "It's his birthday on Saturday and I
will not have it ruined by you lot. He hasn't had a birthday at
home with us for three years."</p><p class="calibre8">"Guess
we'd better get him a present then," murmured George looking
sideways at Ron. Harry saw them exchange a look that he would only
describe as mischievous and decided he was looking forward to it.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
I think you should," said Molly decisively as she went into the
scullery. Charlie leaned forward urgently.</p><p class="calibre8">"You've
got to speak to Percy before Saturday, Harry," he whispered. "Ginny
will hex him for sure by the end of the night if he is still being a
git."</p><p class="calibre8">"How?"
asked Harry listlessly. "He'll be at work." Charlie shook his
head.</p><p class="calibre8">"Honestly,
they told me you were intelligent!" he said exasperatedly. George
snorted and Ron grinned. "Make an appointment with him at work."</p><p class="calibre8">"Who
do you want an appointment with?" asked Arthur cheerily as he
breezed into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Percy,"
chorused his sons.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ah,"
was all Arthur said as he sat down and buttered his toast.</p><p class="calibre8">"Fine,"
grumbled Harry, "you win."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
catch him for you today, Harry," said Arthur, "tomorrow alright?
Probably best to set him straight before the party on Saturday. You
don't want Molly upset." Harry sighed; even Arthur thought he
needed to talk to Percy.</p><p class="calibre8">"Tomorrow's
fine," he said morosely and Ron clapped him on the back soundly,
making him drop his spoon into his cereal with a splash. Hermione
swept into the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
morning everyone!"</p><p class="calibre8">"See,
she's more cheery if we get to snuggle," muttered Ron in an
undertone.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't want to know," Harry murmured back. He raised his voice to
address Hermione. "Is Ginny up yet?" Hermione looked at him
apologetically.</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
she said softly. "I think she's awake though. But she didn't
answer me when I spoke to her." Harry looked longingly at the
kitchen door, willing her to appear. That didn't sound like Ginny.
She'd been up for breakfast every day even though it was the summer
holidays; she hadn't been a layabout in bed. She'd told him it
was because she wanted to spend all her time with him. She had seemed
all right the night before when he'd kissed her goodnight on the
stairs. He forced his mind back to Hermione who was still talking.</p><p class="calibre8">"-because
I really do think it's not good enough that people can get away
with just using Unforgivables," she said, waving a fork as if to
accentuate her point.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
it was war, Hermione," argued Ron. "Besides, you put every little
Slytherin on trial you'll have to put Harry right up there with
them!" The room fell silent. Harry could hear his heart pounding in
his ears. He hadn't given much thought to the fact that he'd used
Unforgivable Curses during the last days of the war and he looked up
worriedly at Hermione who was biting her lip.</p><p class="calibre8">"But
the Death Eaters have already been put on trial and I'm sure their
use of Unforgivables has been examined," she said. Harry could
barely hear her over the rushing in his ears.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
if they do want to do that to Harry?" demanded Ron. The room
blurred and Harry dropped his spoon again. The clang as it hit the
side of the bowl seemed loud in the stillness.</p><p class="calibre8">"No
one's putting Harry on trial," said Arthur softly. "There's
no record of him performing Unforgivables. Amycus Carrow was accusing
him but Kingsley could find no witnesses. Professor McGonagall seemed
to think something had addled Carrow's brain." Harry forced
himself to take a few deep breaths. The bile was rising in his
throat.</p><p class="calibre8">"Bill
said the goblins were a bit confused," added Charlie. "They
couldn't quite remember what happened when Harry paid them a
visit."</p><p class="calibre8">"Technically
Unforgivables were legal at the time," Arthur said with a grimace.
"I believe the prosecutors have had trouble having them admitted as
an accusation."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
put the Death Eaters on trial, but you can't do that to all the
kids who were just doing as they were told," Ron continued softly.
"War changes things." Harry wasn't so sure that it did at that
moment. At the time everything had seemed logical and right but now
he was fighting the urge to throw up.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
they should be expelled," insisted Hermione. "And Malfoy, he
shouldn't be allowed back in school! And making him a Prefect, what
was Professor McGonagall thinking?"</p><p class="calibre8">"He
never wanted to be a Death Eater, Hermione," said Ron. "Oh he's
still a slimy git, but he's no Death Eater; besides the Slytherins
need a leader. If there's a void there who knows what sort of
twisted little antics those ferals will come up with. McGonagall
knows exactly what she's doing.</p><p class="calibre8">"Like
Ginny said, too many of the little brats know how to use the
Cruciatus Curse now. They need someone to keep them in line and
Slytherins aren't likely to look up to Harry here. Whether we like
it or not, Malfoy still has some sort of influence."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
I hope someone's going to be very firm about the fact that the
rules have changed back," said Hermione firmly.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
why you're Head Girl, Hermione," smiled Ron. "Who better? And
that's why Harry's Head Boy. Everyone looks up to Harry, having
anyone else would be redundant."</p><p class="calibre8">"They
shouldn't," Harry mumbled, stumbling to his feet, intent on
getting some fresh air. He was losing the battle with the contents of
his stomach as he struggled to the door, knocking over his chair as
he stood. The memories of Bellatrix Lestrange in the Ministry and of
Imperiused goblins and Amycus Carrow in the Ravenclaw Common Room
were whirling through his head, at odds with Ron repeating 'everyone
looks up to Harry'.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry, are you
all right?" he heard Hermione say. Her voice sounded distant and he
didn't answer her as he clattered down the back step.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry!"
He knew Ron and Hermione were on his heels as he reached the lawn and
promptly leaned over and vomited onto a biting rose bush. Ron pulled
him back as the bush tried to bite him and he and Hermione led Harry
to a bench on the edge of the lawn. Ron pushed him down onto the seat
and Hermione conjured a glass of water and pressed it into his hand.
He took a huge gulp and dropped his head into his free hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
Hermione started. "You … it's different."</p><p class="calibre8">"How?"
asked Harry miserably. "How is it different?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
cause they were the bad guys," said Ron simply as he dropped onto
the seat next to Harry.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
not that simple Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
it is," insisted Ron. "They did bad things first."</p><p class="calibre8">"Do
you know why I used the Cruciatus Curse on Carrow?" asked Harry
bitterly. "Because he insulted Professor McGonagall. Cruciatus is
pretty severe for an insult wouldn't you say?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
but provocation mate," said Ron. "They did much worse than that
all year."</p><p class="calibre8">"Does
that make it better?" Harry asked, downing the last of the water
and twirling the glass in his hands.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
I think your reaction to it does," said Hermione softly as she sank
down on his other side. "You're not exactly revelling in it are
you? Anyway, I think if it came to it and anyone wanted to try you,
there'd certainly be grounds to grant a pardon."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
for services to the community or something," said Ron thoughtfully.
"Bit of an understatement though isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Pretty
big service," said Hermione. Ron snorted. Harry looked at him
sideways and then glanced at Hermione who was trying to hide a grin.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks
for saving the world, Mr Potter," said Ron in an officious voice.
"For that fine effort we'd like to keep you out of Azkaban. Here
have a plaque, its self shining." Harry started laughing and soon
the three of them were chuckling helplessly as they tried not to
slide off the bench and onto the ground.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
said Harry quietly when the laughter had subsided.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
truly not the same Harry," said Hermione.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not doing it again," replied Harry quietly. "It's hard enough
to live with things as it is. I just don't normally think about
it."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
expect there's a lot of things we'd all rather not think about,"
mused Ron. The three of them sat in silence for a moment. Harry's
thoughts wandered to Ginny and he wondered what she was thinking and
feeling.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
leaving for the shop soon," said Ron, breaking into his thoughts.
"You coming or … Ginny?"</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
just go up and see her," said Harry, glancing up at the house. He
started to get up and Hermione grabbed his hand. Harry turned around.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think she slept well last night," she said softly. "I –
I didn't want to say anything before, in front of everybody."
Harry nodded tightly a lump forming in his throat. He squeezed
Hermione's hand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Thanks,"
he whispered around the lump and let go of her hand to go back
inside.</p><p class="calibre8">*******************</p><p class="calibre8">Moving
boxes and stocking shelves at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes gave Harry's
mind plenty of time to think about Ginny. She had locked her bedroom
door after Hermione had left for breakfast and wouldn't let anyone
in – not even him. He could still feel the smooth wood under his
forehead as he leant against it, straining to hear her through the
door. She had eventually told him she just wanted to sleep and to go
to the shop with Ron and so he had let Ron drag him out the door, but
he'd been so distracted all day that he'd been precious little
help.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oi!
Potter!" he heard George call from the front of the shop. Harry was
in the store room looking for some fake wands and he had no idea how
long he'd been in there. Grabbing a box randomly he wandered back
out to the front of the store and listlessly handed it to George who
was standing near the counter which had been moved to near the window
during the refit he and Ron had done.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
want to go get some lunch, Harry?" asked Ron. Harry shook his head.
"You have to eat. Mum'll kill us if we don't feed you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not hungry," answered Harry dispiritedly, slumping into a nearby
chair behind the counter.</p><p class="calibre8">"That's
just a travesty, mate," answered Ron, shaking his head. Harry paid
little interest as George pushed Ron out the door. He was too
consumed with thoughts of Ginny. Why wouldn't she talk to him that
morning? How was she feeling? Would she let him in when he got home?
His thoughts were interrupted by George pushing a packet into his
hands. The shop was quiet with only two boys who looked like they
might be starting Second Year whispering to each other and pointing
at Harry while Verity served them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Can
you write some price tags?" George said. Harry looked up. He got
the distinct impression that George was searching for things to keep
him occupied. George dumped a pile of something grey and shapeless on
the counter. "Four Sickles each."</p><p class="calibre8">"What
are they?" Harry asked his interest suddenly piqued.</p><p class="calibre8">"Vanishing
handkerchiefs," said George. "Anything under them disappears.
Downright useful if you're trying to hide little things." He
rummaged about under the counter and pulled out a stack of small bags
with <em class="calibre9">'Vanishing
Handkerchief'</em>
printed on them.</p><p class="calibre8">"Does
seem useful," murmured Harry putting a quill, then a coin and then
the packet of price tags under a square of fabric. He watched as the
fabric blended in with the counter.</p><p class="calibre8">"Here,
put them in the bags and label them," said George. He paused for a
moment before he spoke again, in a completely different tone. "She
loves you. Don't think she doesn't." Harry looked up sharply.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know she does. It's not that. I just – she … we talk about
things," he said quietly. "I don't know what to do when she
doesn't talk at all. She doesn't talk about some things. She
thinks I haven't noticed but stuff to do with last year, she
doesn't talk about it. But she's never shut herself away before.
She lets me hold her. We talk about something else until she smiles.
I tell her how much I love her and I can tell she feels better. I
<em class="calibre9">want</em>
to help her feel better. If I can't do that, I feel useless."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know why Percy can't see it," muttered George, shaking
his head. He sat down next to Harry. "Ginny'll probably be ready
to talk when you get home. Verity reckons sometimes girls need space
or something. I dunno I stopped listening after about thirty seconds.
Besides, you're not useless. You've been a very good box carrier
today … even if we do have six boxes of puking pastilles out here
and no fake wands."</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry,"
muttered Harry, writing '14 Galleons' on one of the labels.
George took the quill away from him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
don't you go and help Verity?" he said, shaking his head again.
Harry got up and wandered over to where Verity was dusting a shelf
behind the register. A large neon sign proclaiming the re-opening
hung in the window behind her. Ron and George had spent an evening
with their father in his shed trying to get it to flash using magic.
Arthur had been fascinated but Molly had just asked why they didn't
just charm a sign to flash. The three wizards had just shaken their
heads at her ruefully. The sign now flashed in the window of number
ninety-three. Harry gazed out at Diagon Alley, past Verity's duster
and the flashing sign.</p><p class="calibre8">It
was busier than it had been last time he was here. Witches and
wizards hurried up and down the crowded street, he could see small
children darting between the shoppers and Hogwarts students with
packages of books and robes. Harry leaned on the windowsill and
watched as three boys approached, each carrying shiny new cauldrons
and assorted packages that Harry knew were books and robes. He
thought they must be First Years. The boys stopped in front of the
window, perhaps lured by the flashing sign. Harry watched in
amusement as the blond boy in the middle made eye contact, his jaw
dropping.</p><p class="calibre8">Without
breaking the eye contact, the boy nudged each of his friends with his
elbows. Soon all three boys were staring, open mouthed at Harry who
smiled and tipped his head towards the door. The boys looked at each
other uncertainly before they shuffled as one to the door and pushed
it open cautiously. As the last one timidly stepped inside Ron came
barrelling through, knocking the smallest headfirst into a large bin
of trick wands. The child's legs waved helplessly in the air and
his muffled shouts rang through the shop. Ron grabbed the back of his
robes, tossing the parcel in his hands to Harry who caught it with
ease. Hauling the small boy out, Ron set him on his feet.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sorry
about that!" he said cheerfully. "Didn't mean to upend you."
The boy looked up slowly at Ron, who towered above him. Harry
chuckled quietly imagining the boy's reaction to Hagrid when they
stepped off the train at Hogwarts. The noise drew the gaze of the
other two boys and they looked at him solemnly for a moment. Finally
the blond child who had first noticed Harry seemed to shake himself
out of his stupor and he took a step towards Harry and held out his
hand, offering it formally for Harry to shake.</p><p class="calibre8">"Good
afternoon," the child intoned, in what he had probably been taught
were good manners. "My name is Othello and it is a pleasure to meet
you." Harry stuck his hand out in return.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry
Potter, good to meet you too," he said. "Are you shopping for
your Hogwarts things?" The boys nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
need to get our wands now," volunteered the third boy. He had mousy
brown hair and mischievous glint in his eye. "Dexter's still got
his birthday money though. I've been trying to talk him out of
getting a toad. No one has toads anymore." He rolled his eyes
expressively. Dexter was obviously the one Ron had knocked into the
bin of wands because he scowled as he turned to his friend.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
do you know that!" he scoffed. "For all you know, everyone might
have a toad!"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,
they really don't," said Ron carelessly. "Only Neville's got
a toad. I don't think anyone else ever had a toad. You should get
an owl. Dead useful, an owl." The boy's face fell.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't think I can afford an owl," he said. Ron squatted down in
front of Dexter and looked him straight in the eye.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
having a toad isn't such a terrible thing and Trevor might like a
friend," he said.</p><p class="calibre8">"Who's
Trevor?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville's
toad," volunteered Harry. "I can introduce you when we get to
Hogwarts if you like. Neville must know heaps about looking after
toads."</p><p class="calibre8">"Are
you going to Hogwarts this year?" asked Othello, his eyes wide.
Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Wicked,"
breathed Dexter. Harry didn't get a chance to answer because at
that moment a heavily made up and finely manicured woman, her arms
bristling with parcels, burst through to door of the shop.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hamish!
There you are! What are you doing in here? I have been looking for
you everywhere!" she shrieked. The mousy headed boy grimaced. "And
<em class="calibre9">what</em>
have I told you about talking to strangers?" She eyed Ron rather
distastefully and he hurriedly stood up and straightened out his
robes.</p><p class="calibre8">"We're
not talking to strangers Mum," sighed Hamish, rolling his eyes.
"And the war's over now you can stop panicking like, every five
seconds." Hamish's mother was not placated.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
have been <em class="calibre9">entrusted</em>
with the care of your little friends and I take that responsibility
seriously, young man," she said firmly. "I don't care if you
are talking to Harry Bloody Potter himself; you do not just wander
off like that!" Harry stifled a snort and Ron turned blue as he
held his breath in an effort not to laugh. The boys went red with
embarrassment and glanced sideways at Harry who was managing not to
laugh, barely. Hamish's finely manicured mother went on.</p><p class="calibre8">"Just
five minutes, I ask you to wait while I visit the facilities and do
you stay there? No, you wander off," she ranted. "You had me
absolutely <em class="calibre9">sick
</em>with
worry, I was about to find an Auror and file a missing persons
report! You mark my words, your father is going to hear about this
little escapade and you two – your mothers <em class="calibre9">will</em>
be told. There will be something to say about this! Now come along.
We're getting your wands and going <em class="calibre9">straight</em>
home." She strode to the door and held it open imperiously. The
three boys shuffled their feet and gathered their packages.</p><p class="calibre8">"Seeya,"
said Hamish softly. Ron grabbed at something on a shelf hastily and
dropped three small items into Dexter's cauldron as he passed by.</p><p class="calibre8">"Use
those on Filch, the caretaker," he whispered and the three boys
grinned at him as they moved to the door. Ron grinned back, "or the
Head Boy. I heard he's a real stickler." The door shut after them
as they were hurried out the door and down the street. Harry watched
through the window as they went and Dexter and Hamish turned to wave.
Harry waved back and then chuckled as Hamish's mother turned around
to berate them but caught sight of Harry instead. Her eyes widened
and a flush stained her cheeks. Harry waved at her cheekily and she
returned the wave timidly before turning and hustling the boys away.</p><p class="calibre8">The
afternoon was a blur to Harry. He stayed behind the counter to help
Verity and was clearly visible from the street. A number of people
came in to see Harry Potter and left with a purchase.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
should have put you in the window this morning mate," said Ron as
he wrapped up a package of Wonderwitch products for a young girl who
was staring avidly at Harry. The shop was crowded and she stumbled
into four display bins, two other customers and a stuffed dragon that
George had enchanted to breathe fire at shoplifters, before making it
to the door.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah
and have half the customers so star struck they can't walk in a
straight line?" asked Harry sceptically.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
that is an unfortunate side effect …"</p><p class="calibre8">Weasley's
Wizard Wheezes did a roaring trade all afternoon and Verity taught
Harry how to ring up the sales. He found the hustle and bustle and
the people distracted him and kept his thoughts from dwelling on
Ginny too much and how she was doing. He still couldn't wait to see
her, to find out if she was all right, but the wait was easier now
that his mind was occupied.</p><p class="calibre8">******************</p><p class="calibre8">George,
Ron and Harry Apparated into the garden at The Burrow shortly before
tea time. Hermione was sitting in a lawn chair reading a book and
looked up at the sound of Ron's barking laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought that old man was going to faint when you put his stuff
through the till," said Ron. "I loved watching people's faces
today. It was fabulous."</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
Ron," said Harry. "It was bloody wonderful. You aren't the one
with squashed fingers from the hand shaking."</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
a good job Fred and I had stocked up on bruise paste," said George.
"Although I think the first order of business tomorrow is to move
that rack of punching telescopes from next to the counter. If people
would just look where they are going, they wouldn't get smacked in
the face. That never used to be a problem."</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry
never used to be standing there distracting people," smirked Ron.
"How many marriage proposals did you get today, mate?" Harry
rolled his eyes as Hermione made her way over the grass to meet them
as they wandered towards the house.</p><p class="calibre8">"It
was only one," he protested. "And I don't think you can take
marriage proposals from four year olds seriously, Ron."</p><p class="calibre8">"Her
mother looked mighty interested however," laughed Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
hot," added George.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
I didn't see a ring on her finger," continued Ron as Hermione
reached them and he snaked an arm around her waist.</p><p class="calibre8">"Well,
she's not going to get very far with me," said Harry grumpily as
he watched Ron and Hermione greet each other and wondered where Ginny
was.</p><p class="calibre8">"She
might get somewhere with me," answered George, puffing out his
chest. "Or should I say, I might get somewhere with her." Harry
shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
got a date, with her, didn't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure
did!" said George proudly. "With her and another with a sweet,
sweet witch named Felicity."</p><p class="calibre8">"You're
incorrigible," said Hermione, as they pushed open the door and
entered the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do try," was all George said as he greeted his mother with a kiss
and headed to the pantry.</p><p class="calibre8">"George,
tea's nearly ready!" Molly scolded at his retreating back. George
mumbled something indistinguishable from the depths of the pantry
before popping his head back out.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mother,
your feats in the kitchen render me unable to wait," he retreated
back into the tiny room and Molly turned to Ron.</p><p class="calibre8">"He's
in a very good mood," she whispered.</p><p class="calibre8">"Women,"
Ron whispered back. His mum looked more worried than mollified by
this but she didn't comment.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
did it go today, dears," she asked instead as she resumed directing
knives with her wand.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
it was brilliant mum," George said re-emerging from the pantry and
picking up two of the potatoes lying on the table and beginning to
juggle them. "Mind you, it doesn't hurt to have Harry Potter
sitting in the window!" Molly levitated the potatoes back to the
table and directed them under the knives. Soon they were peeling and
chopping with precision.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
can't believe you," said Hermione shaking her head. "Harry is
not a window decoration!"</p><p class="calibre8">"Tell
that to the single witches," muttered Ron as he grabbed a piece of
carrot.</p><p class="calibre8">"Shut
up," mumbled Harry as he swiped a piece as well.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
boys just wait for tea!" Molly scolded, but she was smiling as she
slapped at their hands. Harry just grinned at her and George reached
over to grab a piece as well.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
was working, I'll have you know, Hermione," said Harry smugly.
"The counter is near the window at the present time."</p><p class="calibre8">"Well
…" Hermione trailed off she seemed to have no argument for that
and Ron slipped his arms around her and pulled her close.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
would never exploit Harry," he said as he nuzzled her cheek. "And
you know it. You just like to have an argument." Hermione blushed.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
do not," she protested weakly.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yeah,
you do," said Ron as he kissed her. Harry and George groaned in
unison. Molly just sighed wistfully.</p><p class="calibre8">"Come
outside for a walk with me," Ron said to Hermione as he tugged on
her hand. A flushed Hermione agreed and George took a seat at the
table, smirking.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure,
you go for <em class="calibre9">a
walk</em>,"
he said. Harry watched as Ron gestured rudely at George behind
Hermione and his mother's back and left.</p><p class="calibre8">"Where's
Ginny?" Harry asked. Molly's face fell.</p><p class="calibre8">"She's
in her room," she said. "She hasn't been out all day."
Harry's eyes darted involuntarily upwards and his stomach clenched.</p><p class="calibre8">"All
day?" he asked faintly. Molly nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't know what to do," she said softly, directing the vegetables
into pots on the stovetop. "She's of age now and she's warded
that door with who knows what. Where does anyone learn that sort of
privacy charm?" Harry swallowed. He knew exactly where she'd
learnt them. The charms Hermione had used in the forests and on the
moors when they were camping had come in very handy for stolen
moments in The Burrow's garden. Ginny must have been watching him
pretty closely.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'll
just go up and see if she's … ready for tea," he muttered.
Molly caught his eye and she smiled at him as if she expected Harry
to succeed where she had failed. He hoped he could because he had no
idea what he was going to say.</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
stood uncertainly on the landing and wondered if Ginny would hear him
through the enchantments she had cast on the room. He reached out and
touched the door. The wood felt smooth under his fingertips. He
knocked and then hesitated, his hand reaching for the doorknob. Would
he be able to go inside?</p><p class="calibre8">His
fingers closed around the battered doorknob and it rattled in his
hand as he turned it. The hinges let out a protest as Harry pushed on
the door and he winced at how loud the sound was in the stillness. He
heard a faint rustle from inside the room as he stepped through the
doorway.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny?"
he called softly as he looked around the door. Ginny was sitting on
her bed, her knees drawn up to her chest and she was staring into
space. Harry stepped further into the room. "Can I come in?"</p><p class="calibre8">"You
already are," replied Ginny. She didn't look at him but kept
staring into space.</p><p class="calibre8">"Mum
said you warded the door," he said as he closed the door behind
him.</p><p class="calibre8">"Not
against you," she whispered, "never against you." Harry stood
in the middle of the room, unsure what to do next. He watched as she
tilted her head back and leant against the headboard, staring at the
ceiling.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
guess you picked up a few things watching those charms I've been
casting," he said eventually. Ginny shook her head and let out a
sharp bark of laughter.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
looked them up last year," she said bitterly. "Death Eaters can
get through regular locks. I needed something a little more
sophisticated. Something <em class="calibre9">Alohamora</em>
couldn't undo." Harry swallowed hard.</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
did you need-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Because
they came after me!" Ginny suddenly screeched. She leapt off the
bed and stood in front of Harry, her face flushed and her eyes
sparkling with tears.</p><p class="calibre8">"After
<em class="calibre9">you</em>
-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes,
they came after me!" Ginny said. "I could hear them stalking me
in the hallways. They knew Neville was covering for me and they came
after me anyway! Because I was yours; I've always been yours,"
she finished in a whisper. Harry didn't know what to say or what to
do but she held his gaze and he couldn't look away.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
I know healing charms because someone had to heal the First Years
when they weren't allowed to go to the Hospital Wing," she said,
wrapping her arms around herself. Harry reached out to her but she
shrugged him off and turned away to stare out of the window.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny
…"</p><p class="calibre8">"And
you left me. You weren't there," she whispered. Harry felt like
she'd just wounded him as surely as if she'd plunged a knife into
his heart.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
didn't want to," he said. "It was the last thing I wanted to
do."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know," she replied, her voice cracking. "I knew it wouldn't be
easy going out with Harry Potter. I just didn't know what sort of
hard it would be not going out with him."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
reached out to her again and this time she let him hold her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry," he whispered. "I'm so sorry." Ginny turned in his
embrace so that her face was buried in his shirt and he felt her let
out a sob.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
missed you," she said. "So much."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know," replied Harry as he stroked her hair. "I missed you too."
Ginny looked up at him, her brown eyes searching his.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
everyone thought I knew where you were and what you were doing,"
she said softly. "They all wanted to know. So I learnt privacy
charms."</p><p class="calibre8">"Why
today?" Harry asked. "Why did you use them today?"</p><p class="calibre8">"To
keep Mum out," Ginny said simply. Harry didn't believe her.</p><p class="calibre8">"Or
the demons?" he asked quietly. "You felt safer behind those
charms, didn't you?"</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
looked away. She didn't say anything so Harry sat down on her bed,
pulling her with him. Ginny leaned against his side and he held her
close.</p><p class="calibre8">"It's
been like a dream," she said quietly, "having you home. I didn't
want to tell you – anyone, about school because then I'd have to
think about it. Remember it. At first, it was like I was floating on
air. Even while I was crying over Fred I was walking on air because I
was walking with you. And there were too many things going on with
you. I pushed it all aside to deal with that. To help you-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny-"</p><p class="calibre8">"No,"
she shook her head forcefully, turning to face him. "Don't you
dare apologise. I wanted to. I couldn't have done anything else.
You needed us, needed me, and your need was definitely greater than
mine. Don't be sorry. Please, don't be sorry that you let me help
you."</p><p class="calibre8">Her
eyes bored into his and her tiny hands reached up to caress his neck.
Harry knew that he probably wouldn't have made it without her and
he shook his head.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
not sorry," he whispered, pulling her towards him until she was in
his lap. "Thank you."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
leaned forward and kissed him and he wanted to give himself up and
just kiss her back but not until she talked first. He wanted to know
what demons were lurking, pushed down in her soul. Physical affection
might banish them for now, but they'd still be lurking, waiting.
Harry pulled away.</p><p class="calibre8">"What
did you push aside, Ginny?" he asked. "What haven't you told
us?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Nothing,"
she muttered. "Everyone knows everything now. I was at school, I
was rebelling, I got in trouble and I got hurt. Neville and Seamus
had to cover for me and then I went home."</p><p class="calibre8">She
withdrew her hands from around his neck and wrapped them around her
own body and Harry felt suddenly cold.</p><p class="calibre8">"Sure
those are the facts," Harry tried again to get her to open up. "But
how did you feel? Heck, how are you feeling now?"</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
looked up at him, her hands dropped to her sides.</p><p class="calibre8">"How
did I feel?" she asked blankly. "How do I feel now?"</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
nodded, willing her to continue. She gazed at him solemnly, perched
on his lap, her legs straddling his, and suddenly her mouth was on
his and her hands were on his chest, pushing him onto her bed. Harry
could feel her body against his and the urgency in her kiss and his
arms came around her and he responded almost involuntarily, his mind
screaming at him to stop and his traitorous body urging him on.</p><p class="calibre8">He
knew this wasn't going to help, that losing herself in him wasn't
the answer she was looking for but her tongue was doing such
wonderful things in his mouth and her hands were everywhere and it
felt so good that he didn't stop her. Something new erupted from
somewhere deep inside and then it was no longer her need, but his.
His hands snaked under her clothing and he rolled over so that he had
her pinned beneath him. Harry was acutely aware of the way her
fingers were trailing up and down his back and the way she was
shifting underneath him. He felt all rational thought draining away
and the only thing in his world was Ginny. He groaned and tore his
lips away from hers to press them to her chin, her jaw, her neck, his
body pressing against hers urgently, betraying his desire.</p><p class="calibre8">But
when he felt tiny fingers on his belt, pulling at it, undoing it, it
was as though Ron had slammed open the door like he did last summer
and all the feelings vanished in a moment. Harry pulled away from
Ginny and caught her hands with his own.</p><p class="calibre8">"Stop,"
he rasped, still feeling his body ache with desire as she laid there,
hair strewn on the pillow, cheeks flushed and lips swollen and
bruised. She was so beautiful and part of Harry cared little for the
fact that this was not how he wanted to become her lover. But the
larger part cared for her too much to let that happen. "Not like
this. Not because you want to forget. Not because you'd rather give
me your body than talk. Not when there's a chance we'll regret
it."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
could never regret it," Ginny said fiercely. "I will never regret
a single moment that I am with you."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
would," said Harry softly as he raised the hands he still held in
his own to his lips and kissed them softly.</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
made a noise of protest.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
I would never regret that it was you, but I would regret that I stole
a moment when you were weak and vulnerable and willing to do
anything. I would regret breaking your trust like that."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
closed her eyes and Harry climbed off her, pulling her up to stand
next to him in the middle of her bedroom. He held her carefully and
kissed her forehead gently.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
don't want to make you cry again," he whispered. He tucked her
head under his chin and caressed her back gently as they stood in her
bedroom the curtains drifting in the slight breeze that came in the
window.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
was so alone," she said eventually, "so lonely."</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry," Harry whispered feeling like it had all been his fault.</p><p class="calibre8">"When
I got on the Express I realised," Ginny said. "I realised I was
all alone. For the first time I was away from <em class="calibre9">all</em>
my family. I might have pretended for years that nothing would make
me happier but really, not having Ron on that train for the first
time; it hit me so hard. I waved to Mum and Dad with this big cheesy
smile plastered to my face but I just kept hoping they were too far
away to see the tears. I was so mad; so mad at them. How could they
do this to me? Didn't they know? Didn't they know what was going
to happen? They must have known the Carrows were Death Eaters. They
just sent me off to Hogwarts – all alone."</p><p class="calibre8">"Attendance
was compulsory," Harry murmured into her hair. "You're
Pure-Blood, they had no choice."</p><p class="calibre8">"Neville
came along and found me standing at the window," she continued. "I
was just watching the scenery go by in a blur and thinking how every
clack of the train was taking me further away from them, and you.
Neville dragged me into a compartment and shoved me into a seat next
to Luna just before Malfoy came swaggering down the corridor
declaring that everyone had to sit down. Talk about a power trip."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
thought you'd be with Neville and Luna," said Harry. "I hoped
you were with them." Ginny looked up at him.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
were thinking of me?" she asked. Harry nodded.</p><p class="calibre8">"Every
spare minute," he replied.</p><p class="calibre8">"We
started planning then," Ginny continued, laying her head on Harry's
chest. He pulled her closer. "But at night, when it was just me,
alone in my bed, I was lonely. And during the day when I was trying
to dodge the Carrows I was lonely.</p><p class="calibre8">"Hagrid
and Professor McGonagall kept looking at me sadly, but they could
never tell me anything. They didn't know where you were any more
than I did. Everyone else was convinced I knew something. Goyle was
so pleased when he finally got to torture me."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
winced.</p><p class="calibre8">"Oh
there's no point prettying it up, Harry," said Ginny as she
pulled away from him. "He thought he'd be able to torture out of
me where you were, and earn points with Malfoy … or Snape or
whoever, I don't know. That's what he kept asking me. 'Where's
Potter? Famous Harry Potter; I bet he's told his little whore where
he is.' Every day – for three weeks."</p><p class="calibre8">Ginny
had backed away from Harry and was leaning against her bedroom door
with her arms crossed over her chest, tears glittering in the corners
of her eyes. Her voice was getting louder, harsher. Harry wanted to
take her in his arms and kiss the pain away but he knew he had to
hear it, he couldn't silence her. It was like a knife twisting in
his gut but he owed it to her to listen.</p><p class="calibre8">"And
after that detention finished Neville and Seamus started taking the
fall for anything I said in the hallways or at meals and they made
the sixth year boys do the same in class, I had to live with the fact
that they did that for me," she shouted, the tears pouring down her
cheeks. "They took that for me! I was running during the day and
healing everybody else by night and all because they wanted to get to
me, because I love you! And you weren't there! You weren't there
…"</p><p class="calibre8">She
finished on a sob and Harry could stand it no longer. In two strides
he was gathering her in his arms, trying to soothe away the pain and
the hurt. Ginny struggled, resisting his embrace, beating feebly at
his chest and the arms encircling her.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
was all alone," Ginny cried. "Nobody was there. You weren't
there. I kept seeing you, in my dreams. You were dead, always dead.
Every time I closed my eyes I saw you in a crumpled heap and you were
dead."</p><p class="calibre8">She
stopped struggling and wound her arms tightly around his neck,
sobbing into his shoulder. Harry suddenly knew why she'd burst into
tears that day on the Roobus and heard her protesting in the Room of
Requirement during the Battle.</p><p class="calibre8">"<em class="calibre9">I
can't go home! My whole family's here, I can't stand waiting
there alone and not knowing-"</em></p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry, I'm so sorry I wasn't there," Harry held Ginny close,
stroking her hair and whispering to her. "I'm not going to leave
you again. I promise. You won't be alone."</p><p class="calibre8">It
was some time later that Ginny unwound herself from his neck and
reached for a tissue.</p><p class="calibre8">"I'm
sorry," she said as she blew her nose. "I just-"</p><p class="calibre8">"Its
okay, Ginny," Harry replied. "I want to know. I need to know. You
can always talk to me. You can tell me anything."</p><p class="calibre8">"I
know I can," said Ginny shredding the tissue into tiny pieces.
"It's just … yesterday brought it all back and I've been so
happy the last few months, with you. I put it out of my mind. I had
bad dreams all night and I kept looking over my shoulder every time I
went to the bathroom. I just felt … paralysed, so I protected
myself the way I was used to doing."</p><p class="calibre8">"That
sounds perfectly reasonable to me," said Harry, levitating the
shredded tissue into the wastepaper basket. He reached for her hand.
"Thank you for letting me in." Ginny smiled at him and turned to
look at herself in the little mirror on the wall and began fixing her
hair.</p><p class="calibre8">"You
look a fright, dear," said the mirror. Ginny scowled at it.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
think you're beautiful," Harry said. Ginny arched an eyebrow at
him as their eyes locked in the mirror.</p><p class="calibre8">"I
rather think the tear streaked, puffy, red eyed look is stretching
beautiful a bit far."</p><p class="calibre8">"You
are always beautiful," said Harry seriously as he slid his arms
around her waist. He bent to kiss her, trailing wet open mouthed
kisses along her jaw and down her neck.</p><p class="calibre8">"Better
not let her mother see that," said the mirror. Harry growled and
pulled Ginny away from it and towards the bed. He wanted to kiss her
and touch her, their earlier encounter still fresh in his mind.</p><p class="calibre8">"Harry,"
Ginny protested, "I'm hungry. I haven't eaten all day." Harry
raised his head and gazed at her seriously. Her eyes were wide and
dark and he was very aware of her curves under his hands. He let out
a ragged breath and pressed a last kiss to her nose before letting
her go and entwining his hand with hers.</p><p class="calibre8">"Ginny?"
he said, stopping with his hand on the doorknob.</p><p class="calibre8">"Yes?"</p><p class="calibre8">"Next
time you go for my belt," he said looking down at her seriously.
"I'm going to let you undo it. I'm not going to be able to stop
next time."</p><p class="calibre8">Harry
hadn't seen her blush like that in a long time, but he didn't
miss the calculating smile either.</p>
